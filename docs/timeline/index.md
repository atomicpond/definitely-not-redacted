## How Dates Were Determined

Document dates were extracted using multiple sources, prioritized as follows:

1. **Email Headers** (High Confidence) - Date/time from email metadata
2. **Document Metadata** (Medium Confidence) - Creation/modification dates from file properties
3. **Content Parsed** (Low Confidence) - Dates extracted from document text via pattern matching

When a document group contains multiple duplicates with different dates, the canonical document's date is used, typically from the highest confidence source available.
