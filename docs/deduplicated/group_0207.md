    ﻿Japan Economics Viewpoint
    Ready for ignition
    18 November 2016
    Consensus underestimating GDP and inflation
    We are upbeat on Japan’s outlook and think consensus is underestimating the strength
    of medium-term GDP and inflation. We expect growth of 1.4% in CY2017 and 1.2% in
    CY2018, well above consensus of just 0.8% growth next year. For the first time in four
    years both monetary and fiscal policy are supporting growth. The combination of
    modestly higher commodity prices, a weaker yen, and a tightening output gap should
    drive Japan-style core inflation to 1.0% in CY2017, and 1.4% in CY2018. We expect the
    BoJ to keep its rate targets unchanged for the foreseeable future as inflation moves in
    the right direction.
    Fiscal and monetary policy realigning
    For years Japan has oscillated between loose and tight fiscal policy. Japanese
    policymakers now seem to be on the same page and we see little risk of another policy
    error. If anything, we see upside risks from greater fiscal stimulus via a third
    supplementary budget or a relatively aggressive FY17 ordinary budget. Meanwhile, the
    BoJ’s new interest-pegging regime ensures that financial conditions will become
    increasingly stimulatory as inflation rises.

    2017 – a year of recovering domestic demand
    We think the economy is heading towards a cyclical sweet spot and see a broad-based
    recovery in domestic demand. Specifically, 1) consumption is poised to rebound as the
    saving rate peaks; 2) capex should accelerate in response to the improving demand
    outlook, deepening supply-side constraints, and “low-for-longer” real rates; and 3)
    increased efforts by policymakers to accelerate income redistribution could push up the
    velocity of money at the margin, helping to reflate the economy.

    ﻿Cause and Effect
    Fade the Trump risk premium – buy USD
    13 February 2017
    Concerns over stagflation return
    In our view, the most interesting and important development in the global financial
    market so far this year has been the divergence between rising US inflation breakevens
    and falling US real yields. Rightly or wrongly, investors appear to have become
    concerned about upside risk to inflation and downside risk to growth.
    The Trump risk premium
    Informal surveys of our clients suggest that stagflation concerns are being fed by
    growing pessimism about the new Trump administration. Investors seem to think that
    potential trade wars and a border adjustment tax (BAT) would boost inflation while
    repealing Obamacare and the controversy regarding the BAT could delay the highly
    anticipated tax reform.
    Perception versus reality
    In this report, we argue why the Trump risk premium may be too high. The
    administration’s dealing with both China and Mexico in recent weeks suggests to us that
    the near-term risk of open trade wars has abated. We are also less concerned that
    Obamacare will take precedence over tax reform.

    Global Rates & Currencies Research
    Most crucially, we think the overall tax reform is less dependent on the BAT than usually
    thought. Our scenario analysis shows that what has been getting priced into the market
    since January (higher inflation, lower USD) may be actually the least likely path for the
    BAT. In more plausible scenarios, the USD does quite well and inflation breakevens
    should be either unchanged or lower.
    How to trade it?
    We could get details on the tax reform as early as the new president’s speech to joint
    session of Congress on February 28, 2017. We think this could validate our view of a
    stronger USD.
