    I was planning on writing both of you today or tomorrow if buzzfeed decided to go ahead with their story after I 
    wrote to them, but since they sent this to you here is what I was planning to forward.. namely my response to 
    their email and their original email. I hope it helps. They have clearly decided in advance to try to smear me, 
    and potentially other atheists (I found the remarks in their 'miscellaneous facts' telling in this regard), and I felt 
    a detailed response to the false claims was important. If you want to discuss this further I am happy to. I am 
    currently on a plane heading to phoenix. 
    Thanks for forwarding.

    I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your email. I am currently on a plane until noon pacific time, and then 
    heading to a meeting right after landing, till about 2 pm or so. While I am running the risk that you will report 
    my comments, if you do, either out of context, or incompletely, I am responding with an effort to be complete, 
    as I always try and do with reporters. If you decide to go ahead with a story, which, after reading my responses, 
    I hope you decide is inappropriate, I would like you to quote my responses fully in order not to distort them.
