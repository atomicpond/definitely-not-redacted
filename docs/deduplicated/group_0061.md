    On September 14, 1964, Dean Katherine Towle announced that existing University regulations prohibiting 
    advocacy of political causes or candidates, outside political speakers, recruitment of members, and fundraising 
    by student organizations at the intersection of Bancroft and Telegraph Avenues would be "strictly enforced."

    LAUNCHING A MAGAZINE 
    My friend Michael Simmons, who has been the editor of National Lampoon and High

    I was invited to write a column, named "The Naked Emperor," for Cavalier, that was beginning 
    to publish underground writers and artists. They paid me $1,000 a month. My first column was 
    a report on an auction of two-inch squares from the hotel bedsheets slept on by the Beatles during 
    their first trip to America. 
    There were 300 screaming young girls, off on a fetishist's holiday. Obviously, there wouldn't be
