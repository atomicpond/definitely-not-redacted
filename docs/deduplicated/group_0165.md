    Budgets, tax reform and “extenders”
    As the year winds down, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Budget
    Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D-WA) have hammered out a budget deal that forestalls – for two years
    – another government shutdown, and limits some of the forthcoming sequester cuts otherwise slated to go in
    effect in January. Although neither negotiator is entirely happy with the agreement, both view it as a
    workable cease-fire in the budget battles; the House passed the agreement 332 to 94 on December 12 th ,
    and the Senate passed it 64 to 36 on December 18 th . President Obama will sign the bill shortly, thereby
    making it possible for Congress to draft spending bills so as to allocate the budget dollars that have now
    been approved. Note, however, that this budget agreement does not address the debt ceiling suspension,
    which expires in February, and that another fiscal showdown is therefore possible early next year.
    As to tax reform, Sen. Max Baucus (D-MT), Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has recently put
    forth several discussion drafts of legislation, generally dealing with corporate and international tax, and
    energy incentives, while Rep. Dave Camp (R-MI), Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,
    acknowledged that he fell short on his goal of introducing tax reform legislation this year, but that he would
    rather focus on that than an “extenders” bill.
    What is “extenders” legislation, and how might it fit into the tax reform puzzle? Although “extenders” are not
    defined anywhere, they generally refer to temporary provisions of the tax law that Congress regularly renews
    – usually for a year or two at a time. For example, the research and development credit is an important
    business incentive that has been around since 1981 – and is again among the extenders that expire on
    December 31, 2013 (this year, they number 57).

    And the beat goes on…
    Last fall’s 16-day government shutdown ended with legislation that President Obama signed in the wee
    hours of October 17 th . Under that legislation, a bipartisan committee hammered out a budget agreement by
    mid-December; Congress approved the agreement, and President Obama signed it into law. House and
    Senate appropriations committees then began drafting spending bills – on which they compromised: H.R.
    3547, the “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014,” passed both the House and the Senate with comfortable
    bipartisan majorities; it became Public Law 113-76 on January 17 th , when President Obama signed it. The
    Act allocates $1.012 trillion, is over 1500 pages long and funds the government through September 30, 2014
    (the end of the current 2014 fiscal year).
    The Act restored some of the funding cuts otherwise dictated by the “sequester,” which was born of budget
    legislation (and the debt ceiling crisis) in August 2011. It covers discretionary spending for all government
    agencies, and has nothing to do with mandatory spending, such as Social Security. In other words, for
    example, the Act covers national defense, commerce, the judiciary and what are referred to as “financial
    services,” which includes the IRS. Although overall appropriations are up slightly for financial services from
    last year’s enacted level, the $11.289 billion appropriated for the IRS is about 4% less than last year, and
    continues a downward trend in IRS funding.
    Under the Act, the IRS will have new quarterly reporting requirements with respect to some of its spending,
    and must abide by some pointed directives, including maintaining training programs to cover items such as
    “taxpayers’ rights, dealing courteously with taxpayers, cross-cultural relations, ethics and the impartial
    application of tax law.” An additional $92 million is potentially available to the IRS to supple
