    HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030358 
    The subject of the email should have been warning enough for Jes Staley, the embattled 
    chief executive of Barclays. At quarter to nine on Wednesday evening, after a bruising 
    shareholders' meeting, Mr Staley received a message purporting to be from his chairman, 
    John McFarlane. The heading read: "The fool doth think he is wise". 
    In fact, the message was from a prankster, using the Gmail account 
    iohn.mcfarlane.barclays@gmail. com. The imposter described Michael Mason-Mahon, an 
    individual shareholder who called for Mr Staley to resign at Wednesday's annual 
    meeting, "as brusque as he is ill informed" and went on to reassure the Barclays chief 
    executive that together they had successfully seen off any attempt to force Mr Staley out. 
    HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030359 
    "Surely the fickleminded nature of the angry few will help tie up any loose ends," the 
    short email concluded. "You owe me a large Scotch." 
    Mr Staley, who has been heavily criticised for his attempt to unmask a whistleblower, 
    soon replied to the prankster in effusive terms. Presumably thinking he was talking to his 
    chairman, who has been dubbed "Mack the Knife" for his habit of ousting chief 
    executives, Mr Staley said, "You a
