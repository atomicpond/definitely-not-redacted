    Jeffrey Epstein, the Florida money manager who once roamed in the same social circle as Bill Clinton, Prince 
    Andrew and other high profile figures, is going to be released from prison early, a source tells 
    RadarOnline.com. 
    Epstein pleaded guilty last year to procuring teen girls for prostitution, ending his lifestyle with the rich and 
    famous in a Palm Beach, Florida scandal that reverberated through high-profile society. He received an 18-
    month sentence and was slated to be incarcerated until the end of this year. 
    But now, says the source, the jail door is about to swing open because Epstein has been secretly helping the feds 
    unravel a suspected Ponzi scheme. He had inside knowledge of the scheme because he was one of its victims, 
    losing $67 million. 
    The source says it's all tied to the indictment of former managers of Bear Stearns Mortgage Investment Fund, and 
    in that case Epstein is the person who is identified only as Victim # 1. 
    Meanwhile, Epstein's life behind bars hasn't been too rough — in fact he's allowed to spend most days at his 
    attorney's office. He was supposedly working on a charity venture but the source says he was actually busy 
    helping the feds with the Ponzi scheme. One source says that he's been guarded by men in suits with 
    earphones. 
    Well if those suits are going to follow him when he's freed they better pack bathing suits. Epstein owns Little St. 
    James Island in the Virgin Islands.
