    Dear Ms. Knowles-Carter, 
    Tel: 
    Fax: 
    I am writing now to invite you to be a featured guest of Poetry in America 
    (poetryinamerica.org). Poetry in America's first season's guests included Bill Clinton, 
    Joe Biden, Cynthia Nixon, Shaquille O'Neal, Yo Yo Ma, Samantha Power, Herbie 
    Hancock, John McCain, Nas, Angela Duckworth, Bono, Regina Spektor, Frank Gehry, 
    Stuart Weitzman, E.O. Wilson, and many others. Seasons Two and Three will feature just 
    as distinguished a line up. The series airs on public television stations everywhere, 
    streams via Amazon Prime and other streaming services, and it is now also airing on a 
    variety of domestic and international airlines. 
    The poem we'd read and interpret together is by the contemporary poet Evie Shockley, 
    and it's called "you can say that again, billie." It's a brilliant and beautiful poem that 
    speaks back to Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit" and evokes a whole history of gender and 
    race in the American South. You are the ideal reader for this poem. We would use what 
    we filmed together in an upcoming season of Poetry in America. We would also use the 
    content in materials that we are creating for K-12 classrooms in partnership with Harvard. 
    Everything we create would be educational and non-commercial. 
    Thank you for considering this request. I would be very honored to work with you. 
    Sincerely, 
    Elisa New 
    Director and Host of Poetry in America 
    Powell M. Cabot Professor, Harvard

    Dear Ms. Williams: 
    Tel: 
    Fax: 
    I am writing now to invite you to be a featured guest on my public television 
    series, Poetry in America (poetryinamerica.org). Poetry in America's first 
    season's guests included Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, Cynthia Nixon, Shaquille 
    O'Neal, Yo Yo Ma, Samantha Power, Herbie Hancock, John McCain, Nas, 
    Angela Duckworth, Bono, Regina Spektor, Frank Gehry, Stuart Weitzman, E.O. 
    Wilson and many others. In Seasons Two and Three we will have just as 
    distinguished a line up. The series airs on public television stations 
    everywhere, streams via Amazon Prime and other streaming services, and it is 
    now also airing on a variety of domestic and international airlines. 
    The poem I'd like to read and interpret with you is by Pulitzer Prize winner, 
    Sharon Olds, and it's called "The Language of the Brag." It's a gutsy poem that 
    compares feats of (male) athletic prowess-- and feats of poetic prowess-- to 
    childbirth. You are the ideal reader for this poem: indeed, I picked it for the 
    season in hopes you would be my co-interpreter. If you agree to film with me, 
    I'll use what we capture in an upcoming season of Poetry in America. I'll also 
    use the content in an online course for medical professionals I am creating in 
    partnership with Harvard Medical School. 
    I thank you for considering this request. I would be very honored to work 
    with you. 
    Sincerely, 
    Elisa New
