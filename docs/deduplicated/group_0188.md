    • As the year 2015 begins, we
    find ourselves at the height of a
    historic earthquake, in multiple
    dimensions, the like of which hasn’t
    been seen since the end of WWI and
    the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.
    • In the Middle East – within
    three years, the "Arab spring" turned
    into the "Islamic winter" – borders
    have vanished and centuries of
    conflicts between tribes and factions
    are erupting onto the surface.
    • The bi-polar and multi-polar
    world we knew has been replaced by a
    world with not even one geopolitical
    center of gravity. It is a Gestalt in
    which everything depends on
    everything else, and dealing with the
    challenges requires global cooperation
    .
    • Israel finds itself at the center
    of a kind of "perfect storm,"the only
    outpost of the western way of life in
    the Middle East – at the meeting point
    of the "clash of civilizations" between
    Islam and the West, as Huntington
    envisioned it, and at the same time, in
    the spinning "eye of the storm" of the

    the one hand, and modernity and
    moderation on the other; between the
    dream of "past glory" and the vision of
