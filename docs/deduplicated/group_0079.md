    HD: Wall Street, Take Two 
    DEK: In the upcoming sequel to Oliver Stone's groundbreaking film, Gordon Gekko gets out of jail and back 
    to business. Peggy Siegal takes us behind the scenes where she got herself on camera along with a few of her 
    famous friends. Nice work if you can get it. 
    In 1987, right after director Oliver Stone won the Academy Award for "Platoon," he immediately turned to a 
    domestic arena and began working on "Wall Street" in New York City where his father had been a 
    stockbroker. Although the film was widely seen as a scathing critique of the culture of Wall Street, Stone has 
    said that part of the film is a defense of capitalism, his father's vision of finance (as seen through the Hal 
    Holbrook character) and an homage to his father. 
    At the time Oliver was also fascinated with the connection between the psyche of Latino Miami drug dealers 
    from his earlier "Scarface" script and the American-born 28- to 35-year-old, white collar stockbrokers. Both 
    groups had an animalistic need to obtain big and fast money. They shared an obsession with corruption and 
    greed. 
    Oliver sent his actors to Bear Stearns for research, including then-newcomer Charlie Sheen, who played Bud 
    Fox, a kid from nowhere. When he learns to cold call, and lands one big client, Gordon Gekko, Fox is thrust 
    into the fast lane with a rock star financial mentor who teaches him corruption. 
    Oliver needed an old-fashioned villain to create drama, and he cast Michael Douglas as Gekko against type. 
    Michael was not known as a heavy at the time, but as a charming, handsome
