    Honorable Mark Filip 
    Office of the Deputy Attorney General 
    United States Department of Justice 
    950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. 
    Washington, D.C. 20530 
    Dear Judge Filip: 
    This letter briefly supplements our prior submission to you dated May 19, 2008. In that 
    communication, we urgently requested that your Office conduct an independent review of the 
    proposed federal prosecution of our client, Jeffrey Epstein. The dual reasons for our request that 
    you review this matter are (i) the bedrock need for integrity in the enforcement of federal 
    criminal laws, and (ii) the profound questions raised by the unprecedented extension of federal 
    law by the United States Attorney's Office in Miami (the "USAO") to a prominent public figure 
    who has close ties to former President Clinton. 
    The need for review is now all the more exigent. On Monday, May 19, 2008, First 
    Assistant Jeffrey Sloman of the USAO responded to an email from Jay Lefkowitz informing U.S. 
    Attorney Alex Acosta that we would be seeking your Office's review. Mr. Sloman's letter, 
    which imposed a deadline of June 2, 2008 to comply with all the terms of the current Non-
    Prosecution Agreement (the "Agreement"), plus new unilateral modifications, on pain of being 
    deemed in breach of that Agreement, appears to have been deliberately designed to deprive us of 
    an adequate opportunity to seek your Office's review in this matter. 
    The USAO's desire to foreclose a complete review is understandable, given that the 
    Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section ("CEOS") has already determined that our substantive 
    arguments regarding why a federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein is not warranted were 
    "compelling." However, in contradiction to Mr. Sloman's assertion that CEOS had provided an
