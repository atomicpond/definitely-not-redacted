    Eva is my friend there who will host us. She is very close friend with mette as well. 
    Eva and I are still trying to get mette to join at the last moment. 
    She and her family own 80% or so of Austrian media (Heute etc). She is describing program below. 
    The plan would be that we arrive to Vienna on Thursday 17th mid day. 
    On Thursday there is a big Premiere of Mozart La clemenza de Tito and we go to that. 
    ON Friday Eva is organizing a dinner/reception with her friends. We can schedule some other 
    meetings/visits during day. 
    On Saturday the night starts at 5pm and goes through early next morning. 
    leave first flight Sunday morning for San Francisco to meet Bill. 
    If you are staying in Vienna and have time (and like Eva) you should go to her brunch. 
    How this seems to you???

    Attached (sorry in Germain) the Programm fort he lifeball on the 19th. 
    Actually there will be a Galadinner with our prime minister and Bill Clinton and all kinds of stars in 
    the Hofburg (former imerial estate - very impressive to see from inside)) It is only 250 people,. A 
    seated dinner and more upscale than the rest oft he evening. It start's at 5pm with a champagne cocktail 
    and from there we go directly to the opening oft he ball where we'll have a really cool Box first row!! 
    presscode: actually the lifeball is really crazy and 'half naked' we always do a intermediare because 
    otherwise you feel like an idiot at the Amfar Gala dinner before. People now don't wear Tuxedos anymore. 
    christoph wear's normal black trouseres with a white shirt and a dar sakko because he doesn't want to be 
    in any crazy st
