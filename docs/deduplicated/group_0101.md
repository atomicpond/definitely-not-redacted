    Donald Trump says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia 
    Clinton attacks Trump's foreign policy as 'dangerously incoherent' 1 / 27U.S. Democratic presidential candidate 
    Hillary Clinton lambasted Donald Trump's foreign policy platform as "dangerously incoherent" in a speech on 
    Thursday that cast her Republican rival as both a dangerous and laughable figure. 
    A former U.S. secretary of state, Clinton attacked Trump for his policies and his character, suggesting Trump 
    might start a nuclear war if elected to the White House simply because "someone got under his very thin skin." 
    "Donald Trump's ideas are not just different, they are dangerously incoherent," she said to a room of supporters 
    in San Diego, California. "They're not even really ideas, just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and 
    outright lies." 
    ____0 Mike Blake U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton delivers a speech on national 
    security in San Diego, California, United States June 2, 2016.

    Un to try to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program and has criticized the decades-old NATO alliance with mainly
