    Will call you later. I am sick as a dog with a cold. I am supposed to go to Dr. Magnani this morning for a cleaning. If you get a 
    cleaning with a cold does it make it worse of just infect the dental hygenist? 
    Had a great lunch for Woody Harrelson and Ben Foster for "The Messenger" at Monkey Bar yesterday and hung with Clooney at the 
    New York Film Critics Awards last night. Tonight is the National Board of Review and I am thinking of staying in bed till show 
    time. Have a party for Clooney Wednesday nigh Graydon is hosting at Monkey Bar that we are working on. 
    I have to fly to LA Jan. 14 and I am worried.. .1 have emailed three doctors this morning! 
    Will call later...Mattie keeps saying she is going to show me how to email photos- will try to do today and call. 
    I think I got sick in economy class from Lamu, Nairobi, Amsterdan, Newark from all those wanna be terrorists breathing on me in 
    the planes. 
    Did you see "Avator". I do not have a dvd because its 3D. 
    The white American marines are wiped out by black people painted blue... its going to be highest grossing film in the world is an 
    few weeks beating out "Titanic" and will win the Oscar for "Best Picture."
