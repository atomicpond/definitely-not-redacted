    Reply-To: 
    Sorry again for that last minute cancellation in the Spring -- alas, 
    the perils of running a new center, that I no longer control my 
    schedule like in the good old days. But the Obama BRAIN Initiative is 
    running strong, and MIT has a good bid for a seat at the table, so 
    that is good. Want to revisit a time for a chat? My schedule is now 
    much more free, thanks to these BRAIN initiative activities 
    launching... 
    Best, 
    Ed
