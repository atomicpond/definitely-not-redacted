    Hi, Michael. 
    I'm writing about the Jane Doe case in SDNY involving Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein. Can I talk to you briefly? Story is likely 
    going online in the next couple hours. Apologies for the short notice. I wanted to get a comment on behalf of Mr. Epstein. 
    Thanks and best, 
    Joe
