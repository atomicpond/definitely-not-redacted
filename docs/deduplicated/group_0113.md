    Steve Bannon's clever idea to save the GOP from brutal midterms 
    By Fareed Zakaria, Friday, June 1, 2018 
    ROME -- The Republican Party faces dim prospects in the midterm elections. But it doesn't have to be that way, says 
    Stephen K. Bannon, the chief ideologist of the populist wave that brought Donald Trump into the White House. "If the 
    Republicans continue on the path they are on," Bannon told me Thursday, "they will lose 40 seats in the House and 
    President Trump will be impeached." He presented an alternative that strikes me as clever, and it's a strategy that 
    Trump himself seems to instinctively get. 
    Bannon was in Rome to learn from and provide support to the unusual coalition of populists and nationalists who 
    together won half the vote in Italy's recent elections and are now set to govern. Bannon sees that sort of coalition — 
    mixing left and right, old and young — as his goal for the United States. "Europe is about a year ahead of the United 
    States.... You see populist-nationalist movements with reform [here].... You could begin to see the elements of 
    Bernie Sanders coupled with the Trump movement that really becomes a dominant political force in American politics." 
    (This column draws on an on-air interview he did with me for CNN, as well as a subsequent conversation.) 
    The Republican Party's strategy, for now, appears to be to make the midterm elections a series of local contests focusing 
    on the tax cut and the healthy economy. Bannon views this as fundamentally misguided. "
