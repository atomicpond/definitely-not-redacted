    Omar Quadhafi is hunkering down in Tripoli giving press interviews denying that rebels are taking over 
    Eastern Libya. Oil prices are shooting over one hundred dollars a barrel. The US government is on the 
    verge of a shut down. These are not the top secret opening lines to Aaron Sorkin's new script, but the 
    global headlines of a world spinning out of control. I head to Los Angeles like an overdressed lemming to 
    attend the 83rd Academy Awards and attempt to make sense of artists thrust into combat. 
    For the second year nearly 6,000 Academy members have nominated 10 films and the battle is down to two. 
    The beloved timeless classic, "The King's Speech" marches into the arena as the front runner, but 
    passionate supporters of the brilliant edgier (and critics darling) "The Social Network" have not 
    conceded. The ballots are counted, the party invites are out and still the feelings are raw. Filmmakers 
    are exhausted from campaigning. 
    At Bryan Lourd's famous star studded party Sony Classics' Co-President Michael Barker announces to me he 
    has taken a random sampling of voters in the room. He says, "There will be a 'Social Network' upset at 
    the Kodak Theater." Shear panic radiates from my every pore as he says, "I am joking." It's like color 
    war at summer camp. 
    Woody Allen and George Lucas tell me they are no longer members of the Academy because pitting artists 
    against each other to determine the quality of their work is insane. They are right. 
    My event and publicity company is considered "Switzerland" by the studios, as we help every filmmaker to 
    present and position his work. This year I am somewhat emotionally sucked in.
