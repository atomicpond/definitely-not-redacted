    Subject: Reminder: AICE Update: Did the British promise the Arabs independence in Palestine? 
    HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032012 
    Did the British promise the Arabs independence in 
    Palestine? 
    In July 1915, Hussein ibn 'Ali, the Sherif of 
    Mecca, sent a letter to Sir Henry MacMahon, 
    the High Commissioner for Egypt, informing 
    him of the terms for Arab participation in the 
    war against the Turks. The letters between 
    Hussein and Mac-Mahon that followed outlined 
    the areas that Britain was prepared to cede to 
    the Arabs in exchange for their help.

    Trump's Saudi Arms Sale Is About Politics and 
    Economics, Not Security 
    by Mitchell Bard 
    President Trump wants to use his emergency 
    powers to sell billions of dollars' worth of 
    weapons to Saudi Arabia on national security 
    grounds. Congress wants to stop the sale 
    because of lingering anger over Saudi abuses 
    and the murder of journalist Jamal 
    Khashoggi, and the usurpation of its legal 
    authority to review arms sales. Both sides are 
    ingenuous. The willingness to sell the Saudis - 
    weapons has little to do with American national security, and 
    everything to do with economics and politics.

    The U.S.-Israel relationship is based on the twin pillars of shared 
    values and mutual interests. Given this commonality of interests and 
    beliefs, it should not be surprising that support for Israel is one of the 
    most pronounced and consistent foreign policy values of the American 
    people. 
    Today's interdependent global economy requires that trade policy be 
    developed at the national and state level. Many states have
