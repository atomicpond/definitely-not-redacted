    My initial recommendation this morning was to buy the $200 Aug puts. I still think that is the best idea. The 
    stock is now down 16% on a deal that no one fully understands. The CEO has a good track record regarding 
    mergers. So I think it makes sense to keep the stock and own protection for the next 35 days until we 
    hopefully get more clarity from management.

    Importance: High 
    We own 8000 shares on the thesis that their growing exposure to data center capex spend would be a big positive for 
    the stock. 
    Recommendation: Keep the stock and buy Aug $200 puts on the 8000 shares costing $6.50 or $52,000. Nothing has 
    changed regarding their core business. Data center spending is not going to change based off this M&A transaction. 
    However if I am wrong and the market further penalizes the stock at least our losses are contained. The stock has 
    dropped $40 and I think we could easily recoup our premium if the market buys into the CEO's reason for the merger. 
    If I never had a position I would absolutely buy the stock using options. I would be selling October $185 puts and buying 
    Oct $220 calls costing 50c/share.

    Re Broadcom: the stock is up $1.20 at $211.50. After the initial shock reaction of yesterday, there has been a lot of 
    focus on the cost synergies etc. but very little conviction in revenue opportunities. However until we hear from 
    management as to the overall intentions of the deal, uncertainty will linger. 
    This morning the pricing is as follows: 
    Aug 200 Puts cost $4.10 
    Sept 200 Puts cost $7.90 
    Earning are on 08/30. So worst case is the uncertainty lingers until then which would argue to buy the Sept puts.
