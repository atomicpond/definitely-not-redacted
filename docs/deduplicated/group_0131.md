    Importance: High 
    Dear Jeffrey, 
    Recently while refurbishing Donald Trump's 757 I worked closely with his Director of Business Development / 
    Special Counsel, Michael Boccio. 
    Although I have worked with some very intelligent and creative individuals, Michael is a real stand out — he is 
    impressive on many levels. 
    Someone (or organization) is going to be excited to have someone with Michael's capabilities working for them 
    and thought that you may need someone like Michael on your team or have a friend who may be in search of a 
    dynamic individual with his background and talent. 
    Please take a moment to read the attached documents to see if Michael is someone you are looking for. If not, 
    I ask that you forward this e-mail to someone you believe would greatly benefit by having Michael work for 
    them. 
    I know that I always appreciate when a friend refers someone who can be of great help to me — personally or in 
    business. 
    If you have any questions about working with Michael, please do not hesitate to call me. 
    Thank you.
