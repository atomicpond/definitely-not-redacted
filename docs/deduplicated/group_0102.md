    It's Thursday morning on Wilshire Boulevard and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has just 
    opened it's doors for ticket pick-up for the 85th Oscar telecast. 
    Forty voting members, the distinguished director Norman Jewison and I are on a long single file line that 
    snakes thru the lobby patiently waiting to go upstairs to pick up our tickets. My seats were awarded via 
    a lottery system. We clutch our photo I.D. 
    Suddenly, a messenger slips in wearing a smart khaki windbreaker and cuts through the line. He announces 
    to the uniformed guard in a stage whisper, "Dreamworks", and as if Steven Spielberg himself had just 
    delivered the Gettysburg address, is ushered upstairs. 
    That is the final act of social justice of the "Lincoln" campaign. 
    I am sleep deprived and jet lagged having just spent six hours on a flight sitting next Paula Wagner who 
    is Tom Cruise's ex-agent turned Broadway producer for Jessica Chastain's "The Heiress". We discuss 
    Jessica's not so great chances to beat Jennifer Lawrence for Best Actress. I mention Harvey Weinstein's 
    concern about Emmanuel Riva's last minute surge. The French phenomena doesn't speak English, has never 
    been to L.A. and it's like voting for a ghost, even on her 86th birthday. 
    This is the year I got phone calls in September from top studio executives announcing each are winning 
    the Oscar. Their euphoric giddiness is due to the quality of the films resulting in the priciest oscar 
    campaigns
