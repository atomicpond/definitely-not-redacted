    Hi Lawrence, 
    just back from a long tour ,,on origins". 
    As promised you will get my message promptly. 
    As you may understand, before we start recruiting for the Festival our budget 
    implies more freedom. Now I simply do not have the flexibility to decide so easily 
    on amounts in „kilos". (especially as a prominent Nobel laureate shortly before 
    deadline agreed to come and implied a pretty large sum). 
    What I can offer you is 5k as a lump sum. This is the ultimate at the moment. 
    I deeply regret these limitations but I cannot ignore redlines. 
    So please let me know if you can or cannot come. 
    As ever Jakob
