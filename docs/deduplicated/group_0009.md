    Dear Sirs: 
    We are preparing an article about the calendaring today of Mr Edwards' claim against Mr Epstein for jury trial 
    and the witness list which names________________and other young women who allege they were underage 
    victims of Mr Epstein. 
    Mr Edwards claims that Mr Epstein maliciously attempted to intimidate him and his clients into retracting their 
    claims. 
    Ms further has stated to us that she intends to testify that she was flown to London by Mr Epstein and 
    instructed to have sex at age 17 with Prince Andrew. She alleges that she was paid $15k for this encounter. 
    She claims that on another occasion, Mr Epstein flew two young women to a dinner for the purpose of 
    entertaining President Clinton. She claims she herself was sex trafficked to several other men, whose contact 
    information is contained in an address book of Mr Epstein's filed in court records. 
    HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030620 
    May we have a comment please? Our deadline is 1pm tomorrow (SATURDAY) ET.
