    Fareed Zakaria: Trump sells America short 
    Dear Donald Trump: China, Japan and Mexico are not "killing us" 
    By Fareed Zakaria, Thursday, September 17, 2015 
    Donald Trump's presidential bid is centered on the promise of his personal talents. He says he's the "most successful 
    person ever to run for the presidency, by far." (George Washington and Dwight Eisenhower, sit down!) But if there is an 
    idea animating his candidacy, it is that the United States is being badly beaten by its economic competitors. In his speech 
    on foreign policy this week, Trump explained that America is being bested by countries such as China, Japan and Mexico 
    because their leaders are "smarter, more cunning and sharper than our leaders." "They're killing us," he often says. 
    This is an odd moment to make these charges because the reality is almost entirely the opposite. The United States is 
    more dominant on the global economic landscape than at any point since the heyday of Bill Clinton's presidency — 
    perhaps even more so. 
    Last quarter, the U.S. economy grew at a 3.7 percent clip. Annual growth now is almost twice that of Europe and four 
    times that of Japan. Unemployment is at 5.1 percent, the lowest in seven years. The deficit as a percentage of gross 
    domestic product (2.8 percent in 2014) is at its lowest since 2007. 
    "The U.S. has come out of the 2008 crisis better than all the others," says Ruchir Sharma, head of global macro investing 
    at Morgan Stanley. "Americans have reduced their debt burden more than the Europeans, while China's debt has 
    skyrocketed to extremely dangerous levels. If you look outside of China, U.S. growth is actually faster even than the 
    emerging markets. Since the 2008 crisis, U.S. equity markets have outperformed all others — in fact 9 out of the 10 most 
    valuable companies in the world are
