    Steve Bannon trying to get on disgraced 
    Jeffrey Epstein's good side 
    By Emily Smith 
    Steve Bannon shared a secret meeting with reviled billionaire pedophile Jeffrey -Epstein 
    at the financier's notorious Upper East Side mansion. 
    Former White House chief strategist Bannon was spotted stepping out of his SUV and 
    entering the registered sex offender's sprawling 21,000-square-foot mansion at 9 E. 71st 
    St. shortly before 7 a.m. Wednesday. 
    Epstein's -palatial pad is one of his homes where young_girls were allegedly brought in to 
    perform massages and used as "sex slaves." 
    We assume Bannon wasn't there for a massage. 
    Sources speculate that the disgraced -Epstein wants to use his millions to work his way 
    close to political power again. 
    HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026314 
    One told us, "Bannon needs money to bankroll his political agenda. Epstein has plenty of 
    money, and craves power and access." 
    Bannon made an early-morning beeline to Epstein, even though Bannon may have 
    burned bridges when he savaged Ivanka Trump over her criticism of Roy Moore, whom 
    Bannon backed despite claims the candidate had sexually harassed teens. Citing an 
    allegation in -legal papers from a woman (who later dropped her lawsuit) that Donald 
    Trump and Epstein had raped her when she was 13, Bannon said in response to Ivanka, 
    "What about the allegations about her dad and that 13-year-old?"
