    Alex Acosta update 
    Earlier this week, pedophile Jeffrey Epstein bought his way out of a lawsuit that would 
    have given some of his victims the opportunity to testify about his predatory and criminal 
    conduct. Victims never got that opportunity when Epstein faced criminal charges, because 
    Alex Acosta___then the lead prosecutor, now the Secretary of Labor___let Epstein off with 
    a ridiculously lenient sentence. Despite having committed hideous sex offenses with dozens 
    of minors, Epstein received a sentence of 13 months in jail, during which he was often free 
    during the day. 
    Epstein's decision to buy his out of the civil lawsuit, one that he had the nerve to initiate, 
    benefits Acosta. The trial would have provided non-stop headlines, coupled with frequent 
    references to the sweetheart deal Acosta gave him. As Randy Schultz puts it, the trial would 
    have been the occasion for a long overdue public shaming of Acosta. Now, he avoids this 
    consequence. 
    But this doesn't mean Acosta is out of the woods. He faces calls for his ouster from the 
    Trump cabinet. 
    Some calls are from the usual suspects. Michelle Goldberg of the New York Times has 
    written a piece so obnoxious that it almost makes me want to see Acosta ride out the storm. 
    But some conservatives are also advocating Acosta's departure. Concerned Women for 
    America is a stalwart conservative organization. It describes itself, accurately, as "focus[ed]
