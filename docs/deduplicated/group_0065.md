    Books and newspaper accounts of Trump's 45 years in business were full of his 
    shady dealings, and the presidency had only helped to highlight them and to surface even 
    juicier ones. Real estate was the world's favorite money laundering currency and Trump's 
    perceived A -level real estate business was quite explicitly designed to appeal to money 
    launderers. What's more, Trump's own financial woes, and desperate efforts to maintain 
    billionaire lifestyle, cache, and market viability, forced him into constant and unsubtle 
    schemes. Practically speaking, you couldn't miss him, as the Mueller investigation 
    appeared to be finding. 
    In November 2004, for instance, Jeffrey Epstein, the financier later caught in a scandal 
    involving under-age prostitutes, agreed to buy out of bankruptcy a house in Palm Beach, 
    Florida for $36 million—a house that had been on the market for two years. Epstein and 
    Trump had been close friends—playboys in arms, as it were—for more than a decade, 
    with Trump always hopeful that Epstein would provide some of his financial expertise to 
    enabvle h8im to survive. Trump was beholden to Deutsch Bank and was on the hook 
    personally for 40 million dollars. 
    Epstein took Trump to see the Palm Beach house to advise him on construction issues 
    involved with moving the swimming pool. As he prepared to finalize his deal for the 
    house, an incredulous Epstein saw a severely cash-constrained Trump bid $41 million for 
    the property, buying it through an entity named Trump Properties LLC, ultimate owner 
    unknown.. Trump, Epstein knew, had been in the buisness of leasing his name. Hotels are 
    actually owned by others but renting the trump name would cost a percent or two. ,
