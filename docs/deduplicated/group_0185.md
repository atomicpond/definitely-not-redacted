    He is digging around again -- not clear if its another book/or expanded paperback version. Was 
    asking me all sorts of questions about why you hired Ken Starr. I told him I had no idea -- I think he 
    is doing some Trump-related digging too. 
    Anyway, for what its worth...

    Trying to get you in with Masa crowd. Some resistance though, due to all the headlines/controversy - 
    - as you might expect. I tell them about your relationship with Saudis/Gates/Trump crowd, but still 
    doubts. Working on it!
