    Re: Good Morning America and Night Line interview with Jane Doe 3 
    Dear Mr. Zucker: 
    I represent Jeffrey Epstein. I have been informed by Producer James Hill that ABC 
    intends to air an interview, conducted by a Good Morning America co-host, of a woman known 
    in court papers as Jane Doe 3.1 I write to put you on notice that ABC's publication of Jane Doe 
    3's accusations is grossly negligent or worse. The accusations, many of which relate to my 
    client, relate to alleged conduct that occurred approximately 15 years ago. The current 
    accusations are simply reformatted and embellished echoes of previous allegations, which were 
    first made by Jane Doe 3 to tabloid publications in the United Kingdom in 2011 and which have 
    no independent news value. These allegations were then and remain now uncorroborated and 
    have been refuted or undermined by other, credible evidence. Indeed, a federal judge recently 
    refused to consider these allegations in pending litigation, finding them "immaterial and 
    impertinent", while striking the allegations and denying Jane Doe 3s Motion to Join, See Jane 
    Doe 1 and 2 v. United States, 08-CV-80736-KAM (S.D. Fla.), Dkt 324 at 5. In addition, in that 
    very same litigation, Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Timothy R. Slater filed a 
    declaration stating that when Jane Doe 3 was interviewed by the FBI in 2007 she refused to 
    cooperate with the investigation of Mr. Epstein declaring she wanted nothing to do with the 
    matter. For ABC to air these untested allegations on national television as "news" when Jane 
    Doe 3 intentionally declined eight years ago to subject these same allegations to verification by 
    the FBI would be grossly irresponsible and
