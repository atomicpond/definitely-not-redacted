    Dear Mr. Lefkowitz, 
    >, Martin Weinberg 
    Here are the questions I'd like to ask Jeffrey Epstein. Would he be available to answer any of these on the phone 
    or by email? People have told me some of his thoughts on background but I wanted to see if he could tell me or 
    email me anything directly I could use on the record. Also I'd like to run the information I already have by you 
    or him. 
    Thank you, 
    Alexandra

    Could he talk about his interest in science and the 2011 grants/conference? 
    -How has his business been affected? Is there any new direction he's taking it? Does he still have the same 
    clients or new ones? Is it still at $15 billion?

    Alexandra, 
    I have not been able to respond to your questions because Mr. Epstein is traveling. 
    But if you plan to make any factual assertions about him in your article, I hope you will run the facts 
    by me, as you said yesterday you would do. 
    Mr. Epstein has been the subject of many inaccurate and misleading articles, and I am sure Newsweek would 
    not want to make such a mistake or worse, libel him. 
    Best, 
    Jay
