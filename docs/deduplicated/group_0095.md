    Is UNRWA vital for the Palestinians' future? 
    A great international hue and cry followed the 
    Trump administration's announcement the U.S. 
    would no longer fund the UN Relief and Works  
    Agency (UNWRA) because it is an

    How Obama Blew the Chance for Economic Peace 
    by Mitchell Bard 
    Iln 2009, Barack Obama had an 
    unprecedented opportunity to advance the 
    peace process between Israel and the

    because he did not come from the same 
    terrorist background as Yasser Arafat and

    comrades who insisted on "liberating Palestine," Salam Fayyad, was 
    interested in building the infrastructure for a future state, 
    strengthening the West Bank economy, and improving the lives of the 
    Palestinian people.
