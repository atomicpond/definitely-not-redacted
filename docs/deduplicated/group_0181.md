    Thanks.. I need to get this or something to them quickly. I do feel the need to respond to each of their claims 
    otherwise they would say I don't deny them.. Will include a short preamble. I am going to cc the letter to the 
    Buzzfeed lawyers. I figure I will see whether the buzzfeed story gets any traction at all, or appears before 
    putting on my web site, or tweeting and facebooking it.

    site? . that goes into more details but in general , these are false. they were either investigated and found 
    lacking or ignored. etc. often they throw out the near publishing date merely to get you to ansser.

    I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your email. While I am running the risk that you will report my comments, if you do, either 
    out of context, or incompletely, I am responding with an effort to be complete. It is hard to know how to respond to a list of false 
    and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading statements on your part. I treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard 
    to support and mentor students, colleagues, and members of the general public. I do not sexually harass people. If
