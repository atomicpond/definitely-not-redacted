    Subject: could you put something like this out. if you want 
    I have to hand it to ms . I'm sure she deserves the pretty penny she has made for her effort. She has 
    certainly caught the imagination of a public hungry for salacious fiction. To suggest her story is anything other 
    than that, a fiction, is ludicrous. Presidents at dinner on caribean islands. ( clinton was never ever there, easy 
    to confirm ). Sharing a bath with a Prince ( bathtub too small even for one adult ). sex slave being paid 
    thousands of dollars. ( while at the exact same time, she was working as a hostess in a burger bar ). being 
    lent out to a prime minister though this prime mininster, never out of sight of his massive security detail also 
    never visited the island„ sex on a small airplane with a famous lawyer while the other passengers must have 
    been all looking out the window during the event . I would have thought that her fabrications were readilly 
    apparent , but now , being asked to deny what the press has termed her" allegations" is frankly silly. ok, to 
    play along I deny each and every allegation. The only person she didn't suggest she was forced to have sex 
    with , was Bilbo Baggins. , maybe its in the sequel.
