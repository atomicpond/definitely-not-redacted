    I don't feel I have enough information on this. I don't know who is this funds manager. They always want the

    large amount here when we don't have a credit rating and public debt is so high. I feel very uncomfortable 
    about this. 
    What do you think I should do. I am very uncomfortable. In addition to the finance minister, a leading 
    politician and leader of the coalition parliamentary group is behind it. He could be my leading contender for 
    presidency. 
    Does this sound all ridiculous to you. I have a strange feeling about this whole thing.

    Howard: 
    We're working on a story for our Sunday column about Jeffrey Epstein. I thought I might send 
    my questions to you tonight, so you'd have them first thing tomorrow. 
    HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031005 
    Would you like to comment on the following: 
    1. You've said that the women pressing suits against Mr. Epstein "have lied repeatedly, and in 
    no way shape or form were they victims. They were at his place freely and voluntarily. And one 
    of them showed Epstein a fake ID." What do you have to say now that Mr. Epstein has 
    admitted in his federal plea bargain that he did conspire to entice minors to engage in 
    prostitution? Accepting that these women came voluntarily, isn't Mr Epstein still guilty of 
    statutory rape? 
    2. Brad Edwards, an attorney who represents three of the women, recently served a 
    Subpoena to Testify at a Deposition on Epstein's former girlfriend, Ghislaine 
    Maxwell. The Subpoena asks that Maxwell produce "a list of all girls" that visited 
    Jeffrey Epstein's home
