    Subject: US Saudi Arms deal but Note Blackstone Infrastructure Fund with SAMA 
    Terje, the attached article appeared in todays FT, I have removed the defence part related to the US$110bn arms 
    deal but highlighted the separate deal done with Blackstone to establish a fund for US infrastructure this is akin 
    / precedent to what we seek to achieve with SAMA focused on global investment fund in Airport Infrastructure 
    — Best Richard. 
    US President Donald Trump began his first foreign trip with a stop in Saudi Arabia, where a $nobn 
    arms package was announced that the White House hopes will help Saudi Arabia and other gulf states 
    combat terrorism in the region and ward off threats from Iran. 
    US defence companies lifted by Saudi deals 
    Lockheed Martin and Boeing stand out after Saudi Arabia signs a 
    flurry of deals 
    Separately, the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund has also  
    announced a large investment in US infrastructure 
    through a new Blackstone fund. The sovereign Public 
    Investment Fund intends to invest $2obn into 
    Blackstone's new vehicle, with a further $2obn coming 
    from other investors. The group's stock price rose 6.7 per 
    cent to $31.88.
