    Honorable Mark Filip 
    Office of the Deputy Attorney General

    In his confirmation hearings last fall, Judge Mukasey admirably lifted up the finest 
    traditions of the Department of Justice in assuring the United States Senate, and the American 
    people, of his solemn intent to ensure fairness and integrity in the administration of justice. Your 
    own confirmation hearings echoed that bedrock determination to assure that the Department 
    conduct itself with honor and integrity, especially in the enforcement of federal criminal law. 
    We come to you in that spirit and respectfully ask for a review of the federal involvement 
    in a quintessentially state matter involving our client, Jeffrey Epstein. While we are well aware 
    of the rare instances in which a review of this sort is justified, we are confident that the 
    circumstances at issue warrant such an examination. Based on our collective experiences, as 
    well as those of other former senior Justice Department officials whose advice we have sought, 
    we have never before seen a case more appropriate for oversight and review. Thus, while neither 
    of us has previously made such a request, we do so now in the recognition that both the 
    Department's reputation, as well as the due process rights of our client, are at issue. 
    Recently, the Criminal Division concluded a very limited review of this matter at the 
    request of U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta. Critically, however, this review deliberately excluded 
    many important aspects of this case. Just this past Friday, on May 16, 2008, we received a letter 
    from the head of CEOS informing us that CEOS had conducted a review of this case. By i
