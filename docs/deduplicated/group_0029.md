    I am writing in an attempt to make contact with Jeffrey Epstein and wondered if you would, as his attorney, forward this message on 
    to him? 
    We are keen to explore the possibility of conducting an interview with Mr Epstein, on the subject of the stories which are circulating, 
    however inaccurately, about both him and Prince Andrew, the Duke of York; we'd be keen to hear from Mr Epstein first hand so that 
    the various and at times, speculative reporting which is at large in the UK press can be better scrutinised? 
    Let me tell you a bit about the Today programme. 
    Today is the BBC's main morning news show; we have been part of the BBC for over 50 years and are generally considered one of the 
    most important news broadcast outlets - either on radio or TV - here in the UK. We set the news agenda for the BBC and in many 
    respects we set the daily news agenda for the country. Our interviews are regularly re broadcast across the BBC's national and 
    international news network including - BBC World, BBC World Service and BBC Online. The combination of these outlets means 
    the global 'reach of a BBC Today programme interview is second to none. 
    Programme guests have included a selection of some of the biggest names in politics, business, international relations and the arts 
    including US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, President Nicholas Sarkozy, President Hamid Karzai, HRH the Prince of Wales, 
    former President Musharraf, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, former President Bill Clinton, Senator George Mitchell, Al
