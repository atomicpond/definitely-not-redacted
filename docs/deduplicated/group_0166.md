    I am glad to see you managed to find a way to improve your reputation in the press. Your concern and charitable

    You forgot about everyone else your actions affected and the promises you made to fix it, but you clearly make an 
    effort to improve your own image with contributions you can parade in the press. Congratulations. 
    I suppose the few people who actually cared enough to put their lives and reputation on the line for you can fend for 
    themselves. I will never understand your priorities... 
    Have a nice trip.
