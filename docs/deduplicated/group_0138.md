    Warning: The Smart Money 
    Is Fleeing U.S. Stocks 
    BY BILL BONNER, CHAIRMAN, BONNER & PARTNERS 
    DUBLIN — The Dow dropped 180 points yesterday — or 
    about 1%. 
    And another clever billionaire says he is looking elsewhere 
    for profits. Reuters: 
    Activist investor Carl Icahn on Monday said there was a chance the stock 
    market could suffer a big decline, saying valuations are rich and earnings at 
    many companies are fueled more by low borrowing costs than management's 
    efforts to boost results. 
    "I am very cautious on equities today. This market could easily have a big 
    drop," Icahn said. 
    Yes, dear reader, the smart money is getting out of U.S. stocks. And here's our 
    old friend Rob Marstrand explaining why: 
    Right now, every measure that analyzes the S&P 500 says it's expensive. Prices 
    are high relative to earnings, net assets, sales, and cash flow.

    What's more, there's plenty of evidence that the main thing propping up the 
    stock prices is heavy buying by the companies themselves [via share 
    repurchases]. 
    And now, that prop is getting kicked out from under the stock market. 
    Bloomberg: 
    After snapping up trillions of dollars of their own stock in a five-year 
    shopping binge that dwarfed every other buyer, U.S. companies from Apple 
    Inc. to IBM Corp. just put on the brakes. 
    Announced repurchases dropped 38% to $244 billion in the last four months, 
    the biggest decline since 2009...

    Rickards: "Warning, I've Changed My Thesis On Gold" 
    I firmly believe we're at the beginning of the BIGGEST move the world 
    has ever seen in gold. "Simple math" says $10,000 gold is all but certain. But, you're 
    not going to believe what I have to say next... BEFORE you buy a single ounce of 
    gold, read this important message.
