    In fact the increase in the diversity of candidates under RCV is related to turn-out. If RCV had been used in 2016, Bernie 
    Sanders could have run as an independent in the general election without fear of guaranteeing a Trump victory. Many 
    of the Bernie supporters who stayed home on election day might then have voted---and presumably would have ranked 
    Clinton second. This would have given her a victory over Trump in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania (and possibly 
    elsewhere).
