    The nice thing about these tickets is that they are the most VIP. It includes reception, dinner, gala and after all

    I have the same ones (through Bill). 
    I also got two additional for you but it turns out that they are not the same level so I reached to Kevin for help. 
    The price is 2,500Euro per ticket (this is very reduced price as I think the regular one for this is 15K and it is 
    hard to get it). They will need an email from someone from your office and name a your guest asap.
