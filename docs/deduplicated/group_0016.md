    R REPRINT OF THIS STORY 
    Just days before a Friday deadline, the Justice Department has reassigned the Jeffrey Epstein victims' rights 
    case to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Atlanta, the attorneys representing Epstein's victims' attorneys said 
    Tuesday. 
    Miami federal prosecutors, in letter to attorneys for the victims's lawyers on Monday, said they had recused 
    themselves from the case, according to Brad Edwards and Jack Scarola, representing Epstein's victims. 
    HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031388 
    The reassignment means that the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, Byung J. "BJay" Pak, will 
    oversee the case for the government. Pak, a former Georgia lawmaker, was appointed Atlanta's chief federal 
    prosecutor by President Trump in October 2017. 
    The Justice Department is still under a Friday deadline for prosecutors to confer with the victims' attorneys in 
    an effort to settle the case. On Feb. 22, U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra in Palm Beach ruled that federal 
    prosecutors, under former Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, broke the law when they concealed a plea 
    agreement from more than 30 underage girls in Palm Beach who
