    Bill Gates is the most admired person in the world. 
    according to a global survey for The Times by YouGov. The man who many 
    see as responsible for the democratisation of computing and who is the biggest activist philanthropist across the globe is 
    highly regarded everywhere. 
    In his home, America, he ranks only 5th, behind Pope Francis, President Obama, Billy Graham, and George W. Bush. Mr 
    Obama and the Pope have a strong lead in Western nations but Mr Gates is highly regarded in every country polled, from 
    Brazil to Egypt, Nigeria to Indonesia, Britain to Russia to Australia. He tops the poll in China — as respondents there said: "He 
    got into a good university, but gave up studying to start his business. He has become a rich man despite dropping out of school 
    ... He has a successful career and a caring heart — he is ordinary, but great." 
    The Queen came highest in Britain and second in Australia, but didn't make the Indian top ten. Nevertheless she is the most 
    admired woman in the world, in 17th place, closely followed by Angelina Jolie and Oprah Winfrey. 
    Half of the top ten admired in Russia are women, including the pop singer Alla Pugacheva and the Queen. That is the highest 
    figure in all countries surveyed — women are strikingly under-represented. 
    Some light is shed on this by comparing our results with a recent Gallup poll in America, which asked for most admired man 
    and woman in separate questions. In that poll, Bill Clinton scored 2 per cent and Hillary Clinton 15. YouGov asked a single 
    question, not differentiating men and women, and the two Clintons rated about the same. The two polls also show the power of 
    the media to direct public attention: Gallup polled early in Dec
