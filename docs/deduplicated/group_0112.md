    Peg --
    Obviously, I'm sharing what follows on the assumption that everything here is just between us. 
    The thesis of the Times piece is that the rich and their corporations have SO much power 
    that we no longer live in a democracy. 
    Can "we the people" make change? Not really. 
    Who can? The rich and powerful. 
    Huh? All they want is the status quo. Or more. 
    But they could --- okay, its not likely, but they could --- turn on the bad actors at their social/economic level. 
    For example: Wall Street CEOs, donors to the Tea Party, etc. 
    That's the topic. Shaming. Shunning. 
    One of the people I deal with --- there are several others. --- is Jeffrey Epstein. 
    Reading the clips, I don't see that Jeffrey as been shunned.
