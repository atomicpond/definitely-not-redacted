    A friendly discussion about Syria with a former US State Department colleague gave rise to a point I 
    will not soon forget. "Fred, there's no time for policy deliberations about Syria or anyplace else. We 
    live in the era of Blackberry diplomacy. We react and we improvise as best we can." 
    Anyone under the age of thirty reading the above would probably think, "Why in the world is the US 
    government using the Blackberry?" Those who turned thirty long before the end of the last century—
    even those of us who try seriously not to be technological Luddites—wonder sometimes if the 
    communications revolution and the 24/7 news cycle it has spawned will end up doing more harm than 
    good to the progress of civilization and well-being of the republic. 
    Those who have had the privilege and burden of working in the US national security establishment 
    are well-acquainted with how hard it is to find time to think. This was true long before the advent of 
    email and other forms of electronic communication. Although there may have been times when
