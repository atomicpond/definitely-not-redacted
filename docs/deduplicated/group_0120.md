    WITH his panoramic view of world affairs sharper than ever, Paul Keating blames the current global crisis 
    on blunders by European and US leaders and warns that Australia must rediscover the keys to national 
    success. 
    Interviewed in his Sydney office, furnished in a style he calls "the last gasp of revolutionary classicism", Keating's 
    new 600-plus page book sits atop his desk, an insight into his intellectual, aesthetic and political obsessions. 
    What has Keating been doing since he left office in 1996? He has been travelling, speaking and analysing the world 
    and Australia with undiminished intensity suggesting a man operating as prime minister-in-exile. 
    His idea of leadership is more philosophical than ever, more distant from Bob Hawke or John Howard. His focus is 
    the synthesis between beauty and reason and his book encompasses China's currency, the world malaise, Mahler's 
    Symphony No2 and breaking the republic with the Queen.
