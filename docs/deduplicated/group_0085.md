    Camp Hits Carried Interest in Tax Plan With Wall Street in Focus 
    Posted February 25, 2014, 10:29 P.M. ET 
    The top Republican tax writer in Congress will lean on the financial industry with his planned revamp of the U.S. code, 
    changing the treatment of carried interest and imposing a levy on the assets of banks and insurers. 
    House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) is to unveil the proposed tax code changes Feb. 
    26 that also include revisions that affect how investment fund managers' compensation is taxed. He offered a preview 
    tonight using rhetoric that in part echoes President Barack Obama's own calls to change tax laws.
