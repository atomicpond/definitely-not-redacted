    Conshita is very media savy, as you are probably well aware. She knows exactly what we are doing, and is taking her 
    own counter-measures, but it is constant wack-a-mole with her.

    Jeffrey, 
    The bats did the sweep. Here are the new results taken as of a minute ago. 
    You have only one negative article left on front page of google, which is 
    the Huffington Post article. The Huffington Post is extremely hard to 
    move, because it is so powerful, has millions of links to it, and uploads 
    massive new and original content it on a daily basis with posting from out 
    side readers. We managed to push it down the page, as it used to be at the 
    top. If we were able to post original content to both the science and the 
    org site (absolutely not a single word to this day by Jessica, just talk), 
    we would have been able to push it down even further, and off the page. WE 
    did manage to get rid of the daily beast article, which is now far 
    removed, inspite of their own efforts to keep it prominent. 
    Toxic suggested search engine terms that popped up automatically when you 
    typed in your name are also now removed. 
    Wikipedia was an important victory, as it will always be at the top of the 
    search engine results. ow the head lines do not mention convicted sex 
    offender or pedophile. Instead, Philanthrophic work, Epstein Foundation, 
    Promotion of Scientists. We have stopped the hacking on your wiki site, 
    and that was a major effor. Your wiki entry now is pretty tame, and bad 
    stuff has been muted, bowlerized, and pused to the bottom. Careful editing 
    and wording has muted the effect immensely. We hacked the site to replace 
    the mug shot and caption, and now has an entirely different photo and 
    caption. This was a big success. 
    We pushed the Edge all the way up to the front page, where it was 
    previously buried on page 5 of google search. 
    We have promoted the other jeffrey epsteins, and other pages are also 
    filled with your material. 
    And, while the sites are up, and in the direction we hoped, they are still 
    new, and subject to volit
