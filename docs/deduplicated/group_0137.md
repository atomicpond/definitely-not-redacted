    Dear Friends, 
    PLEASE watch this very important short and incredibly clear video regarding the Iran deal. 
    If you have not yet called your congressmen and asked other friends and relatives to do so, PLEASE do that as well. The 
    wellbeing of your children and grandchildren depend upon it!

    The Iran Nuclear Deal 
    Dear Friend, 
    This week, our featured video is as urgent as it gets. Just days after President Obama and 
    Secretary of State John Kerry announced the nuclear deal with Iran, Dennis Prager was in 
    studio recording a video explaining why the deal is so dangerous, and how it parallels what 
    happened in 1938 between Great Britain and Nazi Germany. This is the fastest turn-
    around time on any video we've released in PragerU's history, but what's at stake is so 
    monumentally important, we knew we couldn't waste any time. So please take five minutes 
    to watch the video. Forward it to your family, friends, and the office
