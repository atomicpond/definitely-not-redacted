    • How to play it? We still like "appearing" call spreads on XLF 
    o Buy a 6 month 105% call with a short 110% call that knock in if XLF trades above 115% during the life of the trade 
    for 1.75% premium cost 
    • Gross max payoff if knock-in is triggered: 2.8x (5.0%/1.75%) 
    • Gross max payoff if knock-in is not trigger
