    In recent months, China's BAT collapse has demonstrated how costly the expectation of 
    invincibility can be—Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent are all down more than 24% 
    from their year-to-date closing highs. Citigroup's head of Asia strategy, Mohammed 
    Apabhai, told CNN an apt analogy about the investor sentiment that led to BAT's collapse, 
    likening "the exuberance for tech stocks to the Looney Tunes cartoons in which Wile E. 
    Coyote chases Road Runner over a cliff." Given they've more or less moved in 
    tandem for years, will FAANG follow the same path as BAT?

    The BAT collapse was triggered by subpar earnings and a shifting regulatory environment 
    in China. Facebook's miss in 2Q18—which drove a $120 billion single-day market cap 
    loss, the biggest ever for a U.S. company—showed how decisive a turn could be if more 
    U.S. tech darlings stumble this quarter.

    There are mounting fundamental reasons to question the 3Q18 earnings 
    prospects of FAANG, from the accelerating user backlash against Facebook to Apple's 
    trade war exposure to Amazon's rapidly-intensifying workforce revolt that could see the e-
    commerce giant left with no option but to raise wages and improve workplace conditions 
    for its warehouse and Whole Foods employees.
