    Related Companies affiliate bids $32M for 
    embattled Palm House Hotel 
    The New York company, led by Stephen Ross, made a stalking horse bid for the Palm

    Palm House Hotel, Related Companies Stephen Ross600 
    An affiliate of the Related Companies has emerged as the initial bidder for 
    the Palm House Hotel as the failed condo-hotel project heads to a 
    bankruptcy auction. 
    The stalking horse bidder, RREF II PALM HOUSE LLC, has the same 
    address as Related Companies in New York and is led by Related 
    Companies Managing Principal Justin Metz, according to a filing in U.S. 
    Bankruptcy Court. The company is offering $32 million for the property, 
    which will set the floor price for a bankruptcy auction scheduled for next 
    month. Bids at the auction will start at $32.5 million. 
    The 79-unit condo-hotel project on Palm Beach Island stalled in 2014 and 
    its former developer now faces allegations of fraud by the Securities and 
    Exchange Commission and a group of EB-5 investors. In August, the 
    property filed for bankruptcy under its court appointed receiver with 
    creditors claims totaling $115 million. 
    Cushman & Wakefield's Robert Given, Errol Blumer, Michael Mulkern and 
    Robert Kaplan are the exclusive marketing advisers for the property. The 
    auction is scheduled for 10 a.m. on November 16, 2018 in West Palm 
    Beach. 
    Given said he expects the property to sell for up to $40 million and it could 
    be the last opportunity for a developer to own a hotel in the wealthy enclave 
    of Palm Beach. He said the next owner will likely not redevelop the

    property. Instead, the best option would be to continue r

He said the next owner will likely not redevelop the property. Instead, the best option would be to continue renovating the existing project which could take more than a year to complete, Given said.
    
    By auctioning the project through a bankruptcy sale, it will be offered free and clear from any liens. The bankruptcy also means that the new owner will not have any responsibility for the issues stemming from EB-5 investors who had invested in the property.
    
    The 82,648-square-foot project was first developed in 1961 and expanded in 1981. The property was set to be renovated by a group led by developer Rob
