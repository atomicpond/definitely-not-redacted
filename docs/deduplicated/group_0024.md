    Importance: High 
    Paul Rampell does act as Donald Trump's attorney for some personal, real estate and Town of PB matters. James Green 
    of WPB also does work for Trump (like the American flag matter) usually through Rampell. I think another firm was doing 
    the airport flight path and expansion matter.

    Do you know Debbie Bancroft? Why is she giving quotes about you? She is a fat drunk with no money and a bad marriage. She 
    writes or did write a pathetic social column about losers. Did you ever meet her? She is a joke.
