    Topic: The quixotic search for energy solutions
    Another Don Quixote Thanksgiving. Every year at Thanksgiving 1 , we look in-depth at an issue that affects markets and
    portfolios. Last year, we examined the unraveling situation in Europe. Unfortunately, most concerns we expressed last year
    have been borne out, and are getting much worse (I spent the weekend reading legal documents on a Eurozone break-up, just in
    case). Like Don Quixote, Europe went on its journey for all the wrong reasons, adopting a half-pregnant monetary union to
    support a political objective that had arguably already been achieved by 1955 2 . This year, a look at something just as worrying
    in the long run as the fiscal problems of the West: the search for energy solutions. This journey has been fraught with
    similarly quixotic dead ends, fairy tales and blunders ignoring economic (and thermodynamic) realities. This is important to us,
    since energy cost and availability is central to how we think about growth, profits, stability and our portfolio investments.
    As part of this effort, I made a pilgrimage to Manitoba to spend a day with Vaclav Smil. Vaclav is one of the world’s foremost
    experts on energy, and has written over 30 books and 300 papers on the subject (he’s #49 on Foreign Policy’s list of the 100
    most influential thinkers). Vaclav’s book “Energy Myths and Realities” should be required reading for politicians or regulators
    impacting energy policy. We start with an unflinching look at these realities before turning to solutions, and some potentially
    encouraging developments, which have less to do with how electricity is generated, and more to do with how it might be stored.
    “A dream is a wish your heart makes” (Cinderella)
    Over the last 50 years, a lot of proposed solutions have not panned out as expected. While the process of discovery and
    invention always includes large doses of failure, energy policy is different than say, cell phones or VCRs, since more public
    money, t

    White Castle.   Twenty five years ago, I had a friend with a peculiar way of responding to seeing things he didn’t like on TV: he would throw White Castle hamburgers at the screen.  I always thought this was a bad way to waste a good hamburger, but I had one of those moments the other night when watching news reports on debt ceiling discussions.  Media outlets have referred to President Reagan’s scolding of Congressional Republicans for delaying debt ceiling increases, and the 18 increases that took place during his Presidency.  The implication: reservations about raising the debt ceiling are as irresponsible now as they were then.  This is a disingenuous argument; in the 1980’s, the debt ceiling being debated was 50% of GDP, and had no bearing on the solvency of the United States.  Today, the proposed increase raises the debt limit twice as high, measured relative to GDP or government revenues.  While a default is a very bad idea (deserving of a White Castle hurling of its own), unconstrained debt growth with no plan to slow it is bad as well.  Some suggest we not worry about debt growth, since demand from foreign central banks and the Federal Reserve would keep yields in check.  That logic is irresponsible at best.  Debt limit legislation is a rocky but healthy way for a democracy to decide whether mega-deficits are in the long-term public interest.

    Eye on the Market, April 9, 2012 (attached pdf is easier to read this week)
    
    Topics: Q&A on the USA, with a watchful eye on the risk of giant man-eating plants; Spain
    
     
    
    Our view for 2012 was that economic and equity market conditions in the US and Asia ex-Japan would be better than in Europe.  So far, that view is on track.  Spain in particular is in difficult shape (see page 5); its banks and government may have to borrow 1.5 trillion Euros over the next 12 months while in recession.  Both the ECB and EU will need to keep the spigot open to prevent Spain from becoming a bigger problem.  This week, some Q&A on the US recovery, flows into bonds and stocks, profits and P/E multiples, municipal bonds, and the long-term US fiscal situation. 
    
     
    
    The Fed appears to be saying that no additional monetary easing is needed unless the economy worsens further.  Are there any signs that the US recovery is becoming self-reinforcing?
    
    Durable goods consumption, equipment & software spending, vehicle sales, bank loans to companies, manufacturing payrolls (even after Friday’s disappointing report) and housing stats (building permits, multifamily housing starts) have improved over the last few months.  While delinquency rates are in better shape (credit card delinquencies are back to 2007 levels), household credit growth is still weak.  However, homebuilders are seeing stronger demand, and nationwide remodeling continues to rise.  We see opportunities in retailing and building products companies that may benefit from a continuation in these trends.
    
     
    
    
    
     
    
    Has the data really been that good?  I heard better US economic data has a lot to do with the weather.
    
    Parts of the US experienced the warmest March in recorded history.  Measured from December to February, the winter was the 4th w

    Eye on the Market, February 27, 2012 [the attached PDF is much easier to read this week, particularly if you are interested in the energy science implications of last week’s press release from the House Minority Leader]
    
    Topics: oil markets and Iran
    
     
    
    Most of this week’s note deals with oil prices and Iran, but I did want to point out a trend that is illustrative of how things are going globally.  One of the strongest aspects of the US recovery has been the rebound in business spending on equipment and software.  As highlighted by our friends at Hamiltonian Associates, sales by Caterpillar’s dealer network are a proxy for global trends.  Caterpillar’s US sales are leading the pack for the first time in a while, Asia is moderating, and Europe trails with a distinctly negative trend.  We expect a recovery in US payrolls this year, and eventually, in labor incomes.  The US recovery may be weak by historical standards, but expectations are pretty low (2.2% growth in 2012).  We expect the US to exceed expectations, and for Europe ex-Germany to disappoint them.  Absent a blow-up in Iran, this view seems like it’s on track.  
    
     
    
    “Iranium enrichment”: another hurdle for global markets to surmount
    
    The near-term fundamentals don’t point to higher oil prices.  Oil demand has been revised down a bit, particularly in the OECD, and non-OPEC supply growth is a little higher in 2012 than in recent years.  After netting all the supply and demand factors, it looks like there will be a global oil inventory build in 2012 (see chart below), not something we would normally associate with rising oil prices.  However, even before we get to Iran, there are other factors contributing to higher prices: a pick-up in global growth expectations for 2013 and beyond; the explosion of Central Bank b
