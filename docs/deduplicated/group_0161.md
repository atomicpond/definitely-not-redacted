    Slowing economy could increase pressure 
    on Big Tech 
    Sara Fischer, David McCabe, Courtenay Brown5 hours ago 
    A potential recession, combined with increasing regulatory threats for some of the biggest 
    tech companies, foreshadows a difficult 2019 for Silicon Valley. 
    Why it matters: The biggest tech companies have already raked in billions of dollars in 
    profits and benefited from major tax cuts that aren't going to be repeated, so next year isn't 
    likely to be better for them financially. They've also been dogged by scandals that have left 
    many questioning their positive role in society, and if on top of that the economy starts to 
    slip, 2019 could be worse. 
    "People look for scapegoats in a bad economy. And with big tech already on its heels, a 
    downturn probably would feed arguments that the largest internet companies are too big 
    and need to be reined in." 
    — Paul Gallant, an analyst with Cowen Washington Research Group 
    Big Tech is closing out a contentious year in Washington, and potential regulation will 
    continue to haunt it well into 2019. 
    • Google CEO Sundar Pichai has agreed to testify before Congress, and will likely be 
    asked about whether the company is being transparent about its data privacy practices and 
    any potential bias. By the year's end, the CEOs of Twitter, Google and Facebook will have 
    been called to testified in front of Congress for the first time ever during 2018.
