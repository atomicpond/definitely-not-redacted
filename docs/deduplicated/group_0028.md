    take-it-or-leave-it deal by the U.S. on the 
    nuclear issue is the wrong strategy  
    Ray Takeyh 
    February 14, 2013 -- On Feb. 26, the United States and Iran will once 
    more resume their diplomatic ritual, in the so-called six-party talks, over 
    Iran's disputed nuclear program. As the two perennial adversaries eye one 
    another, there are competing paradigms about how to deal with Tehran. 
    An emerging school of thought suggests that the best means of "testing" 
    Iran is to offer it a final nuclear agreement that presumably promises 
    measurable relief from sanctions for significant Iranian concessions. Iran's 
    failure to grasp such an offer would then conclusively demonstrate to both 
    domestic and international audiences that the cause of the impasse is not 
    American belligerence but Iranian truculence. 
    But this approach fails to recognize that an arms-control process is 
    necessarily an incremental one, nor does it offer a practical substitute to 
    the existing step-by-step diplomacy. 
    Iran's nuclear program encompasses a vast complex of enrichment 
    facilities, centrifuge construction plants, uranium extraction companies 
    and thousands of scientists working in university and government 
    laboratories. Iran is enriching uranium at both 5% and 20% levels, 
    experimenting with high-velocity centrifuges and seemingly in the process 
    of constructing additional enrichment facilities. 
    Such a multilayered, multifaceted program can be dealt with only on a 
    piecemeal basis, as the technical details and rules for inspections are too 
    complex to be addressed in a single agreement. 
    Moreover, should the United States offer Iran a final deal, Tehran still has 
    a right to contest and negotiate its provisions and offer counterproposals.

    Editorial 
    February 8, 2013 --The Farsi word for "no" is na h, which is easy enough 
    to remember. Maybe even Joe Biden won't forget it the next time the U.S. 
    tries to reach out diplomatically to Iran. 
    We're speaking of the Administration's latest effort to come to terms with 
    Tehran over its nuclear programs, which Mr. Biden made last weekend at 
    the Munich Security Conference. The U.S. offer of direct bilateral talks, 
    he said, "stands, but it must be real and tangible." Iranian foreign minister 
    Ali Akbar Salehi, who was also at the conference though he refused to 
    meet with U.S. officials, called Mr. Biden's comments "a step forward." 
    Mr. Salehi's remark set the usual hearts aflutter that Iran is finally serious 
    about a deal. But the optimism was brief On Thursday, Iran's Supreme 
    Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei flatly rejected direct talks with the U.S. 
    "The U.S. is pointing a gun at Iran and wants us to talk to them," he said. 
    "Direct talks will not solve any problems." 
    This isn't the first time Mr. Khamenei has played chaste Daphne to 
    President Obama's infatuated Apollo. Just after becoming President in 
    2009, Mr. Obama sent the Ayatollah two private letters and delivered a 
    conciliatory speech for the Persian new year of Nowruz. Mr. Khamenei's 
    answer: "They chant the slogan of change but no change is seen in 
    practice." He told a crowd chanting "death to America" that "if a hand is 
    stretched covered with a velvet glove but it is cast iron inside, that makes 
    no sense." 
    That was in March 2009. In October of that year the U.S. and its allies 
    tentatively worked out a deal with Iranian negotiators to move some of
