    Dear Jeffrey, 
    Larry has told me that you and a friend would like to contribute to my project (hallelujah and thank you a 
    million times, Jeffrey) and that I ought to write up a proposal asking for 500,000. This is wonderful. If this 
    comes to pass, the best way for that money to come, I think, is as a gift to Poetry in America, an initiative at 
    EdLabs at Harvard University. This will give me discretion over its disbursement to HarvardX and WGBH, 
    but this will be absolutely be a Harvard gift that will count as Campaign success and from which Harvard 
    will take some (but not as much)overhead. . So far the best finance people I've met are at EdLabs and they are 
    happy to manage these funds for me. There are other ways to give me this money that leave Harvard out, but 
    my understanding is that your friend would like this to be a Harvard gift. 
    Here's a draft of what I'd like to do with that money. 
    I'd like 500,000 to do post-production and distribution of a whole historical period of American poetry 
    (1914-1945 is what I'm thinking—Modernism) and including three episodes of tv. 
    The raw materials for that period include interviews with Bill Clinton (including footage not yet used by 
    WGBH), Peter Gallison, Walter Isaacson, Lena Dunham, Woody Allen (whose lawyers didn't like our release 
    a while ago, but we're hoping will soften over time), Harrison Ford (still a maybe), Robert Polito, Sarah Kay, 
    Al Filreis, Rafael Campo, Susan Howe, kids from Nantucket High School, kids from Brookline High
