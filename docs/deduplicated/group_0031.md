    seems very one-sided and as if the makers didn't quite see the bigger picture

    Who Maimed the Economy, and How 
    By A. 0. SCOTT 
    "Inside Job," a sleek, briskly paced film whose title suggests a heist movie, is the story of a crime 
    without punishment, of an outrage that has so far largely escaped legal sanction and societal stigma. The 
    betrayal of public trust and collective values that Mr. Ferguson chronicles was far more brazen and 
    damaging than the adultery in Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel, which treated Hester more as scapegoat than 
    villain. 
    The gist of this movie, which begins in a mood of calm reflection and grows angrier and more incredulous 
    as it goes on, is unmistakably punitive. The density of information and the complexity of the subject 
    matter make "Inside Job" feel like a classroom lecture at times, but by the end Mr. Ferguson has summoned 
    the scourging moral force of a pulpit-shaking sermon. That he delivers it with rigor, restraint and good 
    humor makes his case all the more devastating. 
    He is hardly alone in making it. Numerous journalists have published books and articles retracing the 
    paths that led the world economy to the precipice two years ago. The deregulation of the financial 
    services industry in the 1980s and '90s; the growing popularity of complex and risky derivatives; the
