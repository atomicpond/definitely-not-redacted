    Title: DEEP THINKING
    Subtitle: Twenty-Five Ways of Looking at AI
    By: John Brockman
    Length: 90,000 words
    Headline: Science world luminary John Brockman assembles twenty-five of the most
    important scientific minds, people who have been thinking about the field artificial
    intelligence for most of their careers for an unparalleled round-table examination about
    mind, thinking, intelligence and what it means to be human.
    Description:
    "Artificial intelligence is today's story—the story behind all other stories. It is the Second
    Coming and the Apocalypse at the same time: Good AI versus evil AI." —John
    Brockman
    More than sixty years ago, mathematician-philosopher Norbert Wiener published a book
    on the place of machines in society that ended with a warning: “we shall never receive
    the right answers to our questions unless we ask the right questions…. The hour is very
    late, and the choice of good and evil knocks at our door.”
    In the wake of advances in unsupervised, self-improving machine learning, a small but
    influential community of thinkers is considering Wiener’s words again. In Deep
    Thinking, John Brockman gathers their disparate visions of where AI might be taking us.
    The fruit of the long history of Brockman’s profound engagement with the most
    important scientific minds who have been thinking about AI—from Alison Gopnik and
    David Deutsch to Frank Wilczek and Stephen Wolfram— Deep Thinking is an ideal
    introduction to the landscape of crucial issues AI presents.
    The collision between opposing perspectives is salutary and exhilarating; some of these
    figures, such as computer scientist Stuart Russell, Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn, and
    physicist Max Tegmark, are deeply concerned with the threat of AI, including the
    existential one, while others, notably robotics entrepreneur Rodney Brooks, philosopher
    Daniel Dennett, and bestselling author Steven Pinker, have a very different view. Serious,
    searching and authoritative, Deep Thinking la
