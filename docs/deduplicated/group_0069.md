    Re: Ms. Immigration Application 
    Dear Sir or Madam: 
    I am writing this letter on behalf of Ms. and in 
    connection with her 0-1 Visa Application. 
    My name is David Blaine and I am a magician, an illusionist and an 
    endurance artist. I am known for my high-profile feats of endurance, and 
    have made my name as a performer of street and close-up magic. I have 
    performed all over the world and have set and broken several world records, 
    including holding my breath for more than 17 minutes, spending 35 hours 
    atop a 105-foot pole and surviving a week buried in a coffin. I have traveled 
    internationally performing magic privately for President Bill Clinton and 
    Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, President George W. Bush, Secretary of 
    Defense Donald Rumsfeld at the Pentagon, Governor Arnold 
    Schwarzenegger, Henry Kissinger, Bill Gates and Mayor Michael Bloomberg. 
    I have also performed magic for the President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev, 
    the President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili, the President of Ukraine Victor 
    Yanukovych, and the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev. 
    I met a few years ago through mutual friends 
    and I was highly impressed with her: I first met her as an amazing fashion 
    model, but, then, I discovered her intelligence, education, and her passion for 
    children and education. So, when I saw the other side of Svet, performing her 
    own brand of magic in fundraisers and other high end charitable events and 
    organizations, I realized what an amazingly talented public relations and 
    fundraising expert she is, and I was not surprised the least. 
    When it comes to organizing events, finding A-list funders for her 
    causes, in my opinion, is at the top of her game and is a true magician — 
    the success stories she pulled for the children on the US Virgin Islands, the 
    Ivory Coast, and many others are true miracles

    Dear Sir or Madam: 
    Immigration Application 
    I am writing this letter on behalf of Ms. and in 
    connection with her 0-1 Visa Application. 
    My name is David Blaine and I am a magician. I have performed my 
    own brand of close up magic all over the world, and have also set and broken 
    several world records, including holding my breath for over 17 minutes, 
    spending 35 hours atop a 100-foot pole, surviving only on water for 44 days, and 
    enduring a week buried in a coffin. I have traveled internationally, performing 
    magic privately for President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary 
    Clinton, President George W. Bush, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld at 
    the Pentagon, Henry Kissinger, Bill Gates and Mayor Michael Bloomberg. 
    I met Ms_____________________a few years ago through mutual friends 
    and I was highly impressed with her. Aside from being an amazing fashion 
    model, she has a strong passion for children and education. I realized what a 
    talented public relations and fundraising expert she is when I saw her 
    organizing numerous high end charitable events and organizations, as well as 
    finding A-list funders for her causes. 
    A fundraiser and public relations expert of extraordinary ability can 
    find, target, and approach the correct people for their cause, and then recruit 
    them with the correct individual enticements. This is a very difficult thing to 
    pull off, but Svetlana was able to do so, not only with efficiency and success, 
    but with great ease and grace, and she seems determined to keep going. The 
    success stories she drew for the children of the US Virgin Islands, the Ivory 
    Coast, and many others are incredible. She truly makes a difference in the 
    lives of the world's children. 
    That is a passion that we both share. Every year, I travel all across the 
    country and the world to perform magic for children's hospital wards, burn 
    units, and juvenil
