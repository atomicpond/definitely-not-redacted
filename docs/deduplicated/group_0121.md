    I know.. it is one of the reasons I respect you. 
    btw.. this was the last note I sent out to the blogs... after that I gave up.. 
    "I will add one remark here, as most people have not read my full set of comments, posted after the post 
    appeared.. I am myself rather disappointed by the lack of skepticality of this community. As I said, I have read 
    numerous reports of orgies on Jeffrey's island involving me and other scientists during our meetings.. Orgies 
    that never happened. I am VERY skeptical of other claims on his behavior. I am defending Jeffrey for 2 
    reasons: (1) Based on my knowledge and experience I am skeptical of the claims in the media and of those who 
    have settled claims for money... namely I don't believe the published details just like I tend to be skeptical of 
    many published details on the internet.. I don't believe Jeffrey did what has been claimed, and unless I see hard 
    evidence, I will trust my own judgement here, and (2) Jeffrey went to prison, and I happen to believe that 
    having served time, even those who questioned his behavior should be willing to give him the benefit of the 
    doubt, again until proved otherwise, that he is working hard to live a good life and do good things. I for one am 
    disgusted that people eat up the salacious nonsense they read on the web and then jump to conclusions about 
    things and people they do not know.. I do not jump to condemn people, especially when it concerns their sexual 
    preferences. I DO NOT CONDONE sex with young girls, or young boys for that matter.. because there are real 
    victims there.. Until I know all the facts however, I do not jump to conclusions, and I am sorry, having seen the 
    media frenzy around Jeffrey, and having seen the shoddy behavior of those who have attacked him, I remain 
    skeptical, and I support a man whose character I believ

    Here is my response to the hundreds who are now attacking me on the web: 
    I will add one remark here, as most people have not read my full set of comments, posted after the post 
    appeared.. I am myself rather disappointed by the lack of skepticality of this community. As I said, I have read 
    numerous reports of orgies on Jeffrey's island involving me and other scientists during our meetings.. Orgies
