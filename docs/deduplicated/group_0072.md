    ﻿	The Special Counsel's office, nearly leak-proof since its inception more than a year ago and seemingly immune to the President's constant taunts, might appear to be operating in some parallel universe unmoved by the every-day political turmoil. But in the course of conversations I've had recently, as a I research a new book on President Trump and the forces arrayed against him, what has become clear is that Robert Mueller and his office are preparing for a life or death confrontation with the President and the mother of all constitutional crises.
    	My discussions have been with both White House advisors and people close to the investigation. No source involved in this story would speak on the record. But one source allowed me to review some of the documents related to the Special Counsel's strategy. Aspects of the Special Counsel's strategy have been confirmed by both White House sources and lawyers closely involved with the Justice Department. 
    	Since at least April the Special Counsel has had in place proposed charges, a bill of particulars, and an aggressive legal theory for the indictment of the president for obstruction of Justice. In the last few weeks, as the President has indulged his pardon authority, the Mueller team has also developed a legal strategy to oppose what the Special Counsel believes will be a likely pardon of former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, who had previously struck a plea bargain which could include his testimony against the President.
    	Robert Mueller, according to one person familiar with the Special Counsel's thinking, could hardly contain his disgust when Rudy Giuliani, the President's new lawyer—hired to makes a television case for the President and to push back against the Mueller team—in May airily dismissed the notion that a president can be indicted. Adding insult to injury, Giuliani—who a White House source said had likely learned of aspects of the pending indictment—said Mueller agreed with that assessment. White H

    ﻿The Special Counsel's office, nearly leak-proof since its inception more than a year ago, can appear to be operating in some parallel universe unmoved by the every-day political turmoil. But in the course of conversations I've had researching a new book on President Trump and the forces arrayed against him, it has become clear that Robert Mueller and his office are already preparing for a life or death confrontation with the President and the mother of all constitutional crises.
    	Over the last several months the Mueller office has prepared a possible indictment of the president on charges related to obstruction of justice and devised a legal strategy to navigate the inevitable fallout from such an indictment.
    	My discussions have been with both White House advisors and people close to the investigation—that is, sources on both sides of the possible conflict. No source involved in this story would speak on the record. But in broad-strokes each side's understanding matches the account provided to me by the other side.
    	Since at least April the Special Counsel has had in place a set of allegations, proposed charges, and an aggressive legal theory to support the indictment of the president on obstruction charges. In the last few weeks, as the President has indulged his pardon authority, the Mueller team has also developed a legal basis to oppose what the Special Counsel believes will be a likely pardon of former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn—who had previously struck a plea bargain which could include his testimony against the President—and what it believes to be another step in the President's obstruction efforts.
    	At this point, the case for indictment has, in effect, a judge of one, since the Mueller team must get the approval of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to proceed. As recently as April, Rosenstein publicly declared that the President was not a target, but this may have been a kind of fig leaf: technically the President does not become a for
