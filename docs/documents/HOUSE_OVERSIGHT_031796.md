Trump advisors reportedly seeking a 
pardon for 'junk bond king' Milken 
Tae Kim 
Several of President Donald Trump's advisors are pushing him to pardon **Michael Milken**, 
****Bloomberg** News** reported **Friday**. 
**Michael Milken**, 71, was known as the "junk bond king" in **the 1980s** and was convicted for 
securities fraud. 
**Bloomberg** said former **White **HOUSE**** communications director Anthony Scaramucci, 
**Treasury** Secretary Steven Mnuchin, senior advisor **Jared Kushner** and attorney Rudy  
Giuliani support the pardon for Milken. 
Milken has a net worth of $3.7 billion, according to **Forbes**. The financier, who pioneered 
the market for high-yield bonds while at **Drexel Burnham Lambert**, was sentenced to 10 
years in prison and permanently banned from the securities industry by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. His prison term was reduced to **two years**. 
**the **White **HOUSE****** and a spokesperson for the Milken Institute did not immediately respond 
to requests for comment.
