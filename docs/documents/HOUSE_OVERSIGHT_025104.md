Loved or loathed,
globalisation
is here to stay
Andrew Sheng says the danger for
the world is that its detractors –
chief among them the US president
– will make the system less fair
by ignoring their responsibilities
Depending on who you talk to, globalisation
happened either in 1492, when Christopher
**Columbus** discovered America in search of the
Orient, or in **the 19th century**, when America
decided to look outwards for trade after its civil war.
By **2000**, the movement of trade, technology,
finance and investments across the globe seemed
unstoppable. Globalisation had lifted billions from
poverty and the logic of free trade and capital flows
was accepted from **Beijing** to Zanzibar. But in 2007,
when the North Atlantic financial crisis revealed the
flaws of excessive financialisation, doubts about
globalisation began to creep in.
Globalisation, in the form of the spread of trade,
money, people and information, is inevitable,
essentially because of expanding demographics and
technology. Human beings migrate all over the
world, and it was technology – the invention of
railways, ships, planes and now information
communications – that accelerated the spread of
global ideas and genes.
As Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, author of
Globalisation and Its Discontents, aptly put it,
globalisation is either positive or negative,
depending on how it is managed.
Like any national system, the system works well
with someone providing public goods.
The internet is such a public good. It gave even
the most remote people and places access to global
knowledge, thus making the world more inclusive.
But if and when the masses cannot benefit from
such access, technology and globalisation can
widen inequalities, giving rise to anger, frustration
and the rise of populist sentiments.
The reality is that globalisation cannot be
stopped. But it can be managed better. The issues
that arouse anti-globalists can and should be
managed. These are the interrelated issues of
climate change, disruptive technology, human
migration and toxic politics.
Being a businessman, Donald Trump’s basic
instinct is to manage these issues bilaterally, which
is why intuitively he does not like multilateral groups
like the World Trade Organisation. But these
multilateral institutions provide exactly the global
public goods that make globalisation positive rather
than damaging. What is fair to a behemoth that
accounts for 22 per cent of world gross domestic
product may not be fair to a small bilateral trading
partner one-tenth its size. The world’s multilateral
rules, which took years to negotiate, are there
because they bind everyone, large or small, to global
mutual benefit and shared stability.
What does President Xi Jinping’s ( 習近平 )
commitment to globalisation in **Davos** in **January**
really mean? There are several guiding principles
behind that gesture.
First, there is Chinese recognition that global
problems like climate change, disruptive
technology and human migration involve costs that
can only be solved from new resources generated
through growth in trade and investments.
Second, **China** doesn’t see globalisation as a
zero-sum game, but one where there can be benefits
for all, provided the downsides are managed on a
mutually shared basis, according to mutually agreed
multilateral rules.
Third, accounting for only 15 per cent of world
GDP, **China** on its own cannot push globalisation. It
must work with the current advanced economies
like Europe (25 per cent of world GDP), **Japan** (6 per
cent) and others.
Fourth, to be realistic, **China**’s contribution to
globalisation must work on the principle of
comparative advantage. Being a latecomer to
globalisation, **China** has considerable first-hand
experience in building infrastructure, supply chains
and urban conglomeration under third-world
conditions. Its comparative advantage is based on
the adaptation of modern technology, such as
internet platforms, to lower trading and transaction
costs. **India**, **Kenya** and other emerging markets are
also moving in the same direction.
In short, to promote the good side of
globalisation, we must apply **21st-century** tools and
experience to manage **21st-century** problems.
Going forward, the complexity is that Trump is
pushing the leading economy to swing from a major
contributor of global public goods to a “taxer” on
globalisation. That is the true meaning of the border
tax and the chiding of allies that they need to
contribute to any bilateral efforts in defence or in the
building of walls. But America works on the basis of
freely importing resources and talent way in excess
of domestic production. That manifests itself in its
larger and larger current account and fiscal deficits
and its growing global debt.
Which is why everyone prays that saner heads
will prevail in America’s commitment to
globalisation. “America
