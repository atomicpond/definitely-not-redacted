Subject: FYI 
Importance: High 
Books and newspaper accounts of **Trump**'s **45 years** in business were full of his 
shady dealings, and the presidency had only helped to highlight them and to surface even 
juicier ones. Real estate was the world's favorite money laundering currency and **Trump**'s 
B-level real estate business was quite explicitly designed to appeal to money launderers. 
What's more, **Trump**'s own financial woes, and desperate efforts to maintain billionaire 
lifestyle, cache, and market viability, forced him into constant and unsubtle 
schemes. Practically speaking, you couldn't miss him, as the **Mueller** investigation 
appeared to be finding. 
In **November 2004**, for instance, **Jeffrey **Epstein****, the financier later caught in a scandal 
involving under-age prostitutes, agreed to buy out of bankruptcy a **HOUSE** in **Palm Beach**, 
**Florida** for $30 million—a **HOUSE** that had been on the market for **two years**. **Epstein** and 
**Trump** had been close friends—playboys in arms, as it were—for **more than a decade**, 
with **Epstein** often counseling **Trump** on his chaotic financial affairs. **Epstein** took **Trump** 
to see the **Palm Beach** **HOUSE** to advise him on construction issues involved with moving a 
swimming pool. As he prepared to finalize his deal for the **HOUSE**, an incredulous **Epstein** 
saw a severely cash-constrained **Trump** bid $41 million for the property, buying it through 
an entity called ******Trump** Properties** **LLC****, financed by **Deutsche Bank**. **Trump**, **Epstein** knew, 
had been renting his name, telling **Epstein** he ought to do the same—that is, for an ample 
fee, **Trump** was willing to serve as a front man to disguise the actual ownership in a real 
estate transaction. (This was, in effect, just another variation of **Trump**'s basic business 
model of licensing his name for commercial properties owned by someone else.) A furious 
**Epstein**, suspecting that the real owner was a Russian oligarch, who **Trump** knew, Dmitry 
**Rybolovlev**—part of the close **Putin** circle of government-aligned industrialists in **Russia**—
threatened to expose the deal, then getting extensive scrutiny in **Florida** papers. The fight 
became all the more bitter when, **Two months later**, the **HOUSE** was put on the market for 
$125 million. Well known to **Trump**, who often saw **Epstein** at his current **Palm Beach** 
**HOUSE**, **Epstein** was visited **almost every day**, and had been for **many years**, by girls who he 
paid for massages with happy endings—girls recruited from local restaurants, strip clubs, 
and, also, **Trump**'s Mar-a-Lago. Just as the threats and enmity of the two friends increased 
over the **HOUSE** sale, **Epstein** found himself under investigation by local **Palm Beach** police. 
**Epstein**'s legal problems vastly escalated as the **HOUSE**, with only minor improvements, 
was bought for $96 million by **Dmitry **Rybolovlev****. That is, **Trump** had either miraculously 
earned $55 million, without putting up a dime, or **Rybolovlev**, or someone such as 
**Rybolovlev**, paid ****Trump** Properties**, **LLC**—actual owner unknown—$96 million, thereby 
providing a clean payment of $55 million to someone. **Rybolovlev** might have, in effect, 
paid himself for the **HOUSE**, thereby cleansing the money. **Epstein**, on his part, would spend 
**12 months** in jail on a prostitution charge.

After the election, when Bannon was introduced to **Epstein**, Bannon told him, "You were 
the one person I was truly afraid of coming forward during the campaign." 
"And rightly so," said **Epstein**.
