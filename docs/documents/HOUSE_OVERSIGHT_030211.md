Objet: (s) 7/11, Atlantic Council (Hof): **Syria**: **BlackBerry** Diplomacy 
Atlantic Council 
**Syria**: **BlackBerry** Diplomacy 
By Frederic C. Hof 
July 11, **2013**

"Seche, Stephen A." 
>, "Dixon, Timothy" 
A friendly discussion about **Syria** with a former **US State Department** colleague gave rise to a point I 
will not soon forget. "**Fred**, there's no time for policy deliberations about **Syria** or anyplace else. We 
live in the era of **BlackBerry** diplomacy. We react and we improvise as best we can." 
Anyone under the age of thirty reading the above would probably think, "Why in the world is the US 
government using the **BlackBerry**?" Those who turned thirty long before the end of the last century—
even those of us who try seriously not to be technological Luddites—wonder sometimes if the 
communications revolution and the 24/7 news cycle it has spawned will end up doing more harm than 
good to the progress of civilization and well-being of the republic. 
Those who have had the privilege and burden of working in the US national security establishment 
are well-acquainted with how hard it is to find time to think. This was true long before the advent of 
email and other forms of electronic communication. Although there may have been times when 
officials could contemplate great matters of state at something approaching leisure, those days have 
been long gone. Even offices created expressly to explore policy options stretching beyond a twenty 
minute horizon—the State Department's Policy Planning Staff comes to mind—routinely get pulled 
into the maelstrom of **daily** struggles to manage breaking developments through some combination of 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 030211 
strategic messaging and diplomatic demarches. Email makes it easy for officials up-and-down the 
chain to plunge into the fray, battling to mold language for use at a **daily** briefing; language that all-
too-often mystifies or misleads foreign listeners who hang on words from the podium as if they are 
meant to convey the results of deep, deliberative thought on the part of the world's only superpower. 
Yet email neither created the problem nor prevents its solution. 
The problem is the failure of government, certainly in the context of **Syria** and likely in other foreign 
policy contexts as well, to wrap the **daily** news cycle food fight in an insulated casing of objectives and 
strategy clearly understandable to those charged with planning and executing foreign or national 
security policy. There may be some who believe that objectives and strategy are just so 20th century; 
so Brent Scowcroft-like and so pre-Twitter. There may be some who actually handle affairs of state in 
ways they would not dream of applying to their personal financial portfolios. Perhaps resistance to 
structured, deliberative processes producing objectives and accompanying strategies is a function of 
fewer and fewer people in the national security establishment ever having availed themselves of 
military service; an experience where matters of this nature become, through training and education, 
as natural as breathing. Perhaps in the specific case of **Syria** there has been a temptation to avoid 
the hard choices such a process would serve up in the hope that the regime of Basher al-Assad 
would just go away, thereby making hard choices someone else's problem. 
The arrival of a new assistant to the president for national security affairs is an ideal opportunity to 
restore best practices to the national security apparatus. To her credit, **Susan Rice** appears to be 
reaching out with this very much in mind. If changes are made that better serve the president by 
forcing people to think through policy options in the context of objectives and strategies, those 
changes should not reflect poorly on the stewardship of her predecessor. The president gets 
precisely the national security system he mandates and deserves. He is, as **JFK** noted in the 
immediate wake of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, "the responsible officer of government." 
In the end it is the president, and not the **BlackBerry** or some other device, who will drive the direction 
and processes of foreign policy and diplomacy. It is up to him to tell his national security advisor that 
he wants the interagency to stop tweeting and start thinking; to tell him how he should be evaluating 
US national security objectives with respect
