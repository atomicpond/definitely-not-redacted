Did you see my son's email on **Sunday**?

I was so proud to see him speak at the Women's **March** **this weekend**, joining thousands of 
passionate Floridians who want real change in our state, and across the country. 
But we both know that change doesn't come easy. And there are a lot of folks in Tallahassee 
that want to keep things the same as usual. 
We can't afford the status quo so they can have their way. We need leadership that will 
bring the change that so many have been marching for over **the past year**. 
Can I count on you to help my son bring that change to Tallahassee? 
Click here to join his campaign **today**, and help him do the right thing for our 
neighbors across the state.

I spent **the day** with thousands of fellow Floridians, celebrating the one year 
anniversary of the Women's **March**. 
I was inspired by the crowds, their voice, and their passion.

Empowering women in the age of **Trump** is an essential part of moving this country 
forward. But that means moving forward on issues that have long been stalled - 
equal pay, better education, and a living wage. 
**In **2018****, we have the chance to move these issues forward, and I'm asking for your 
help in makincit happen.

If the crowds we saw in St. Petersburg, **Miami**, and dozens of other cities across this 
country are any indication, we have the momentum! 
Now we need to bring it to Tallahassee.
