Reply-To: "Ens, Amanda" 
The US team is out with their **2017** **Year Ahead** this morning (link) running through ALL sub-sectors with each analysts 
top pick into **the new year**. 
op Picks — ACAD, AGN, ANTM, CELG, CVS, DHR, EW, EVHC, RARE, REGN, **WBA** 
Washington DC Backdrop  
Given the clean sweep by the **GOP** & uncertainty around the **ACA**, key attention is paid by Andy Bressler to a review of 
the various scenarios that could play out **early next year**. With a repeal likely to happen well before a replace 
(essentially via the Budget Reconciliation process in Jan/Feb), Andy notes this is likely to include a repeal of both 
health insurance exchange subsidies & a phase-down of **Medicaid** expansion funding (albeit with a two or three year 
transition period). 
He also expects a repeal of many of the larger HC related taxes in the **ACA**, including the HIX ($14.3bn in **2018**), 
Medtech Tax (2.3%), pharma industry tax ($4.1bn in **2018**) & Cadillac tax (effective **2020**). 
As for the views by analysts...  
Biotech (+) — believe sector will outperform largely as pricing risk has diminished (although will remain in pockets) but 
pipelines/growth remains. Ying's top picks are CELG & REGN; Tazeen's top picks are kCAD & RARE. 
Spec Pharma (-) — headwinds remain w/ Sumant's top pick AGN given lower risk to reimbursement pressures & an 
underappreciated pipeline. Leverage & CF remain the key focus for investors. 
Tools/Animal Health (=) — Derik notes more "headline" than "real" risks from policy which will create opportunities for a 
group growing MSD, although valuations remain above peers. (US 1 name) top pick, also A, ZTS in Animal 
Health, in Diagnostics & in Services. 
Medtech (=) — Hopkins' expects a mixed bag in **2017** w/ stocks trading close to 5yr valuation lows; EW top pick given 
best growth / purest innovation story. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 014523 
Facilities (-) — Fischbeck notes that uncertainty will remain an overhang for hospitals as repeal/replace a negative for 
the group (est losing 2-3mm **Medicaid** lives & 2-3mm exchange lives would be a 1-2% EBITDA hit on avg). Focus on 
company-specific stories like 
MCOs (+) — Fischbeck generally +ve under Trump (especially around MA given historical support from **GOP**) w/ 
tailwinds from corporate tax & rising rates. top pick in given valuation & tailwinds. 
Distribution/Tech (=) — Valiquette prefers pharmacies ,,,'VS/**WBA** given benefits from decelerating generic prices 
(which will remain an overhang for Distributors). **HHS** appointment a —ve for HCIT.
