﻿10/5/2015 Jeffrey Epstein 'sex slave' Virginia Roberts was a 'money­hungry sex kitten', ex friends claim | Daily Mail Online
'millionaire's house' for a day or two, before returning with cash.
He did say that she tried to get out of the sex business, but was dragged back in.
Last month it was revealed Roberts accused two male acquaintances she was raped, bringing her
credibility into question.
Roberts' lawyers says the latest allegations do not contend the fact she was used for underage sex.
Attorney Sigrid McCawleysaid : 'To say that our client acquiesced in this abuse, or that the abuse
was OK because she was paid for it — leaves out the fact that this is why we have laws in the United
States to protect minor children who are groomed and sexually trafficked by adults.'
Epstein served 13 months in a Florida prison after pleading guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for
prostitution.

The scandal resurfaced in January when Roberts named Prince Andrew in a lawsuit, accusing him
of using her for underage sex.
According to court records connected with Roberts' current lawsuit, she maintains that she was
recruited to join Epstein's harem in 1999 by his friend, the socialite **Ghislaine Maxwell**.
She says during **the three years** she worked for Epstein, she was made to entertain his friends and
named Prince Andrew and Dershowitz as two men she had sex with.
Both men have denied having sex with Roberts, and Dershowitz is trying to get his name removed
from the suit, claiming Roberts made the entire story up.
