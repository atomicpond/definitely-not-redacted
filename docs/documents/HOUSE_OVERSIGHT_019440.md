And the beat goes on…
Last fall’s 16-day government shutdown ended with legislation that **President Obama** signed in the wee
hours of October 17 th . Under that legislation, a bipartisan committee hammered out a budget agreement by
**mid-**December****; **Congress** approved the agreement, and **President Obama** signed it into law. **HOUSE** and
**Senate** appropriations committees then began drafting spending bills – on which they compromised: H.R.
3547, the “Consolidated Appropriations Act, **2014**,” passed both the **HOUSE** and the **Senate** with comfortable
bipartisan majorities; it became Public Law 113-76 on **January** 17 th , when **President Obama** signed it. The
Act allocates $1.012 trillion, is over 1500 pages long and funds the government through September 30, **2014**
(the end of the current **2014** **fiscal year**).
The Act restored some of the funding cuts otherwise dictated by the “sequester,” which was born of budget
legislation (and the debt ceiling crisis) in **August 2011**. It covers discretionary spending for all government
agencies, and has nothing to do with mandatory spending, such as **Social Security**. In other words, for
example, the Act covers national defense, commerce, the judiciary and what are referred to as “financial
services,” which includes the **IRS**. Although overall appropriations are up slightly for financial services from
**last year’s** enacted level, the $11.289 billion appropriated for the **IRS** is about 4% less than last year, and
continues a downward trend in **IRS** funding.
Under the Act, the **IRS** will have new **quarterly** reporting requirements with respect to some of its spending,
and must abide by some pointed directives, including maintaining training programs to cover items such as
“taxpayers’ rights, dealing courteously with taxpayers, cross-cultural relations, ethics and the impartial
application of tax law.” An additional $92 million is potentially available to the **IRS** to supplement certain
areas of its budget, but not until the **IRS** Commissioner first provides a spending plan for those dollars, none
of which can be used to support any provision of the Affordable Care Act (**ACA**, which is also known as
“**Obamacare**”). The **IRS** also cannot make a video unless it is pre-approved by the Service-Wide Video
**Editorial Board**, nor can the Service use any of its funds to target citizens who are exercising their First
Amendment rights or to target groups for “regulatory scrutiny based on their ideological beliefs.”
In other words, the budget takes note of recent issues that have reflected poorly on the **IRS**, including the
Service’s enhanced scrutiny of politically conservative groups that were seeking tax-exempt status as
501(c)(4) social welfare organizations, and the disclosure of certain training videos that spoofed several old
television shows and were deemed wasteful. John Koskinen, the new **IRS** Commissioner, has many
challenges ahead of him, including restoring public confidence in the agency and boosting employee morale.
National Taxpayer Advocate
Nina Olson has been the National Taxpayer Advocate since **2001**. She heads up the Taxpayer Advocate
Service (TAS), which was created in **2000**, and is an independent organization within the **IRS**. Ms. Olson
and the TAS are the taxpayer’s “voice at the **IRS**.” The TAS is designed to help taxpayers navigate issues
with the **IRS** when the usual channels have failed; in addition, Ms. Olson regularly focuses on larger issues
within the **IRS** and the tax system itself, and recommends solutions. Her **year-end** **annual** Reports to
**Congress** are thorough and thoughtful, and in part, detail what she views as the most serious issues facing
taxpayers.
Ms. Olson’s **2013** **annual** Report was released on **January** 9, **2014**, and, as always, is interesting reading.
One of the critical issues Ms. Olson focuses on in this report is that the **IRS** “desperately” needs more
funding to serve taxpayers and increase voluntary compliance. Ms. Olson presents some compelling
statistics to support this statement. In **fiscal year** **2013**, for example:
• The **IRS** received about 109 million phone calls; only 61% of the callers seeking a customer service
representative got through, and those who did had to wait an average of 18 minutes before speaking
with someone.
• The **IRS** received about 8.4 million letters from taxpayers responding to proposed adjustments to their
tax accounts; it was unable to respond to 53% of this correspondence within its target timeframes.
• The **IRS** continues to reduce (and sometimes eliminate) services at its nearly 400 walk-in sites; the
Service will only answer “basic” tax law questions during this current filing season (**January** through
**April**), and will not answer any of those questions beyond **April**.
Ms. Olson also notes that since **fiscal year** 2010, the **IRS** workforce has declined about 8%, and that its
training budget has been “slashed” from about $172 million to about $22 million, a “staggering” 87%
reduction. “Thus,” she
