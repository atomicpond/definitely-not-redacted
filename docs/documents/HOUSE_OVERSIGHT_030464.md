by **Vicky Ward** <http://www.vanityfair.com/contributors/vicky-ward> 
**March 8, 2011**, 2:30 PM 
"I've got a story idea for you. The rebuilding of **Indonesia**. Or **New Orleans**. Or both. Go there. I've just been. 
You will never think the same way about anything again." 
So spoke not Bill or **Melinda Gates**, but ******Ghislaine**** ****Maxwell******, the **48-year-old** woman being written up 
everywhere at the moment as the alleged "procurer" of young women for billionaire ****Jeffrey** **Epstein****. 
**Epstein**, 57, is the financier who spent **a year** in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of 
another investigation because various women, now in **their twenties and thirties**, have come forward with 
allegations that he molested them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British 
newspapers, which have zeroed in on **Epstein**'s friendship with **Prince Andrew**, who has recently tried to 
publicly disassociate himself from his old pal. 
I wrote a piece for **Vanity Fair** in 2003 called "The Talented Mr. **Epstein**." It was largely a business piece that 
focused on his mysterious exit from **Bear Stearns** in 1981, his close relationships with **Jimmy Cayne**, **Les 
Wexner**, the chairman of **Limited Brands**, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, **Steven Jude 
Hoffenberg**, who is currently serving a **20-year**-jail sentence for bilking investors in **Towers Financial** out of 
$450 million. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030464 
The piece alluded to **Epstein**'s great friendship with ****Maxwell****, and how she introduced him to young women 
with whom he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn't really go there, focusing instead on the 
issue that remains a mystery—how **Jeffrey** made his money, and how ****Ghislaine**** made hers. 
This is not to say I didn't hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I 
concentrated on the intriguing financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same 
ones, different ones. And their stories are bone-chilling. Journalists from **England** have phoned—and, in one 
case, flown—to ask me about **Epstein** and ****Maxwell****. Who is he? And the British, especially, want to know: Who 
is she? At this point, I am so bored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all, my 2003 **Vanity Fairstory** 
that really brought him into the limelight—that I have decided to write about this myself. 
Bizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know **Jeffrey** and ****Ghislaine**** far better after my piece than before it. I kept 
running into both of them, separately, at parties. **Jeffrey** is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of 
young women with him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. "Do they speak?" I remember 
asking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He laughed. "Not like you,Vicky," was his riposte. 
I remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn't 
studied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at 
home via messenger. It was a book: "Math for idiots." 
So he is not without humor, even though he doesn't drink or smoke, and hates restaurants. 
"**Jeffrey** knows a good deal about most subjects," newspaper publisher **Mort Zuckerman** told me **last week**. He 
was certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, **Epstein** does know a lot about a lot of things
