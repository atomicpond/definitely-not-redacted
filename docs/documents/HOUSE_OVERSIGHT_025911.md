I openly and proudly support Trump. 
I've actually been able to pull people away from Hillary by saying I'd ONLY vote for Trump or Sanders. Citing 
they everyone else is establishment politics. I convinced a lesbian woman, older, to consider Trump after she

went on a rampage about him. It just shows, people HAVE NO IDEA what they are talking about. Media holds 
the cards.... people are sheep.

>> Understanding Donald Trump **The Washington Times** January 8, 2016 by Newt Gingrich

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025913 
>> Donald Trump is a genuine phenomenon. He may or may not become the Republican nominee for 
president. He may or may not win the presidency even if he becomes the nominee. Yet it is clear that he is a 
phenomenon and that any history of the 2016 presidential race will have to spend a good bit of time analyzing 
Trump and his impact. 
>> From the time he announced on ****June** 16**, Trump has dominated social and mainstream media. He 
dominates the conversation despite the lack of paid advertising. Trump says outrageous things and his 
supporters shrug it off. At every turn, his poll numbers continue to rise. 
>> As a step toward understanding this amazing performance, I spent part of the **Christmas** break reading his 
first bestseller, 'The Art of the Deal'. Written in **1987**, this book is a classic among American business books 
and has influenced a generation of entrepreneurs. Trump wrote 'The Art of the Deal' when he was 41 years 
old and having a successful run. The book's popularity contributed to Time Magazine's decision to feature
