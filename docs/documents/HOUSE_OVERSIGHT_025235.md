Eye on the Market, April 9, 2012 (attached pdf is easier to read **this week**)

Topics: Q&A on the USA, with a watchful eye on the risk of giant man-eating plants; **Spain**

 

Our view for 2012 was that economic and equity market conditions in the US and Asia ex-**Japan** would be better than in Europe.  So far, that view is on track.  **Spain** in particular is in difficult shape (see page 5); its banks and government may have to borrow 1.5 trillion Euros over **the next 12 months** while in recession.  Both the ECB and EU will need to keep the spigot open to prevent **Spain** from becoming a bigger problem.  **this week**, some Q&A on the US recovery, flows into bonds and stocks, profits and P/E multiples, municipal bonds, and the long-term US fiscal situation. 

 

The Fed appears to be saying that no additional monetary easing is needed unless the economy worsens further.  Are there any signs that the US recovery is becoming self-reinforcing?

Durable goods consumption, equipment & software spending, vehicle sales, **Bank** loans to companies, manufacturing payrolls (even after **Friday**’s disappointing report) and housing stats (building permits, multifamily housing starts) have improved over **the last few months**.  While delinquency rates are in better shape (credit card delinquencies are back to 2007 levels), household credit growth is still weak.  However, homebuilders are seeing stronger demand, and nationwide remodeling continues to rise.  We see opportunities in retailing and building products companies that may benefit from a continuation in these trends.

 



 

Has the data really been that good?  I heard better US economic data has a lot to do with the weather.

Parts of the US experienced the warmest **March** in recorded history.  Measured from December to February, **the winter** was the 4th warmest on record.  I don’t think there are reliable models to estimate the impact of demand being pulled forward, so we will have to see how consumer spending, housing and payrolls behave in **the months ahead**.  As our Chief Economist Michael Vaknin reminds me, other distortions come from the “catch-up” effect from **Japan**’s tsunami.  As shown below, some strength in auto sales came from pent-up demand for Japanese cars, a process which now seems complete.

 



 

So where does that leave the US payroll and growth picture?

The weakness in the payroll report was almost entirely concentrated in retailing.  Net of distortions and seasonal adjustments, it looks like payroll growth is running at 150-175k per month, and GDP growth is running at a 2.25% trend pace, both below prior recoveries.  While 2.25% is a barn-burner compared to Europe, it only corresponds to a modest improvement in employment.  That’s why 2013 US fiscal policy is so important: this is not a recovery that can withstand much tighter fiscal conditions.

 

So, how tight is US fiscal policy supposed to get **next year**?

Very, if you look at what is supposed to happen according to current law. In the chart, we show the **annual** change in the budget deficit over **the last 25 years**.  The impact of all provisions scheduled to expire and kick in during 2013 would be very large.  But if **Congress** and the President elect to extend current tax rates, retain lower payroll tax rates and extended jobless benefits, etc, the adjustment would not be as big, and only reflect expiration of Recovery Act provisions, the recently passed Budget Control Act, and some other smaller provisions.  There are of course plenty of permutations in between.

 



 

What direction is the **Congress** heading, and what did **Larry **Summers**** and Brad DeLong have to say about this recently?

Political outcomes **this fall** will affect what **Congress** does, but I get the sense that they will punt fiscal adjustments into the future if they can, and impose austerity of no more than 1% of GDP in 2013.   If so, **Congress** can point to a ****March** 2012** paper by **Summers** and DeLong as justification.  The bottom line from the paper: don’t tighten fiscal policy when interest rates are near zero.  The authors assert that (a) additional government spending can ease the long-term budget constraint in conditions similar to today’s, and (b) tightening policy now would risk permanent loss of human capital, lower labor productivity growth and lower trend growth.  They have held these views for a while; the paper appears designed to convince others.

 

Advocates for more fiscal and monetary stimulus often point to the charts below.  Rising Federal debt has not resulted in higher interest rates, so why not keep borrowing more?  As for the Fed, balance sheet expansion prevented deflation and hasn’t resulted in an inflationary surge (core inflation measured over 3 months just came in below 2%), so why not keep doing it?   Aren’t these charts amazing?
