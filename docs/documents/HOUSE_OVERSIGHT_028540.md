NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is
being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.
The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been
prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.
**See **United States**** v. Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.
****Supreme Court**** OF **the **United States****
Syllabus
JAM ET AL. v. INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORP.
CERTIORARI TO **the **United States**** COURT OF APPEALS FOR
**the District of Columbia** CIRCUIT
No. 17–1011. Argued October 31, 2018—Decided February 27, 2019
In 1945, **Congress** passed the International Organizations Immunities
Act (IOIA), which, among other things, grants international organizations
the “same immunity from suit ... as is enjoyed by foreign
governments.” 22 U. S. C. §288a(b). At that time, foreign governments
were entitled to virtually absolute immunity as a matter of international
grace and comity. In 1952, **the **State **Department****** adopted
a more restrictive theory of foreign sovereign immunity, which
**Congress** subsequently codified in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities
Act (FSIA), 28 U. S. C. §1602. The FSIA gives foreign sovereign governments
presumptive immunity from suit, §1604, subject to several
statutory exceptions, including, as relevant here, an exception for actions
based on commercial activity with a sufficient nexus with the
**United States**, §1605(a)(2).
Respondent International Finance Corporation (IFC), an IOIA international
organization, entered into a loan agreement with Coastal
Gujarat Power Limited, a company based in India, to finance the construction
of a coal-fired power plant in Gujarat. Petitioners sued the
IFC, claiming that pollution from the plant harmed the surrounding
air, land, and water. **The District Court**, however, held that the IFC
was immune from suit because it enjoyed the virtually absolute immunity
that foreign governments enjoyed when the IOIA was enacted.
The D. C. Circuit affirmed in light of its decision in Atkinson v.
Inter-American Development Bank, 156 F. 3d 1335.
Held: The IOIA affords international organizations the same immunity
from suit that foreign governments enjoy today under the FSIA.
Pp. 6–15.
(a) The IOIA “same as” formulation is best understood as making
international organization immunity and foreign sovereign immunity
2 JAM v. INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORP.
Syllabus
continuously equivalent. The IOIA is thus like other statutes that
use similar or identical language to place two groups on equal footing.
See, e.g., Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U. S. C. §§1981(a), 1982;
Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U. S. C. §2674. Whatever the ultimate
purpose of international organization immunity may be, the immediate
purpose of the IOIA immunity provision is expressed in language
that **Congress** typically uses to make one thing continuously equivalent
to another. Pp. 6–9.
(b) That reading is confirmed by the “reference canon” of statutory
interpretation. When a statute refers to a general subject, the statute
adopts the law on that subject as it exists whenever a question
under the statute arises. In contrast, when a statute refers to another
statute by specific title, the referenced statute is adopted as it existed
when the referring statute was enacted, without any subsequent
amendments. Federal courts have often relied on the reference
canon to harmonize a statute with an external body of law that the
statute refers to generally. The IOIA’s reference to the immunity enjoyed
by foreign governments is to an external body of potentially
evolving law, not to a specific provision of another statute. Nor is it a
specific reference to a common law concept with a fixed meaning.
The phrase “immunity enjoyed by foreign governments” is not a term
of art with substantive content but rather a concept that can be given
scope and content only by reference to the rules governing foreign
sovereign immunity. Pp. 9–11.
(c) The D. C. Circuit relied upon Atkinson’s conclusion that the reference
canon’s probative force was outweighed by an IOIA provision
authorizing the President to alter the immunity of an international
organization. But the fact that the President has power to modify
otherwise applicable immunity rules is perfectly compatible with the
notion that those rules might themselves change over time in light of
developments in the law governing foreign sovereign immunity. The
Atkinson court also did not consider the opinion of **the **State **Department******,
whose views in this area ordinarily receive “special attention,”
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela v. Helmerich & Payne Int’l Drilling
Co., 581 U. S. ___, ___, and which took the position that immunity
rules of the IOIA and the FSIA were linked following the FSIA’s enactment.
Pp. 11–13.
(d) The IFC contends that interpreting the IOIA immunity provision
to grant only restrictive immunity would defeat the purpose of
granting immunity in the first place,
