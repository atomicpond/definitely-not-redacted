Author's Note 
Shortly after Donald Trump's inauguration as the forty-fifth president of 
**the United States**, I was allowed into the West Wing as a sideline observer. 
My book Fire and Fury was the resulting account of the organizational 
chaos and constant drama—more psychodrama than political drama—of 
Trump's first seven months in office. Here was a volatile and uncertain 
president, releasing, almost on a daily basis, his strange furies on the world, 
and, at the same time, on his own staff. This first phase of the most abnor-
mal White House in American history ended in August 2017, with the 
departure of chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and the appointment of 
retired general John Kelly as chief of staff 
This new account begins in February 2018 at the outset of Trump's 
second year in office, with the situation now profoundly altered. The pres-
ident's capricious furies have been met by an increasingly organized and 
methodical institutional response. The wheels of justice are inexorably 
turning against him. In many ways, his own government, even his own 
White House, has begun to turn on him. Virtually every power center left 
of the far-right wing has deemed him unfit. Even some among his own 
base find him undependable, hopelessly distracted, and in over his head. 
Never before has a president been under such concerted attack with such 
a limited capacity to defend himself. 
His enemies surround him, dedicated to bringing him down.

AUTHOR'S NOTE

* * * 
I am joined in my train-wreck fascination with Trump—that certain 
knowledge that in the end he will destroy himself—by, I believe, almost 
everyone who has encountered him since he was elected president. 
To have worked anywhere near him is to be confronted with the most 
extreme and disorienting behavior possible. That is hardly an overstate-
ment. Not only is Trump not like other presidents, he is not like anyone 
most of us have ever known. Hence, everyone who has been close to him 
feels compelled to try to explain him and to dine out on his head-smacking 
peculiarities. It is yet one more of his handicaps: all the people around 
him, however much they are bound by promises of confidentiality or 
nondisclosure agreements or even friendship, cannot stop talking about 
their experience with him. In this sense, he is more exposed than any 
president in history. 
Many of the people in **the White House** who helped me during the 
writing of Fire and Fury are now outside of the administration, yet they are 
as engaged as ever by the Trump saga. I am grateful to be part of this sub-
stantial network. Many of Trump's pre-White House cronies continue to 
both listen to him and support him; at the same time, as an expression both 
of their concern and of their incredulity, they report among one another, 
and to others as well, on his temper, mood, and impulses. In general, I 
have found that the closer people are to him, the more alarmed they have 
found themselves at various points about his mental state. They all spec-
ulate about how this will end—badly for him, they almost all conclude. 
Indeed, Trump is probably a much better subject for writers interested in 
human capacities and failings than for most of the reporters and writers 
who regularly cover Washington and who are primarily interested in the 
pursuit of success and power. 
My primary goal in Siege is to create a readable and intuitive narrative—
that is its nature. Another goal is to write the near equivalent of a real-time 
history of this extraordinary moment, since understanding it well after 
the fact might be too late. A final goal is pure portraiture: Donald Trump 
as an extreme, almost hallucinatory, and certainly cautionary, Amer-
ican character. To accomplish this, to gain the perspective and to find 
the voices necessary to tell the larger story, I provided anonymity to any 
source who requested it. In cases where I have been told—on the prom-
ise of no attribution—about an unreported event or private conversation 
or remark, I have made every effort to confirm it with other sources or 
documents. In some cases, I have witnessed the events or conversations 
described herein. With regard to the Mueller investigation, the narrative 
I provide is based on internal documents given to me by sources close to 
the
