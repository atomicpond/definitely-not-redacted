**Dear Jeff**,

Your name popped up again in the Press and I thought it was time to congratulate you on your wonderful 
financial successes since your days as my Physics prof at **Dalton**!! The young, bright options trader, who 
understood Black Sholes and how to use it, at **Bear**, made good!! 
Unless your PR advisor is Donald Trump, I am not sure that current press provides you with much benefit. 
Perhaps I am wrong? Not the first time!! 
Anyway, middle age has brought its own unique set of challenges. Aging certainly ain't for sissy's.

Jamie Rosenwald 
Ps. **David** Asch and I toasted to you during our **Thanksgiving weekend** in Amagansett in **November**.
