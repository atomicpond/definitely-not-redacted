A routine status check **Monday** on a **2008** federal lawsuit tied to sex offender ****Jeffrey **Epstein****'s** plea deal ended with a new allegation from the government. 
The two victims who filed the lawsuit — **Jane Doe** No. 1 and **Jane Doe** No, 2 — aren't actually victims because they procured other yids for **Epstein** and received money for it, 
Assistant **United States** Attorney **Dexter Lee** said In West **Palm Beach** 'federal court, 
If someone "is complicit in the offenses," they can't be considered victims tinder the federal **Crime Victims**' **Rights Act**, Lee said. 
"A **Crime Victims**' Rights Ad action is part of a_criminal proceeding normally, but there:s nothing.nomial about this ease," be said, 
Doe 1 and 2 are among tflora than two dozen underage girls who filed awstits or settled claims against **Epstein**, alleging they were lured to his **Palm Beach** mansion to give him 
sexually charged massages and/or sex in exchange for money. They were 14 and 13 at the time. 
"**today** is the first we've heard that the victims were complicit and this disqualifies them," said victims' attorney **Brad Edwards**. 'This is an additional issue, which will lead to other 
Issues," 
Edwards added that although only two victims are named as plaintiffs, hey represent dozens of victims who were named by the government as having been victimized by **Epstein**. 
Edwards said he plans to have other victims testify at trial. 
Doe 1 and 2 etc trying to overturn a federal non-prosecution agreement struck between **Epstein** and federal prosecutors without notice to the victims — a violation of the victims' rights 
act. The agreement kept **Epstein** from facing serious federal charges and extensive prison time, 
**Epstein** signed the agreement in **September 2007**, but victims weren't notified until **January** and **May **2008****, according to entails and court documents, 
As part of the deal, **Epstein** pleaded guilty to Iwo state charges In **June **2008****, serving **13 months** of an **18-month** prison sentence in a vacant wing of the ****Palm Beach** County** stockade. 
He was awarded liberal work-releaso privileges. 
**In **January****, another **Epstein** victim alleged in court papers that **Epstein** treed her to have sex with **Britain**'s Prince Andrew and high-profile attorney Alan Dershowitz when she was a 
minor. Both have vigorously denied her claims. Dershowitz and Edwards aro suing each other in Broward County Circuit Court, alleging defamation. 
Edwards told U.S. **District Judge Kenneth** Mama that he and attorney **Paul Cassell** will file a 60-page motion for summary judgment by Dec. 15.1f that motion is denied, Edwards said 
he thinks it would be possible that the case could be ready for trial by mid-**summer**. 
That was before Lee interjected the new Issue. 
"There are no deadlines at this point," **Marra** said, 'That is the reason for this hearing, so that It doesn't tiger," 
**Marra** asked both sides to get together in **the next few weeks** and "agree on a schedule to gel things done.' 
After the hearing, Edwards said, I'm disappointed that they would ellerml to call these girls anything less than victims and It's no doubt offensive to the victims, To raise this Issue for 
the first time eight years later Is not right."
