Dear 
Jeffrey

This end-of-the-year letter is to catch you up on developments and to report progress made in 2016 
by Poetry in **America**, by its associated non-profit production company, **Verse Video Education**, and 
by (and with) our new **Harvard** partner, the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning. Whether 
you are a longstanding adviser and supporter of Poetry in **America**, or you've more recently joined 
our circle of proponents, your contributions, thought partnership and enthusiasm have made this 
year's successes possible. 
**last fall**, I knew this would be a crucial year. Goals for 2016 included moving our co-produced 
television series, Poetry in **America**, toward a concrete release date (now entering post-production, 
we launch nationwide in **April 2018**), converting our six HarvardX MOOC modules into for-credit 
courses (now complete and being offered by **Harvard**'s Division of Continuing Education), and 
getting the word out on our first course developed especially for K-12 educators, Poetry in **America**  
for Teachers: The City from Whitman to **Hip Hop**. With a mission of creating and distributing the 
highest-quality humanities content for a wide variety of learners, our projects now rely on a salaried 
production staff of five, a rotating corps of part timers and contractors, and a growing cohort of 
**Harvard** graduate students, undergraduates and interns whom we train in the public-facing 
humanities. Growing fast, in 2016 we more firmly established **Verse Video Education** as a nimble 
and stable producer of humanities-based content (now including an archive of over 120 separate 
interviews with distinguished discussants), while also defining a forward-looking partnership and 
growth strategy with **Harvard**. As 2016 draws to a close, I have much progress to report. 
**Verse Video Education**: Independent 501c3 
In **April 2016**, **Verse Video Education**, the fledgling production company I'd founded in 2014, 
received IRS approval and became a 501c3. Now capable of accepting philanthropic contributions, 
**Verse Video Education** has also begun to generate revenue by producing high-quality educational 
media for other institutions. Clients within our first year included ****Greenwich Country Day** School**, 
**YIVO Institute** for Jewish Research, Schlesinger Library, **Harvard** Institute for **Global Health**, and 
Project Zero. While philanthropic donations remain essential, work for clients allows us to amplify the 
impact of philanthropic donations, not only permitting additional investment in our flagship 
partnerships with WGBH and **Harvard**, but also fostering development of new partnerships and 
projects. These include a video series on poetry and science now running with award-winning 
magazine Nautilus, a collaboration with distinguished poet Robert Pinsky and his Favorite Poem 
Project, and an expansion of our poetry film series with partners at **The Nantucket Project**. Advised 
by a stellar and diversely talented board, **Verse Video Education** is looking toward sustainability. We 
are now discussing distribution of new content with a variety of stakeholders, including media 
providers in China.

New **Harvard** Partner: Bok Center for Teaching and Learning 
Meanwhile, Poetry in **America** has deepened its partnership and formulated a plan for growth going 
forward at **Harvard**. **this fall**, **Harvard**'s Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Mike Smith, 
endorsed the integration and expansion of my public-facing humanities work within the Derek Bok 
Center for Teaching and Learning. As a Bok Fellow **this year**, and alongside Bok director Rob Lue in 
**the years** to come, I will be working to substantially expand Bok's capacity and resources to train 
humanists in **21st-century** methods of public engagement-- developing courses, digital fellowship 
opportunities and also securing distribution outlets and partners for content produced in Bok by 
**Harvard** humanists. By **next year** at this time, I will be turning some of my attention beyond poetry 
(my favorite, but hardly the only humanistic mode of communication!) to create a wider base of 
humanities materials for use in American schools and other institutions. We will begin integrating and 
anchoring Poetry in **America** content (on art, sport and play; on the environment; and on health and 
well being) with content created by others. As I continue to experiment with use of digital media 
within my residential courses for undergraduates and graduates, I shall also be working with other 
faculty and graduate students. My work at Bok will also facilitate collaborations between humanists 
working across the whole universi
