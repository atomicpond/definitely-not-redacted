Hi **Martin**, 
Just wanted to check if you've seen the previous email. 
If it's more convenient for you to discuss it by **Skype**, let me know. If you want to skip any of them it's not a 
problem.

Hi **Martin**, 
Thanks for the great call **last week**. Enjoyed it a lot. Could I ask you some follow up questions? 
Question to be answered by **Martin**. 
• What specifically did **Epstein** fund that allowed you to make an advancement in applying math to 
complicated systems, right? 
• Is there a paper you're about to publish? Something in peer review? That might come out in Nature or 
Science? 
• The area you work on seems to be an attractive area of science, is it hard to secure funding? 
• Who are the greatest critics of your ideas on evolution? (is it EO Wilson?) have things evolved since 
**2010**? 
• What is it you think the public just does not understand about your work? 
• What is it that the media gets wrong about your work and science in general (i know of only one 
journalist with a degree in applied math, and most have never even taken calculus) 
• How has funding for your field and for you changed under Trump? 
Question 
• Would you be ok with the angle about how much scientist should care about where their funding comes 
from? It's a hot topic given this story
