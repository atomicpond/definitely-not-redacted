Jeffrey....how much do you know about this? 
When can I call you **tomorrow**? I know nothing but have friends at **Netflix**. 
Eleanora Kennedy called me **today**....out of the blue...and told me the film makers wanted to talk to me. I 
know director Joe Berlinger, not well, but may have done a screening on one of his films. Would have to 
check. 
I am around all day **tomorrow**.

Dear Peggy, 
My good friend Eleanore reached out to you on my behalf and I appreciate you wanting to hear 
more about this project. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 017827 
I am a TV journalist who covered the Epstein story for **several years** and wrote a best selling book 
about him with James Patterson in **2016**. 
Jim Patterson and I are now consulting on a four hour **Netflix** documentary series tentatively set to 
air towards **the end of the year**. 
The showrunner, Lisa Bryant, is working with director Joe Berlinger whose work I am sure you are 
familiar with, to produce a fair and balanced, in-depth recounting of the Epstein saga that, as you 
know, has every possible dramatic angle and is a story like no other. 
We thought of you because of your remarkable reputation in the public relations and show business 
world and the fact that you were an acquaintance of Jeffrey Epstein. 
The tawdry side of the story has been told...We hope you can give us some insight and context into 
who he was before his life fell apart. 
I am sure that Lisa Bryant,Joe Berlinger and Jim Patterson would all make themselves available to 
get on a call with you **this week**. 
Jim is in **Florida**,and Joe is traveling overseas for his Ted Bundy film. 
Lisa is in New York and would be happy to meet you in person as would I. 
Thanks for giving this your consideration. 
Best, 
Tim Malloy
