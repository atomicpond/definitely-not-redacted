Subject: ****Jane Doe** 
Brad** — 
In your answers to ROGS, you list **Milton Center** for girls as facility that **Jane Doe** attended. **Milton Center** is a 
**Department of **Juvenile Justice**** facility; therefore I will need to get her records from DJJ. DJJ will not release the records 
without a signed release by **Jane Doe**. I have attached a general HIPPA release for your review. Would you please have 
**Jane Doe** sign it? DJJ does not have a standard form. 
Also, will you agree to one more week on Responses to **Net Wirth** ROGS?? 
Please let me know.
