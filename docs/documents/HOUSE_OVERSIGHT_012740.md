﻿HED: To Venice With Love, **Peggy Siegal**

DEK: Back to northern Italy to take in the arts and architecture—and of course, film at the 68th annual Venice **Film Festival**. 


By: **Peggy Siegal**


Tuesday, Aug. 30, 2010


Art collector, polo player and film producer Peter Brant gives me a ride to the 68th Venice **Film Festival** to mingle with **Hollywood** glitterati from around the world. Venice, the thousand-year-old city looks like a movie set floating on the water that has been the backdrop for films from Casanova to The Tourist. **this year**, 65 films will have world premieres. Among the jury are two American directors: chairman Darren Aronosfky, Todd Haynes and one English musician, David Byrne.

I check into the paparazzi-proof Cipriani's on the private Giudecca Island for a week—a safe haven for George Clooney, Al Pacino and **Gwyneth Paltrow**. Cipriani's is impossible to book I have been told for months that Friday night is sold out.


In Italy, George Clooney, aka “King George,” is presiding over his Ides of March press conference at the Palazzo del Casino on Lido. He rules himself out of a future role as **United States** President, citing ****Barack Obama**'s** troubles are reason enough to avoid the job. How many countries can George rule? 


Clooney currently serves as producer, director, co-writer and actor. He seriously tries to explain why his film now reflects the present cynical political mood of the country. The press cannot help asking silly questions and setting George up for one wisecrack after another. 


Also on the panel are producer Grant Heslov and Beau Willimon who wrote the play the film is based on, Farragut North. Paul Giamatti, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood are confident they are sensational in this Machiavellian, political thriller and try not to joke around. George's infectious humor prevails and the conference is reduced to a Friars roast.


Ryan Gosling, last seen in Blue Valentine, who is filming in the states, is finally **this year**’s breakout star stealing Clooney’s film. 


At the premiere on the Lido at the Palazzo del Cinema, Marco Muller, artistic director of the festival, greets 50-year-old heartthrob Clooney with 45-year-old bombshell Cindy Crawford dressed in long bright red Roberto Cavalli gown exactly matching the red carpet. **23-year-old** Evan Rachel Wood steps out in a white Alessandra Rich gown, slit all the way up the middle, exposing her endless legs.  


Royal George later holds court with his cast back at Cipriani's. Attempting to handle the sweltering humidity, ties are loosened, drinks are poured while Evan Rachel Wood takes the microphone with a back-up jazz quartet belting out Janis Joplin songs. She transforms herself into a gyrating, pulsating soul sister as Robin Wright, Christoph Waltz, Diane Kruger and Sir Norman Foster watch in awe. Remember, Evan sang in Julie Taymor's Across the Universe.


By 2 a.m. Ms. Wood is drenched and jumps into Cipriani's Olympic-size pool to cool off in her borrowed gown. She has the dress cleaned **the next day** and sends it back good as new.

George heads for the 38th **Telluride **Film Festival**** to attend his tribute program introduced by Ken Burns. Fox Searchlight premieres Alexander Payne's Hawaiian-set The Descendants. George stars as a father of two who learns about his wife's infidelity. You have to love the role-reversal casting. Nobody cheats on George—which is why his performance is so poignant. 


Clooney and Payne met at the Toronto **Film Festival** ****two years** ago** and were shooting in Oahu months later. Payne edited the film at Clooney's Italian villa on Lake Como, where the entire cast, including **Charlie Rose** who has a cameo playing **Charlie Rose**, end up for a holiday reunion the weekend before **this year**’s festival. 


Activities include George and Grant challenging Charlie and Marisa Tomei to a strenuous game of hoops on the private basketball court. Late-night partying ends with Mr. Rose skinny-dipping in Lake Como—a tradition started by that wild and crazy guy Walter Cronkite **years ago**.


The Weinstein Company screens in Venice and Telluride their silent film The Artist, directed by Michel Hazanavicius and starring French movie idol Jean Dujardin. The film was premiered in May at the Cannes **Film Festival**.  


Early Oscar buzz for films and male lead performances could be The Descendants, The Artist and Shame. This momentum has to sustain itself on the long road to Eddie Murphy's opening dialogue on Oscar night in February.


Next to Evan Rachel Wood’s favorite pool, I am lunching and munching on pasta and pizza with Valentino, **Giancarlo Giammetti**, Bruce Hoeksema, Charlene de Ganay and Carlos Souza aka “the family.”


Paul Giamatti, whose family changed their spelling, tells me he is actually related to Valentino's business partner **Giancarlo Giammetti**, which is a visual stretch of the imagination. 


Valentino has brought his yacht T.M. Blue One carrying six pug
