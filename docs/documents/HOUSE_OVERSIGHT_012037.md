Subject: Press: AmLaw Litigation Daily on ****Emirates** Bank** win 
I'll soon send a cleaner version of this and other coverage, but wanted to share the article just posted in the 
AmLaw Litigation Daily. A personal thanks to Dan for speaking to the reporter, and Nima for feeding us case 
documents and insights. 
http://m.litigationdaily.com/#/article/1202765052511/1/A%20Master%20at%20Work:%20Dissecting%20the 
%20Closing%20Argument%20in%20Latham's%20Huge%20Win%20for%20Middle%20Eastern%20Bank  
A Master at Work: Dissecting the Closing Argument in **Latham**'s Huge Win for **Middle Eastern** Bank 
Jenna Greene08/14/2016 
For **Latham** & Watkins, defending a **Middle Eastern** bank accused of stealing trade secrets from a plucky 
American entrepreneur could have been a tough sell to a federal jury in **Orange County**, **California**. 
[http://www.law.com/image/LitDaily/DailyDicta.jpg]The stakes were high--more than half a billion dollars in 
damages--and some of the facts were, ahem, challenging. 
How did **Latham** lawyers turn a potentially unsympathetic narrative into a unanimous win for Dubai-based 
****Emirates** NBD** Bank PJSC on **Thursday**? 
A look at closing arguments by **Latham** partner Kathryn Ruemmler, who made her first in-court appearance 
since she stepped down as ****White House**** counsel in 2014, is revealing in a watch-the-master-at-work kind of 
way. 
Along with **Latham** partners Daniel Schecter and Dean Dunlavey, she faced off against an equally formidable 
opponent: Boies, Schiller & Flexner partner William Isaacson, who wasnamed a litigator of the 
year<http://www.americanlawyer.com/id= 1202745123270/Litigator-of-the-Year-William-Isaacson-of-Boies-
Schiller> by The American Lawyer in 2015. 
Ruemmler parachuted into the case on **May 20**, replacing Steven Bauer. He had another case (on behalf of 
Pacific Gas & Electric<http://www.therecorder.com/id=1202764714611/Split-Verdict-in-PGE-Pipeline-Blast-
Case?slreturn=20160712215338>) going to trial at the same time and couldn't convince U.S. District Judge 
James Selna to push back the trial date, which had already been delayed several times. 
This was the lay of the land: Two weeks before, **the ******Los Angeles** Times****** on May 8 had run a lengthy 
feature<http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-**InfoSpan**-lawsuit-20160508-story.html> that was distinctly 
sympathetic to the plaintiff, **Farooq Bajwa**. A former computer components manufacturer/ El Pollo Loco 
franchise owner, his latest venture was a company called **InfoSpan** Inc. 
Bajwa is portrayed as a visionary who had an idea to allow foreign workers to easily and cheaply send funds 
back to relatives in their home country via the internet or cell phone. 
"I realized I might make a big difference in this world not only helping these underprivileged people who don't 
have bank accounts, I will also be helping bring an economic revolution," Bajwa, 64, told the paper. "I had 
very big dreams." 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012038 
But after he struck a deal with ****Emirates** NBD** to roll out his product, **SpanCash**, he claimed the bank stole his 
proprietary technology, killed the deal and ruined his company. (Though it's hard to feel too sorry for him--
he's pictured in front of his house, a mansion that would put Versailles to shame. In this David-and-Goliath 
story, he's a David from the 1 percent.) 
Bajwa sought $554 million plus punitive damages on trade secret misappropriation and misrepresentation 
claims. 
Trial began on July 26 in U.S. ****District Court**** for Central District of **California**. On Aug. 10, Ruemmler and 
Isaacson summed up their opposing positions in closing arguments. 
Let's take a look. 
I Isaacson, who did not respond to a request for comment, led with one of his strongest cards: USA! USA! 
"We as a country, made up of flawed people, come together as o
