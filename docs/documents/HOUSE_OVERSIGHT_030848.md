**The **J.P. Morgan** View**
Local forces are dominating
� Asset allocation –– Local risks and opportunities trump global forces in
driving investment opportunities. Cross-market correlations to remain much
lower than in **recent years**.
� Economics –– US activity data are coming in better than hoped, but we
need another 1-2 months to see how consumers are responding to higher
taxes.
� Fixed Income –– Search for carry to trump Euro area jitters over time.
� Equities –– Japan remains our main country overweight.
� Credit –– We OW covered bonds in the Euro periphery over senior bank
bonds and subordinated vs senior bank bonds in the core.
� Currencies –– Cyprus to have minimal further impact on EUR, but a ECB
rate cut would push it a few cents lower versus the dollar.
� Commodities –– Stay long Brent and short gasoline.
� US stocks continue to gain, with the benchmark S&P500 breaching its
all time high level today in a gentle fashion. Bonds are generally up this
week on dovish comments from both the Fed and the BoJ. Commodities
have gained also, but credit remains the troubled asset class with spreads
wider in most markets, especially in EM external debt.
� Our overall investment theme remains that there is no overarching
global investment theme anymore this year but instead a number of
unrelated local forces that have largely local impact. The generalized
asset reflation we saw last year, with risk premia coming down consistently
across the globe and asset classes, was due to a gradual fading of tail risks
that has since been largely completed. “Risk-on, risk- off is so last year”.
� In addition, we are seeing no momentum either way in global growth,
price or earnings expectations that could put us into a bullish or bearish
growth story. Our 2.4% projection for 2013 world economic growth is
unchanged since November. YTD activity data for the world are tracking
our 2.6% forecast for Q1, comfortably up from the dismal 1.6% in Q4 of last
year. Amidst offsetting up- and downside surprises in the US and Japan
versus Europe, there has been no reason yet to raise the growth profile for
the year as a whole. We hope, but need evidence first.
� Without a global growth or fading-of-tail-risks force, we are left with a set
of local issues and opportunities that are having a local impact, at the
regional, asset class and company level, that should leave the rest of the
world largely unmoved. In this environment, correlations across regions
and risk markets should remain significantly lower than in **past years**.
Various markets may seem to behave “inconsistently” with others, but we
caution against expecting simple mean reversion, given our view of the
reduced impact of global factors. Active investors should pay more attention
to local fundamentals while long-term investors can expect to achieve
greater gains from cross-market and international diversification.

Local issues must be monitored and understood, though, to decide how to
allocate capital and risk. Just to review a few, Japanese policy makers
continue to present a concerted plan to reflate their economy through
monetary, fiscal and structural measures. The strong control of the
government and its high approval rating are steadily raising the chance of
success. We stay overweight Japanese equities and grow wary of the short yen
trade, as capital inflows and rising growth expectations (chart of right) are
ultimately bullish for the currency. Watch next week’s BoJ meeting, led by
newly appointed Governor Kuroda, for new reflationary measures.
The Euro area economy remains in recession, while policy makers are
making little effort to reverse the contraction. We monitor signs of any large
deposit flight post Cyprus over **coming weeks** and months to judge whether
the bailout may actually be worsening conditions in the Euro. Economi
