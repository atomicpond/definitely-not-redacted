**the Food and Drug Administration** has approved Praluent, a new medicine to lower cholesterol in people who 
have established heart disease, for people whose risk of a heart attack or stroke is not being adequately 
controlled by existing drugs called statins. 
It might be a big step in the battle against heart disease — and the approval is a triumph for **Regeneron** 
Pharmaceuticals, the Tarrytown, N.Y.-based biotechnology company that invented it. Praluent is likely to be 
more widely used, and to cost more, than Wall Steet analysts expected. That also means it could be a big cost 
down the line. 
"Obviously, the class is one of the biggest developments in cardiology in **the last decade**, that will allow us to 
treat patients who have been extremely difficult to treat with high levels of LDL cholesterol," says Steven 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025888 
Nissen, chairman of cardiology at **the **Cleveland Clinic****. "It's very promising." 
But it will also be very expensive, say Troy Brennan, the chief medical officer of CVS Caremark, the giant 
pharmacy benefits manager."If these drugs are used as broadly as they could be used, they are going to be by far 
the most expensive drug class," Brennan says. 
Praluent, an injection, lowers low-density lipoprotein, the so-called "bad cholesterol", by as much as 60%, far 
more than the statin drugs alone. It is the first drug to work by targeting a protein called PCSK9. Mutations in 
the gene that makes it can result in patients having lower cholesterol and a dramatically lower lifetime risk of 
heart attacks. A rival medicine from **Amgen** is also expected to be approved soon. The **FDA** is clearing Praluent 
for patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic condition that causes high cholesterol, 
and for people who have heart disease, like those who've had heart attacks or strokes, who are already taking 
the maximum dose of a statin they can tolerate. 
**Regeneron** and its marketing partner **Sanofi** say Praluent will have a wholesale cost of $40 a day, or $14,600 a 
year, for either of two doses, 75 milligrams or 150 mgs. It's likely that insurance companies will get a 
significant discount, because **Amgen** and **Regeneron** will compete by giving the insurers rebates.

"We don't want the noise about these drugs to be price," says Leonard Schleifer, the chief executive and 
founder of **Regeneron**. "We have to make sure that people get access to the drug for a fair price if they're 
insured, for free if they're not insured, or at a discount if they're under-insured." 
Praluent's price is 46% higher than that forecast by Evercore ISI, an investment bank, and it is being approved 
for a larger group of patients than many Wall Street analysts expected following a meeting convened by the 
**FDA** to analyze the data on the drug. Some doctors argued its use should be restricted mainly to patients with 
FH. But Mark Schoenebaum, Evercore ISI's pharmaceutical analyst, says that investors were initially 
disappointed because they had hoped the **FDA** would greenlight the drug for an even broader group. **Regeneron** 
shares were down 2.5% in afternoon trading before they were halted pending news. 
But doctors may prescribe the drug more widely than the label suggests. A survey of physicians published this 
morning by Geoffrey Porges, an biotechnology analyst at investment bank Sanford C. Bernstein, found that they 
would use the drug in 30% to 40% of patients who had already had heart attacks. He wrote that **2020** sales of 
Praluent could be as high as $4.8 billion.
