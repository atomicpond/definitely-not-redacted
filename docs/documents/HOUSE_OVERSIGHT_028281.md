**The House of the** Nobleman
Old Masters are hung in the company of some of the most notorious contemporary artists on the block in a show
opposite Frieze Art Fair
Text by John-Paul Pryor
For what is a man profited, if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul? Perhaps this is one question that
could be asked of any billionaire art collector. In **The House of the** Nobleman, artist ****WOLFE VON** LENKIEWICZ**
examines our relationship to art and the role of the supposedly worldly or noble collector from a nonjudgemental
critical distance, and exhibits art both old and new (from Manet and Cézanne to The Chapmans and
Damien Hirst) in a show that promises to prove contentious. Here, Lenkiewicz’s own “resequenced” Picassos will
be exhibited against their original counterparts, effectively folding art history in upon itself to create an entirely
new kind of dialogue. Dazed Digital went down to his studio to talk nobility, history and the reasons why a lost
battle is a battle one thinks one has lost.
Dazed Digital: What is the concept that informs **The House of the** Nobleman?
****WOLFE VON** LENKIEWICZ**: When I started to plan the exhibition with the co-curator **Victoria Golembiovskaya** (by
whom I was fascinated because she was instrumental in manoeuvring a submarine in the grand canal in Venice), I
began to think about the notion of quality in **the 21st century** as opposed to the set of values pursued by Marsilio
Ficino. The dislocation and decertification of a stable position in the world, which was formally the aristocrat, the
king… the **Noble Man**. The artist, being perceived at the centre, was seen as a God, and within Ptolemaic
concentric rings one moved from dog, to angel, to God. This is a hierarchical linear model, which has been
attractive for five centuries in one form or another. The idea of this show is to explore a post-humanist form of
compassion – the world is dynamically changing, and no matter how flexible our map may be to quantify it, we
will be in an eternal struggle with meaning.

**The House of the** Nobleman
Posted: 14 **October 2010** by Sarah Greenberg, RA Magazine Editor
Most people selling a property try to make it seem welcoming by brewing coffee and - at a stretch – baking bread.
But in a world gone mad for property and art, the stakes have been raised. How about a house that's been
'staged' (as they say Stateside) with a built-in art collection, including an eclectic array of work from Picasso to
Grayson Perry, Rodin to Richter, Manet to, predictably, Murakami, the artist who famously emblazoned his
designs on Louis Vuitton bags.
Yes, the £29m budget is a bit steep, but it needn't put you of from booking a tour to see this renovated mansion
in ****Cornwall Terrace**** that has been curated by Victoria Golemblovskaya and artist ****WOLFE VON** LENKIEWICZ**, with the
participation of the Saatchi Collection and **Channel 4**.
Exhibition open until 20 October, 11am – 6pm, by appointment only
