HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012197 
First Assistant U.S. Attorney 
DELIVERY BY FACSIMILE  
Jay P. Lefkowitz, Esq. 
**Kirkland & Ellis LLP** 
Citigroup Center 
153 East 53rd Street • 
New York, New York 10022-4675 
Re: Jeffrey Epstein 
**U.S. **Department of Justice**** 
United States Attorney 
Southern District of Florida 
99 PIE. 4 Street 
Miami, FL 33132 
(305) 961-9100 
May 19, 2008 
Dear Mr. Lefkowitz, 
I am in receipt of your e-mail dated May 19, 2008 to the United States Attorney. The U.S. 
Attorney would like me to advise you that all communications and inquiries related to the Epstein 
matter, will be handled by AUSA Marie Villafana and/or her supervisor, Karen Atkinson, so he does 
not intend to respond to your e-mail or calls unless AUSA Villafana and/or her supervisors advise 
him otherwise. Furthermore, you make reference to "our July 8 deadline." Respectfully, the United 
States Attorney's **Office for **the Southern District** of Florida** ("SDFL") has never agreed to any such 
deadline. Should you decide to provide the SDFL with any additional information, please do so 
through AUSA Villafana, and, in her absence, AUSA Atkinson. 
On **September 24, 2007**, your client, Jeffrey Epstein, in consultation with Gerald Lefcourt, 
Esq. and Lilly Ann Sanchez, Esq., as well as numerous other nationally-renowned lawyers, including 
but not limited to Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, former Independent Counsel and 
Solicitor General of the United States Kenneth Starr, just to name a few, entered into a global 
resolution of state and federal liabilities faced by your client ("the Agreement") with the SDFL. 
Although you and other members of the defense team have since claimed that the Agreement was 
the product of adhesion, the following facts demonstrate that Epstein knowingly and voluntarily 
entered into the Agreement in order to avoid a federal indictment regarding his sexual conduct 
involving minor victims. Despite the fact that by signing the Agreement, Epstein gave up the right 
to object to its provisions, the SDFL bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider 
your objections. Since these objections have finally been exhausted and Epstein has previously 
expressed his intent to not comply with several of the terms and conditions of the Agreement as set 
forth below, the SDFL hereby notifies you that unless he complies with all of the terms and 
conditions of the Agreement, as modified by the United States Attorney's December 19,2007 letter 
to Ms. Sanchez by close of business on Monday, June 2, 2008, the SDFL will elect to terminate the 
Agreement.

Background 
The Agreement was the product of months of negotiations. Specifically, you requested and 
received numerous meetings, at the highest levels of the SDFL and DOJ's Child Exploitation and 
Obscenity Section (CEOS) concerning claims that (a) the investigation merely produced evidence 
of relatively innocuous sexual conduct with some minors who, unbeknownst to Epstein, 
misrepresented their ages; (b) the authorities investigating Epstein engaged in misconduct; (c) the 
contemplated federal statutes have no applicability to this matter; and (d) the federal authorities 
disregarded the fundamental policy against federal intervention with state criminal proceedings. 
After careful review, the SDFL ultimatelyrejected those claims. Subsequent to its decision, however, 
but before proceeding any further, the SDFL provided you with 30 days to appeal the decision to the 
Assistant Attorney General of the United States, Alice Fisher. As you recall, you chose to forego an 
appeal to AAG Fisher, and instead pursued a negotiated resolution which, ultimately, resulted in the 
execution of the Agreement. 
The Negotiation Phase 
During negotiations, you tried to avoid a resolution that called for incarceration and 
registration as a sexual offender — both of which would be triggered by a successful federal 
prosecution. The SDFL believed and continues to believe that should this matter proceed to trial, 
your client would be convicted of the federal statutes identified in the Agreement. In order to achieve 
a global resolution, the SDFL indicated a willingness to defer to the State the length of incarceration; 
however, it remained adamant that Epstein register as a sex offender and that all victims identified 
during the investigation remain eligible for compensation. In order to achieve this result, the parties 
considered two alternatives, a plea to federal charges that limited Epstein's sentencing exposure, or, 
as suggested by you, a plea to state charges encompassing Epstein's conduct. Ultimately, the parties 
agreed to, inter alio, a plea to the state charges outlined in the Agreement, registration and a method 
of compensation. 
The Agreement 
The crux of the Agreement defers in favor of the State federal prosecution of Epstein for his 
sexual conduct involving those minor victims i
