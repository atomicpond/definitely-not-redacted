Inference: International Review of Science
Feedback & Comments
Robert Berwick
Professor of Computational Linguistics and **Computer Science** and Engineering at **MIT**.
“I am truly delighted that you and others have started publishing such a journal as Inference,
which touches on so many of my own concerns and interests - I have been meaning for **years** to
write articles on evolutionary theory (some like the fine ones you’ve already published); on big
data and its discontents (I have one on the deep troubles with deep learning); on the sloppy
connectome neuroscience (which you’ve covered); and so on - in fact, many of the topics on your
“hit list”. Your abbreviations alone are priceless.”
Simon Blackburn
Professor of Philosophy at **the University of **Cambridge****.
“Many thanks for the new issue link and for the prompt payment. Unusual in the publishing
world.”

with Inference and I do hope to contribute again in the future.”
