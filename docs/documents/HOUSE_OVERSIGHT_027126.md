**Breaking News** 
**Summers** withdraws from **Fed** race 
**Lawrence **Summers**** has taken himself out of the running to be the 
next chair of **the **Federal Reserve****, withdrawing his name after 
opposition from key Democratic senators indicated they would 
oppose his nomination. 
Mr **Summers**, a former ****Treasury** Secretary** and senior economic 
adviser to **Barack Obama** in his first term, galvanised opposition 
among left-of-centre Democrats who painted him as symbol of the 
wrongs of financial deregulation.
