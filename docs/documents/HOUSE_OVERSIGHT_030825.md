## Document Text

```
﻿In **March 2011** tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in **Syria**. The protestors were demanding political reforms, dissatisfied with the cruel and authoritarian regime of **Bashar al-**Assad****, who has been in power for **more than ten **years****, succeeding his father after a **30-year** rule. The government responded by opening fire. Within **a few months**, a peaceful uprising grew into a full-scale civil war, which has lasted for **more than **two **years****** and is unlikely to end soon. This August, the death toll in **Syria** has reached 100,000. More than a quarter of the 22 million population has been displaced, hundreds of thousands of refugees have left the country. 

**the United States** has been supporting the opposition, supplying it with food and medical aid, but refraining from military intervention and from providing the rebels with weapons. The Obama administration claimed that the US would not intervene unless it had strong evidence of chemical weapons used by the **Assad** regime. In ****June** 2013**, **Washington** concluded that chemical weapons, including nerve agent sarin, classified by **the United Nations** as a weapon of mass destruction, had been used. **the White House** announced for the first time in **June** that it was going to send weapons to the opposition. **Congress** vetoed this resolution. 

There are many reasons why the US should refrain from providing the opposition with weapons. Over the **two **years**** of military confrontation, the situation on the ground has become increasingly chaotic. It is important to understand that there is no united opposition capable of overthrowing / toppling **Assad**’s regime. Instead, there are different military groups, using terrorist methods against the government forces, as well as against each other. The most prominent of them, the Free Syrian Army, is not strong enough to defeat **Assad**’s forces. Even if the US provides the **FSA** with light weapons, this opposition group is outnumbered by hundreds of thousands against **Assad**’s army. Even according to the most exaggerated estimates, the size of the **FSA** does not exceed 20,000 soldiers, while **Assad**’s army counts as many as 400,000, equipped with heavy and sophisticated weapons. 

Due to the uprising, different extremist military groups have been able to cross the border and enter **Syria**. One of the leading armed groups, Al-Nusra Front, an affiliate of the world’s largest terrorist organizations **al-Qaeda**, has been included by the US in the international terrorism blacklist. It is important to note that these rebels have many supply channels, making it impossible for the US to control which group will be receiving the weapons, creating the risk of the US arms being used by terrorists against **America** or its allies in the region. 

Moreover, after **two **years**** of fighting against the regime, the opposition forces have started to turn guns on each other, fighting for power and territory. This significantly undermines their ability to form a united government, decreasing the probability of a strong alternative force. Providing military groups with weapons will only escalade the violence, lead to more massacre and destruction. 

More importantly, even if the **Assad**’s regime is overthrown, the opposition is unlikely to succeed in forming a stable and functional democratic government. Admittedly, **Bashar **Assad**** has made immense mistakes since the beginning of the war. Human rights have been viciously violated, tens of thousands of people, including civilians, have been killed. But it appears that there is no better alternative at the moment than **Assad** remaining in power. Once the regime is overthrown, the power vacuum is inevitable. Removing Mr. **Assad** is just a tiny part of a long and troublesome process. If history is any guide, overthrowing a dictatorship is just the very first step. Ouster of Muammar Quaddafi in **Libya** was supposed to bring democracy and stability. Instead, the country is more destabilized than ever. **two **years**** after the revolution, a significant part of **Libya** remains under the control of the militias, the armed groups who did not cease power even after the parliamentary elections and continue to use force against the government. 

The situation is even worse in **Iraq**, where **al-Qaeda** has been expanding its power again. The past four months have been among the bloodiest since **2008**, with death toll reaching 3,000. The **al-Qaeda** affiliate, The Islamic State of **Iraq**, started conducting terrorist attacks, not only against the government forces and Shia mosques, but also the civilians, further destabilizing the week government. The Islamic State of **Iraq** has become one of the most prominent military groups fighting in **Syria**. The terrorist groups are trying to destabilize and debase **Syria**, which would give them an opportunity to create there a platform to plan international terrorist attacks. If the opposition forces gain control of the country, this scenario is almost inevitable. Subsequently, the conflict in **Syria** is dramatically impacting its neighboring
