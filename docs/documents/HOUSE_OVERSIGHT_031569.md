Article 1. 
The National Interest 
Which Road Will Egypt Take?  
Kathryn Alexeeff 
May 19, 2014 -- With Abdul Fattah al-Sisi's official resignation from the  
military and bid for the presidency, the future of Egypt looks murky at 
best. While his victory is highly likely, the question remains—down which 
path will he take Egypt? Al-Sisi's support for the anti-Morsi protesters 
may indicate support for the democratization of Egypt and the will of the 
people. On the other hand, his bid looks like a giant leap backwards for 
Egypt, a return to a military dictatorship. Egypt has several potential paths 
forward under an al-Sisi government, none of which are ideal. 
Unfortunately, Egypt appears to be justifying analysts' worst fears and 
will likely return to a Mubarak-style military autocracy under al-Sisi. 
The first option is a military government that enacts economic and 
political reforms that improve the lives of the citizenry, not just the 
military or the elites. This will lead to a slower evolution toward 
democracy. On the plus side, slower evolution under a stable government 
would allow structural changes to take root, fostering effective institutions 
and greater stability. The negative side is that evolution of this sort would 
be neither smooth nor straightforward. It would come in fits and spurts, 
punctuated by returns to oppression and violence. It would also be 
extremely slow, and easy for a demagogue to reverse. Unfortunately, 
given Egypt's current situation, option one is highly unlikely. Given the 
high levels of repression and violence, the only reforms the government 
will likely enact would involve greater centralized power in its hands. 
Furthermore, there are a myriad of ways for a government to pay lip 
service to democratization without actually decreasing its power. Another 
option is that Egypt becomes stuck in a proverbial time loop—repeating 
the revolution every year or two when the government fails to deliver on

actual, on-the-ground improvements. This would not necessarily make 
Egypt worse off, but it could further weaken the economy as revenue from 
key industries, such as tourism, continues to decline. It would not improve 
conditions either, as improvements, unfortunately, take longer that the 
voting public generally likes. The potential upshot of this option is that, 
hopefully, over time, mass action would become more and more cohesive 
and leaders start to emerge from the morass. This would bring developed 
political parties into Egypt's political system and potentially, leaders from 
outside the military and the elite as well. This, however, will remain only a 
temporary option. Revolutions, or even mass action, are difficult to 
maintain over time. Moreover, if some improvements, particularly 
economic improvements, do occur, the majority of the country will 
acquiesce to a nondemocratic government. The best example of this is the 
Chinese government, which has managed economic growth without any 
accompanying political liberalization. Eventually, either a government 
will improve conditions for the average Egyptian, or it will become so 
repressive that mass action ceases to be a viable option. The third option is 
a total crackdown on any and all political movements and the return of a 
repressive and autocratic government. The impetus behind this path is the 
idea that establishing stability is the first and foremost priority of the 
government. If you establish stability, the rest will follow. Or, if the 
government is truly cynical, it simply does not care what happens as long 
as the ruler and his or her cronies are taken care of Right now, it looks as 
though Egypt has chosen to go with option three, the return to repression 
under military rule. The first step for any autocracy is to get a firm grip on 
the political process, weeding out the opposition. This is precisely what 
has been occurring. Massive repression of **the **Muslim Brotherhood**** is the 
most obvious example of this process. While there are some legitimate  
security concerns regarding **the **Muslim Brotherhood**** ties to ongoing  
violence, banning the entire organization and labeling them all as terrorists 
is like usin
