Hello Peter. I am currently on a plane. I sent you earlier from the plane an email response to your letter, which 
I hope you received. Regarding your note below: My earlier remark to you was based on my correspondence 
with the universities during and after the investigation, and the conclusion I drew from the ANU report, which I 
quoted for you in my response to your note. The claims made in the allegation which were later demonstrated to 
be false, or which were then not supported after repeated requests from **The University** to substantiate the claim, 
provided evidence that the claim was fabricated (as I knew it must be), and therefore maliciously so. 
I had been planning on resigning my honorary appointment at ANU before I received the original letter from 
ANU because my wife had moved to the US **Several years ago**, and I no longer visited **The University** regularly 
to work with colleagues there as I did in earlier years. When I received the letter from ANU regarding the 
complaint, I decided to wait to resign my appointment until the investigation was completed and the complaint 
was dismissed. After it was, I sent my note of resignation in, and I note that upon its receipt the Dean he 
suggested I remain on until my appointment expired at **the end of this year**, but as I had made my decision to 
resign earlier I felt no need to wait until then. I received a very nice note from the director of the unit I work 
with (who was made aware of the complaint and its resolution by the Dean) who expressed thanks for my many 
contributions to **The University** while there, and my interactions with staff, students, and faculty there. 
I hope this clarifies your issues.

Dr. Krauss, 
Since sending the note below, we have heard from **the **Australian National University****. They informed us: 
"The characterisation by Professor Krauss that **the **Australian National University**** (ANU) found the complaint 
to be 'unsubstantiated and fabricated with malicious intent' is false." 
They also told us that you resigned your honorary appointment at ANU on November 3. Can you comment on 
the reason for your resignation from ANU? 
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this with you. Again, we are planning on publishing our story 
Tuesday morning, **Eastern US Time**. Please provide any comments you wish us to consider before then. 
Sincerely, 
**Peter Aldhous**

Dr. Krauss: 
As you know, I'm a reporter for **BuzzFeed News** who has been investigating sexual misconduct allegations 
against you. As we've already discussed by email, I'd very much like to interview you about these allegations in 
detail. 
In particular, you stated in an email sent on Nov 13 that two universities had investigated an incident (# 6 
below). You claimed that "both Universities independently concluded that the report was unsubstantiated and 
fabricated with malicious intent." We are not aware that either university concluded fabrication or malicious 
intent, so if you have evidence to support this assertion, we would like to see and discuss it. 
**The story concerns your actions towards students while a professor of physics at **Case Western Reserve 
University****, as well as your conduct in non-academic settings as a prominent figure in the skeptics movement. I 
am reporting this story along with two of my colleagues on the science desk, **Azeen Ghorayshi** and **Virginia 
Hughes**. 
Our story is about several allegations of sexual misconduct dating from 2006 to 2016 (see full details below). 
Our reporting also goes into how the various institutions you have been affiliated with — Case Western, 
**Arizona State University**, **the **Australian National University****, **the New College of the Humanities**, and the Center 
for Inquiry, for which you serve as an honorary member of the board of directors — have handled complaints 
and concerns about your behavior during this time. 
Our story is corroborated by emails, university documents, official complaints, testimony from victims and 
eyewitnesses, and interviews with more than two dozen of your current and former academic colleagues, 
students, and peers in the skeptics movement. 
I wanted to offer you the opportunity to comment and/or respond to the main facts we plan to publish. If you 
wish to comment on any of the below findings, we need to hear from you as soon as possible. We are 
planning on publishing our story Tuesday morning, **Eastern US Time**. 
Based on our reporting, this is what we plan to publish: 
Incident 1: 
• In **November of 2006**, at an event launching the new **Center for Inquiry** in Washington D.C., you met a 
volunteer for CFI D.C. 
• At the event, you asked for her bu
