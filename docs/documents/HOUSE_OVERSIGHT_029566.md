this poem about childbirth and is not for children. 
It's for adults and it raises awareness on the issues of discrimination against women athletes in sports 
,and, against women of color in childbirth. These are **Serena**'s big issues now.

**Dear **Jeffrey****, 
Here is an invitation you can forward. Fingers crossed. 
I'm going upstairs to hunt for my copy of **Lolita**, or will get on my kindle and reread on our way to 
**Australia**. I may have lent it to one of my kids. I would recommend reading **My Antonia** by **Cather** next 
time you're on a long plane trip. The prose is gorgeous, and the book has-- come to think of it-- similar 
themes to **Lolita** in that it's about a man whose whole life is stamped forever by his impression of a young 
girl. 
Thank you for this help with **Serena**. I'm so sorry about what happened with WA. I will keep the "bootleg" 
episode and hope to release someday. It's so good, and he was so kind to read the poem with me and you 
were so kind to make it happen.
