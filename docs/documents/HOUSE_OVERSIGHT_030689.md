Importance: High 
Bannon's "nationalist-populist" platform is coherent, rational, and, apparently appealing to a great many people. 
I can't see why at this point he wouldn't want to use his world-stage stature to make an argument for it and to 
claim leadership of it. What does he have to lose? What else is there, except to suck up to **Trump**, and get the 
chance to be manhandled by him again?

All good. I am everybody's darling. Have to keep reminding people that I am actually quite unpopular. 
Apparently thing of the past--for now (excepting among a small circle of journalists). **Ira **Rosen****, a 60 Minutes 
producer and a friend of Bannon's, came with a message from SB: "You own me a few million." **Rosen** also 
says he believes SB now weighing the strategy of making a formal and public break with **Trump**. I can't get 
together **today** because I have to leave for DC at 11AM to speak to 800 book buyers (not to mention pre-
signing 800 books). Then **tomorrow** AM to LA to do **Bill Maher** show. Making money is hard work.
