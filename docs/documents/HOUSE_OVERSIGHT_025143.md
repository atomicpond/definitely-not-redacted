**Africa**, parasites, intelligence


To understand intelligence in the tropics, e.g. among dark-skinned Africans, you need to understand the importance of parasites—both as an environmental factor that exerts a negative effect on mental development and a positive effect on selection for biological diversity of all sorts, including intelligence. 

1.  Taking first the well-known negative effect of parasite load on individual intelligence—in the US the parallel factor is toxins and also indoor parasites, as in tenements—the US is now more segregated by race than it was in **1965** and so that many studies show that there is a strong tendency for whites to live in healthy environments and blacks inferior habitats. 

For **Africa**, the environmental factor is parasites—disease—known to exert a strong negative effect on intelligence. 

They also exert a very strong positive effect for genetic diversity in their hosts that may in turn select for some groups excelling in intelligence, even if the mean is lower—variance is higher.

2--Hominids have always emerged from **Africa**, erectus, sapiens, sapiens neanderthalensis and sapiens sapiens, but with trivial exceptions never in the reverse direction--why? Because **Africa** is the most genetically variable part of the world, especially the smaller the organism, hence parasites. African human populations are invariably more genetically variable than more temperate hominids, including today.

The same rule applies more generally, that is, to almost all species—migration is always tropics to temperate to **Arctic**, rarely the other way around (e.g. salamanders are the exception: temperate to tropics)—it is Mexicans and people further south who are coming into the US, not Canadians and Eskimos. So Trump is erecting a barrier against Darlington’s Rule—migration is always tropics outward.  **Africa** is the center of the tropics in the entire globe. Before that it was part of Gondwanaland (**Africa**, **South America**, Antarctic) but it was the center of that super-continent, and therefore most tropical section, so Darlington’s rule held back then, as we know from fossils. 




BTW it is striking that there is strong evidence that selection from parasites has been increasing over the past 40,000 years with an acceleration of positive selection to a striking degree—before agriculture and animal husbandry which added further acceleration associated with orders of magnitude (5 0r 6) increases in density. There are “signatures” that genes show of recent strong positive selection, basically comparing neutral sites (change in DNA has no effect on structure of associated protein) with non-neutral sites and seeing if the latter evolve while the former show a random walk. 

And what are the chief “selected variants”?  Parasite-resistant genes.

Now these are automatically selected when density increases because parasites LOVE density--consider people packed in a room breathing on each other, or water-born parasites traveling quickly to others, or vector-borne parasites, e.g. malaria--if one in ten humans are sick but widely dispersed a mosquito biting the sick person rarely passes on the Plasmodium but if dense, every tenth person gives it to the mosquito who quickly passes it on

Likewise parasites like mobility--which increases density of contacts--so Haitians acquired HIV-1 because their middle class served as the middle class of emerging French-speaking African nations with high HIV, and they brought back the disease with them when they returned (though of course not whatever HIV-resistant genes may have been selected among the Africans).

Divergent human populations often show very similar patterns of strong selection for genes though different in time--thus Europe and Yoruba-land showed similar peaks in parasite resistant selection, though 10,000 years ago in the former and 8500 in the latter

Incidentally very striking that cases of strong outbreeding, e.g between sapiens and neanderthalensis resulted in us acquiring ~3% of our genome from them, half were local-environment genes—fair skin, less hair on back, blue eyes and red hair on head—and half PARASITE-RESISTANT GENES (MHC genes).

Likewise interbreeding between 'us' and Denisovens in Tibet helped us acquire alleles uniquely suited for high altitude and, once again, resistance to local parasites.

Logic is obvious--if you are moving into Europe for the first time you are adapted to the parasites from which you came (malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, this that and the third African disease) but not those in the area you are invading (smallpox, the plague)

3--Human genetic diversity declines as people move from **Africa** outwards--why? Serial founder effect.  It is always a sub-group of the larger group that decides to go over the next mountain and colonize the valley. They can rapidly reconstitute numbers but not lost genetic diversity—repeated over and over you see a steady decline in genetic diversity from **Africa** to mid-East Europe Asia (**Russia**
