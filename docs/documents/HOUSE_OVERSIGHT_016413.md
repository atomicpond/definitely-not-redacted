Opportunity Zones 
image001.jpg; image002.jpg; image003.jpg; image004.jpg 
Importance: High 
Hope all well, are you doing anything around these or clients? 
In a former warehouse on a dimly lit street in the South Bronx, developers sipping Puerto 
Rican moonshine listened as a local official urged them to capture a new U.S. tax break by 
rebuilding the decaying neighborhood. 
In **Alabama**, a young lawyer quit his job after seeing the same tax break's potential to help 
one of the nation's poorest states. He now spends **his days** driving his Hyundai from town 
to town, slideshow at the ready, hoping to connect investors with communities. 
And on a conference call with potential clients, a prominent hedge fund executive pitched 
investments in a boutique hotel in **Oakland**, which he described as **San Francisco**'s 
**Brooklyn**. The project is eligible for the same tax break, designed to help the poor. 
Betting on Opportunity Zones 
Sales of development sites are surging in areas eligible for tax breaks

Fervor about opportunity zones is heating up across the U.S. For a limited time, investors 
who develop real estate or fund businesses in these areas are able to defer capital gains on 
profits earned elsewhere and completely eliminate them on new investments in 8,700 low-
income census tracts. The goal is to reinvigorate these areas. But the question is whether 
the **2017** tax law will, as **U.S. Treasury** Secretary Steven Mnuchin predicts, pump $100 
billion into places that need it most, or if investors will play it safe by funding projects in a 
few zones already on the upswing. 
QuicktakeWill 'Opportunity Zones' Help the Rich, the Poor or Both?  
There's no lack of optimism among officials in shrinking Rust Belt towns, wind-swept 
Western landscapes and hurricane-ravaged **Puerto Rico**, who hope to jump-start local 
economies. The incentives are so flexible they could be used for everything from affordable 
housing to solar farms. 
Yet on the investor side, much of the attention is fixed on how to turn a profit in already 
thriving areas. They include neighborhoods surrounding **Manhattan**, Atlantic beach towns  
drawing vacation-home developers, bedroom communities near **Silicon Valley** and 
anomalies like **Portland**, **Oregon**, where the entire downtown was deemed eligible for the 
breaks. 
"The phrase I keep thinking of is 'gold rush,' " said Michael Lortz, an accountant who 
works with developers in **Portland**. "There's a lot of money from out of town that's coming 
here." 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 016413 
Already, a policy debate is raging. Backers are urging people to reserve judgment and say 
the tax breaks have galvanized cities, businesses and investors to think creatively about 
boosting parts of the country most in need. Critics say the incentives were poorly 
calibrated and may amount to a boondoggle far in excess of the official $1.6 billion 
projected cost. 
Americans may have to wait **months** or years to learn which side is right. That's because 
the law doesn't require investors to disclose projects, making it difficult to tell which areas 
are benefiting the most. 
But there's plenty of evidence that a boom is brewing. **Goldman Sachs** Group Inc., which 
already had an investment team focusing on struggling communities, has disclosed about 
$150 million in projects in **recent **months****. Purchases of sites inside opportunity zones 
spiked as the tax law took effect, outpacing growth in other areas, according to Real 
Capital Analytics, which tracks property sales. Altogether, investors spent 62 percent more 
on properties eligible for tax breaks in the 12 **months** through September, compared with 
those in the same census tracts **a year earlier**, its data show. 
Here are snapshots of what's happening across **America**: 
Bronx Boost 
Port Morris Distillery, which makes a high-alcohol rum called pitorro, was the perfect spot 
for an opportunity zone pitch. It's on a block with a colorful mural, industrial buildings 
ready for loft conversions and views of the **Manhattan** skyline. Much of the surrounding 
South Bronx is now an opportunity zone. 
"We have always been the most ignored," Marlene Cintron, the borough's head of 
economic development, told an audience of developers and lawyers in **November**. "These 
opportunity zones are here for you to take advantage of them." 
The case for the Bronx, where incomes are among the lowest in **New York**, is that it's the 
last borough awaiting revitalization. The tax incentives are designed to unleash it. If 
developers can buy at current Bronx prices, before seeing a **Brooklyn**-like rise, the breaks 
would be massive.
