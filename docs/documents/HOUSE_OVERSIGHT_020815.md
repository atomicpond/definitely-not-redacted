• • The Department of **Justice** lost its latest battle with **Congress** **Thursday** when it agreed to brief House 
**Intelligence** Committee members about a top-secret **Intelligence** source that was part of the **FBI**'s 
investigation of the **Trump** campaign. Even without official confirmation of that source's name, the news so 
far holds some stunning implications. 
Among them is that **the **Justice** Department** and ****Federal Bureau** of Investigation** outright hid critical 
information from a congressional investigation. In a **Thursday** press conference, Speaker **Paul Ryan** bluntly 
noted that **Intelligence** Chairman Devin Nunes's request for details on this secret source was "wholly 
appropriate," "completely within the scope" of the committee's long-running **FBI** investigation, and 
"something that probably should have been answered a while ago." Translation: The department knew full 
well it should have turned this material over to congressional investigators **last year**, but instead deliberately 
concealed it. 
House investigators nonetheless sniffed out a name, and Mr. Nunes in **recent weeks** issued a letter and a 
subpoena demanding more details. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's response was to double 
down—accusing the House of "extortion" and delivering a speech in which he claimed that "declining to 
open the **FBI**'s files to review" is a constitutional "duty." **Justice** asked **the **White House**** to back its 
stonewall. And it even began spinning that daddy of all superspook arguments—that revealing any detail 
about this particular asset could result in "loss of human lives." 
This is desperation, and it strongly suggests that whatever is in these files is going to prove very 
uncomfortable to the **FBI**. 
The bureau already has some explaining to do. Thanks to the Washington Post's unnamed law-enforcement 
leakers, we know Mr. Nunes's request deals with a "top secret **Intelligence** source" of the **FBI** and **CIA**, who 
is a U.S. citizen and who was involved in the **Russia** collusion probe. When government agencies refer to 
sources, they mean people who appear to be average citizens but use their profession or contacts to spy for

the agency. Ergo, we might take this to mean that the **FBI** secretly had a person on the payroll who used his 
or her non-**FBI** credentials to interact in some capacity with the **Trump** campaign. 
This would amount to spying, and it is hugely disconcerting. It would also be a major escalation from the 
electronic surveillance we already knew about, which was bad enough. Obama political appointees 
rampantly "unmasked" **Trump** campaign officials to monitor their conversations, while the **FBI** played dirty 
with its surveillance warrant against **Carter Page**, failing to tell the Foreign **Intelligence** Surveillance Court 
that its supporting information came from the Hillary Clinton campaign. Now we find it may have also been 
rolling out human **Intelligence**, John Le Carr& style, to infiltrate the **Trump** campaign. 
Which would lead to another big question for the **FBI**: When? The bureau has been doggedly sticking wi
