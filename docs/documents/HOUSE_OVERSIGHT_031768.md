0 Photo by Gabe Ginsberg/Getty Images **stormy daniels** hit back with an insult of her own after President 
**Trump** called her "Horseface." President **Trump** on **Tuesday** called adult-film star **stormy daniels** "Horseface" 
and threatened to "go after" her after he won a court victory over his alleged mistress. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 031768 
"Federal Judge throws out Stormy DaniaIs [sic] lawsuit versus **Trump**. **Trump** is entitled to full legal fees.' 
@FoxNews Great, now I can go after Horseface and her 3rd rate lawyer in the Great State of **Texas**. She will 
confirm the letter she signed! She knows nothing about me, a total con!' he tweeted. 
The tweet comes **one day** after a federal judge in **California** threw out Daniels's defamation lawsuit against 
**Trump** and ordered Daniels to repay the president's legal fees. 
Daniels's attorney, Michael Avenatti, responded by calling **Trump** a "disgusting misogynist" and a "liar" who 
has dishonored his family and country. 
"You are a disgusting misogynist and an embarrassment to **the United States**. Bring everything you have, 
because we are going to demonstrate to the world what a complete shyster and liar you are. How many other 
women did you cheat on your wife with while you had a baby at home?" he tweeted.
