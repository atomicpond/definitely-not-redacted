We organize and conduct seminars with female speakers who are leaders in their industry.
Our seminal approach can me likened to “TED Talks for Women.” The speaker shares the secrets of her professional and personal success with the audience and answers the questions. The discussions will include, but won’t be limited to the following topics: How to pursue a career of your dream? What makes you feel empowered? How to build one of a kind brand? How to achieve both self-realization in professional life and fulfillment personal life?
