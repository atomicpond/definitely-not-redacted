Private equity has direct line to new administration

There's not just **Wilbur Ross** who will serve as **Commerce** Secretary, but also **Blackstone** (**NYSE**:BX) CEO 
Steve Schwarzman who will chair the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, and attorney Jay Clayton - who 
has advised on numerous major P-E deals - to lead the **SEC**. 
Aside from those official posts, the president-elect has met with the heads of **Carlyle Group** (NASDAQ:CG) 
and **KKR** since his election. 
"There seems to be more interest in the advice of real-world practitioners than in the past," says the head of the 
P-E industry's D.C. lobbying group. "This is encouraging." 
Indeed. Among P-E's top priorities is carried interest - one of the few things **Trump** and **CLINTON** agreed on 
during the campaign. Carried interest is currently taxed at 23.8% vs. the top ordinary income tax rate of 39.6%. 
Like **CLINTON**, **Trump** wanted carried interest taxed as ordinary income, though **Trump** would lower the top rate 
to 33%. Other tax law changes **Trump** is proposing could cut the effective tax rate further - perhaps to as low as 
25%, or just marginally higher than currently. 
Another big priority is retaining the tax deductibility of interest. **Trump** wants to give companies the ability to 
either keep that deduction or pass and gain the ability to immediately expense capital investment. A plan by 
**HOUSE** Republicans might not be as favorable.
