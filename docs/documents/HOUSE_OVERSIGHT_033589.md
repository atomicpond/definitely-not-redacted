A few things to think about: 
If the **Patterson** book is being published in **August**, that presents some time frame issues. You would not be 
able to do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In 
a sense, better that they know what **Patterson**'s position is and, **a year from now** say, be able to counter it. I 
have some thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience. 
That being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal 
opportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting 
you frame your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you 
decidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is 
about your willingness to do that. My view is that in **a couple of weeks** you could master message and 
technical proficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something 
along the lines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (**Charlie Rose**, I'd say), and 
perhaps some social media efforts. 
Speaking of which, again, I think a strategic plan, involving your public identity, philanthropic activities and 
interests, and the development of media allies, ought finally to be put in place. A big, comprehensive, 
expensive effort. 
The alternative is to continue to keep head down and hope **Patterson** book is just more he-said she-said and 
**Connolly** getting lost in the reeds (which, as an inveterate conspiracist, he always does). My worry is that 
**Patterson** can be counted on to produce a bestseller, and while he isn't regarded as a serious writer, he'll 
surely be unloading a lot of tabloid copy. Because this will be tied to the election, the Trump-Clinton angle will 
amp up the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've 
encountered before.

Meanwhile--
In a lawyer's letter, I'd suggest including the following points--not necessarily legal, but a warning about how a 
press campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media controversy 
than they are of legal threats): 
1) Little, **Brown** has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not 
publishing a book by **JAMES **Patterson**** about Jeffrey **Epstein**--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the 
questionable nature of the book; 
2) The actual author of the book, **john **Connolly****, is someone other than the stated author, **JAMES **Patterson****. 
**Connolly** is known to have developed an obsession with **Epstein**, such that, his longtime employer, ****Vanity Fair****, 
has refused to allow him to write about **Epstein** for the magazine; 
3) Sources have confirmed for us that **Patterson** has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book, 
and that **Connolly** has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe 
**Patterson**'s "authorship" of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an 
extension of the **Patterson** franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--
effectively other authors writing under the **Patterson** name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues.
