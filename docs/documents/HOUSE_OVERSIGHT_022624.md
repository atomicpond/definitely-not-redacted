Disgusting: Clinton Snared In Pedophile Ring 
Will having friends in high places exempt him from the rule of law? 
Kris Zane — March 27, **2014**  
According to former child sex slave Virginia Roberts and a class action lawsuit against convicted billionaire 
pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, former President Bill Clinton was present during sex parties involving up to twenty 
underage girls at Epstein's secluded island in the **Caribbean**. That flight records show Clinton was flown on 
numerous occasions to the island on Epstein's private jet. Clinton had a close relationship with an employee of 
Epstein's who compiled thousands of photos of nude young girls posed in lewd positions. And these photos 
were used as a catalog for Epstein to loan out his girls to powerful politicians and British royalty, including Bill 
Clinton. 
According to the lawsuit:  
Advertisement-content continues below 
...Clinton was friends with an unnamed woman who "kept images of naked underage children on her computer, 
helped to recruit underage children for Epstein... and photographed underage females in sexually explicit 
poses." 
While Epstein was indicted and jailed for his pedophilia, Bill Clinton oddly has remained unscathed, more than 
likely by having friends in high places. 
If Bill Clinton is in fact a pedophile, will the American people demand that he be put away for a very long **Time** 
so that he can't hurt any more children? Or will having friends in high places exempt him from the rule of law? 
**Time** will tell.

You do realize that Bill Clinton used to be the President, right? And that Hillary hasn't said that she's even 
going to run in '16 yet, right? Low information voter.

Andy really hit the nail on the head when he signed himself off as "low information voter", most of them don't 
want to admit it.

This is my shocked look. Here's hoping this, or something like it will keep that vile, hideous witch of a wife of 
his out of the campaign in 2016.

Like some of the people stated when he was caught "playing" with Monica......he's just a man. Media blew it 
off, the Demons yelled about going after him just because he was a Demon. I don't think THIS will be "told" to 
the people, especially by the media. Don't want to make this man's wife look bad. Then, remember how "slick" 
asked for the meaning of "is" and "sex." Demons can be some of the most vile and ugly people on the 
planet.......
