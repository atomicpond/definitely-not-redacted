﻿Wall Street Journal, **December** 30, **2016**
The Fable of Edward Snowden
As he seeks a pardon, the NSA thief has told multiple lies about what he stole and his
dealings with Russian **Intelligence**.
EDWARD JAY EPSTEIN
Of all the lies that Edward Snowden has told since his massive theft of secrets from the
**National Security Agency** and his journey to **Russia** via **Hong Kong** in 2013, none is
more provocative than the claim that he never intended to engage in espionage, and was
only a “whistleblower” seeking to expose the overreach of NSA’s information gathering.
With the clock ticking on Mr. Snowden’s chance of a pardon, now is a good time to
review what we have learned about his real mission.
Mr. Snowden’s theft of **America**’s most closely guarded communication secrets occurred
in **May 2013**, according to the criminal complaint filed against him by federal prosecutors
**the following month**. At the time Mr. Snowden was a 29-year-old technologist working
as an analyst-in-training for the consulting firm of Booz Allen Hamilton at the regional
base of **the **National Security Agency**** (NSA) in Oahu, **Hawaii**. On **May 20**, only some six
weeks after his job there began, he failed to show up for work, emailing his supervisor
that he was at the hospital being tested for epilepsy.
This excuse was untrue. Mr. Snowden was not even in **Hawaii**. He was in **Hong Kong**.
He had flown there with a cache of secret data that he had stolen from the NSA.
This was not the only lie Mr. Snowden told. As became clear during my investigation
over **the past three years**, nearly every element of the narrative Mr. Snowden has
provided, which reached its final iteration in Oliver Stone’s **2016** movie, “Snowden,” is
demonstrably false.
This narrative began soon after Mr. Snowden arrived in **Hong Kong**, where he arranged
to meet with Laura Poitras, a **Berlin**-based documentary filmmaker, and Glenn
Greenwald, a **Brazil**-based blogger for the **Guardian**. Both journalists were longtime
critics of NSA surveillance with whom Mr. Snowden (under the alias Citizen Four) had
been in contact for **four months**.
To provide them with scoops discrediting NSA operations, Mr. Snowden culled several
thousand documents out of his huge cache of stolen material, including two explosive
documents he asked them to use in their initial stories. One was the now-famous secret
order from **America**’s Foreign **Intelligence** Surveillance Act court requiring **Verizon** to
turn over to the NSA its billing records for its phone users in the U.S. The other was an
NSA slide presentation detailing its ability to intercept communications of non-American
users of the internet via a joint program with the FBI code-named Prism.
These documents were published in 2013 on June 5 and 6, followed by a video in which
he identified himself as the leaker and a whistleblower.
At the heart of Mr. Snowden’s narrative was his claim that while he may have
incidentally “touched” other data in his search of NSA files, he took only documents that
exposed the malfeasance of the NSA and gave all of them to journalists.
Yet even as Mr. Snowden’s narrative was taking hold in the public realm, a secret
damage assessment done by the NSA and **Pentagon** told a very different story. According
to a unanimous report declassified on Dec. 22 by the **HOUSE** Permanent Select Committee
on **Intelligence**, the investigation showed that Mr. Snowden had “removed” (not merely
touched) 1.5 million documents. That huge number was based on, among other evidence,
electronic logs that recorded the selection, copying and moving of documents.
The number of purloined documents is more than what NSA officials were willing to say
in 2013 about the removal of data, possibly because the **HOUSE** committee had the benefit
of the **Pentagon**’s more-extensive investigation. But even just taking into account the
material that Mr. Snowden handed over to journalists, the **December** **HOUSE** report
concluded that he compromised “secrets that protect American troops overseas and
secrets that provide vital defenses against terrorists and nation-states.” These were, the
report said, “merely the tip of the iceberg.”
The **Pentagon**’s investigation during 2013 and **2014** employed hundreds of militaryintelligence
officers, working around the clock, to review all 1.5 million documents. Most
had nothing to do with domestic surveillance or whistle blowing. They were mainly
military secrets, as Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of **the Joint Chiefs of Staff**, testified
before **the ****HOUSE** Armed Services** Committee** on March 6, **2014**.
It was not the quantity of Mr. Snowden’s theft but the quality that was most telling. Mr.
Snowden’s theft put documents at risk that could reveal the NSA’s Level 3 tool kit—a
reference to documents containing the NSA’s most-important sources and methods. Since
the agency was created in 1952, **Russia** and other adversary nations had been trying to
penetrate its Level-3 secrets without great success.
Yet it was precisely these secrets that Mr. Snowden changed jobs to steal. In an interview
in Hong Kon
