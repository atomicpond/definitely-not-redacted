this from a fraud web site, your mimister will get upset that you dont want to at least try, what do we have to 
lose , always the pitch. THe following from the fraud site. --The essential fact in all advance-fee fraud 
operations is that the promised money transfer never happens—because the money does not exist. The 
perpetrators rely on the fact that, by the time the victim realizes this (often only after being confronted by a 
third party who has noticed the transactions or conversation and recognized the scam), the victim may have 
sent thousands of dollars of their own money, and sometimes thousands or millions more that has been 
borrowed or stolen, to the scammer via an untraceable and/or irreversible means such as wire  
transfer. Stay away, however if you want to embarass your possible opponent , you might set it up so that 
he looks like a fool, ask for amemo of why he thinks you should agree, have it include as many detials as 
possible, so that when you prove its a fraud„ you will make him look very silly as opposed to his saying , you 
missed an opportunity, anyway„ glad you are well

**Jeffrey**, 
Need your advice. 
My finance minister is telling me that he has an anonymous funds manager who is willing to deposit 4 billion 
dollars in **Maldives** and that they are willing to lend a percentage of that in exchange for government 
promissory notes. The 4 billion would be deposited in **the **Central Bank****. But they want us to set up a special 
purpose vehicle, a construction company fully owned by the government to receive the loan. Such a company 
can only be set up under a presidential decree. 
I am also told that the funds manager would be charging **Maldives** upfront a certain percentage of the amount 
lent. 
I don't feel I have enough information on this. I don't know who is this funds manager. They always want the 
finance minister to meet them in **Bangkok** or some place outside. Why would anyone want to deposit such a 
large amount here when we don't have a credit rating and public debt is so high. I feel very uncomfortable 
about this. 
What do you think I should do. I am very uncomfortable. In addition to the finance minister, a leading 
politician and leader of the coalition parliamentary group is behind it. He could be my leading contender for 
presidency. 
Does this sound all ridiculous to you. I have a strange feeling about this whole thing. 
Best regards 
Waheed

Hi, 
Would be great if **Lisa** could visit us. She sounds like the right person to help us get organized. 
**Maldives** just got elected **Vice President** of International Renewable Energy Agency. We are also **Vice Chair** 
of **the UN **Human Rights Council****. Not too bad considering we had so much bad coverage **this year** 
internationally. 
Best regards,

Hi 
II ' 
The campaign team is starting to come together. We are continuing discussions with **Jim** and **tomorrow** 
we will meet him face to face on skype. We will brief him on the situation here so that he will be able to 
advice us more effectively. Already he has sent some very useful suggestions and we are working on 
them. 
Getting the right people to head various aspects on the campaign is difficult here but we should be able 
to pull the team together shortly.

We will need some more help from **Ian** and Rory because we are still weak on international 
communication. Some old negative stuff keeps coming up in the **Guardian** newspaper in **England**. But 
most of the international media is not paying much attention to **Maldives** right now. 
I have asked Rory to help find a full time communications guy to
