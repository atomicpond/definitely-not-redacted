Positive clinical data, increases in federal funding and the first regulatory approval of a manufactured stem 
cell product mean momentum is building in the US. With the re-election of **President Obama**, this is likely to

When US **President **Barack Obama**** came into office he made good on his promise to overturn President George W. Bush's executive 
order that - with the exception of a handful of existing stem cell lines - prohibited federal funding of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) 
research. 
Special Report - Stem Cell Research under Horizon 2020 
Stem Cell Research in Horizon 2020: Experts debate what **Europe** must do to maintain its lead in regenerative medicine  
The view from the US: Stem cell therapy steps up a gear with first approval and improved political climate  
View from **Europe**: Delivering on the vision of regenerative medicine and stem cells  
Talking to the experts: Why the EU should support human embryonic stem cell research in Horizon 2020  
OVERVIEW: Regenerate the future - human embryonic stem cell research is crucial to deliver health and growth  
This easing of restrictions on hESC research was expected to engender enough confidence to attract investors into the space and 
encourage pharmaceutical and biotech companies to build robust product pipelines based on stem cell therapies. However, a tougher 
regulatory climate for biopharmaceuticals in general and a protracted legal challenge to the relaxing of rules on hESCs has served to 
keep both big pharma companies and venture capitalists on the sidelines to date. 
Nevertheless, there has been progress, particularly at the research end of the development spectrum. Three and a half years on stem 
cells are no longer high on the political agenda as they once were. This speaks to the generally positive public acceptance of stem cell 
research in the US. A Research!America poll of likely voters in the presidential election, conducted in **August 2012**, found that 61 per 
cent of prospective voters were in favor of expanding funding for hESC research. 
Investor interest 
Looking back over his first term in office Obama can point to some major gains. These include funding increases for the National 
Institutes of Health's (**NIH**) stem cell initiatives, and greater investor interest in the wider field of regenerative medicine including the use 
of adult stem cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. 
However, it hasn't all been smooth sailing. Although after protracted forethought, the US Food and Drug Administration (**FDA**) gave the 
green light for the Californian biotech Geron to begin the very first human clinical trial of a human embryonic stem cell-derived therapy 
in **January **2009****, the trial has not been without its problems. 
The Phase I trial, treating patients with acute spinal cord injury, was hit with an **FDA** clinical hold causing significant delays to its 
initiation in **2010**. **a year later**, after 15 years' effort, the Geron washed its hands of the programme, blaming its withdrawal from the 
stem cell space on capital scarcity and uncertain economic conditions. The decision wiped out a leading player in hESC translation and 
commercialisation. However, the regenerative medicine sector has been able to recover and is beginning to blossom. (See Public 
Markets section below). The prime movers in the Geron trial are now attempting to revive it. 
Research funding robust 
Federal funding for all forms of stem cell research has increased over **the past four years**. However, the **NIH** funding component for 
hESC has been dogged by litigation for **the past three years**. In Sherley v. Sebelius, researchers James Sherley and Theresa Deisher, 
who worked with adult stem cells, claimed the **NIH** guidelines violated the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal 
funds for research in which human embryos are destroyed or discarded. This overhang was not finally removed until **August 2012** when 
a three-judge panel from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld the **NIH** **2009** guidelines that 
permit funding of hESC research. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 013482 
Through its Common Fund the **NIH** has established the Center for Regenerative Medicine (**NIH** CRM), to support this field, with the 
goal of accelerating the translation of stem cell-based clinical therapies. 
State funding filling the void 
With stem cell research in general not attracting a significant amount of venture funding, the ****California** Institute** of Regenerative 
Medicine (CIRM), which was established in **2004** with $3 billion for stem cell research at **California** universities and research inst
