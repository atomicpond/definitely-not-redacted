It won't take long to do. We're just swamped. I'll get something to you when I can. 
My biggest fear about taking this job is that there wouldn't be enough to do. You told me that concern was crazy. You 
were right.

On our to-do list, but back of the envelope, we satisfied ourselves that after depreciation, we would show a profit. (In 
part because **Apollo** charter payments factor in depreciation.)

Adding Internet and possibly changing cushions. I recommended we do it with the 4 year inspection in **the spring**, but

GV is in inspection and going well. Not sure what renovations you mean? 
On depreciation, we think we cannot use accelerated due to foreign travel preponderance, and obviously can't use
