R REPRINT OF THIS STORY 
**just days** before a **Friday** deadline, **the **Justice Department**** has reassigned the **Jeffrey **Epstein**** victims' rights case to 
the U.S. Attorney's **Office** in **Atlanta**, the attorneys representing **Epstein**'s victims' attorneys said **Tuesday**. 
Miami federal prosecutors, in letter to attorneys for the victims's lawyers on Monday, said they had recused 
themselves from the case, according to **Brad Edwards** and **Jack **Scarola****, representing **Epstein**'s victims. 
The reassignment means that the U.S. attorney for **the Northern District** of **Georgia**, **Byung J. "BJay**" Pak, will 
oversee the case for the government. Pak, a former **Georgia** lawmaker, was appointed **Atlanta**'s chief federal 
prosecutor by President Trump in **October 2017**. 
**the **Justice Department**** is still under a **Friday** deadline for prosecutors to confer with the victims' attorneys in an 
effort to settle the case. On **Feb. 22**, U.S. District Judge **Kenneth A. Marra** in **Palm Beach** ruled that federal 
prosecutors, under former Miami U.S. Attorney **Alexander **Acosta****, broke the law when they concealed a plea 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031399 
agreement from more than 30 underage girls in **Palm Beach** who had been sexually abused by **Epstein**, a 
multimillionaire **New York** hedge fund manager. 
Marra stopped short of voiding the agreement, which granted **Epstein** and an untold number of accomplices 
immunity from federal prosecution for sex trafficking crimes, provided **Epstein** plead guilty to minor charges in state 
court. At the time of the plea deal, federal prosecutors had gathered enough evidence against **Epstein** to write a 53-
page federal indictment, court records show.

The story behind a **Palm Beach** sex offender's remarkable deal 
**Emily Michot** 
An investigation by **the Miami **Herald****, "Perversion of Justice," found that after **Acosta** met privately with one of 
**Epstein**'s lawyers, the government agreed to seal the plea agreement so that no one — not the victims, not even the 
state court judge who sentenced **Epstein** — would know the full extent of his crimes. **Epstein**, now 66, was allowed 
to plead guilty to prostitution charges and served **13 months** in the ****Palm Beach** County** jail, where he was given 
liberal work release, and allowed to travel to **New York** and his private island in the **Caribbean** during his 
subsequent house arrest. He was released in 2009, and now divides his time between **New York**, **Palm Beach** and the 
U.S. Virgin Islands. 
The **Herald** interviewed four of **Epstein**'s victims, who were as young as 13 at the time they were abused by **Epstein**. 
They said they felt betrayed by state and federal prosecutors, who treated them like prostitutes instead of victims. 
Two of them sued the federal government in 2008 under the Crime Victims' Rights Act, which grants crime victims 
the right to be informed about plea deals and to confer with prosecutors. 
Marra, in a 33-page opinion, said prosecutors not only intentionally violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act, but they 
misled the girls into believing that the FBI's sex trafficking case against **Epstein** was ongoing — when, in fact, 
prosecutors had secretly closed it after sealing the plea bargain from the public record. 
Marra, noting that he reviewed affidavits, depositions and interrogatories, said "**Epstein** worked in concert with 
others to obtain minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of others." 
The victims' attorneys — Edwards, **Scarola** and **Paul Cassell** — have asked **the **Justice Department**** to throw out 
**Epstein**'s plea agreement and reopen the criminal investigation. 
Edwards, who brought the victims' rights case against the government, said transferring the case to another 
jurisdiction is a prudent decision.

"I think it's good that we're going to get fresh eyes and a fresh opinion on the way the case was handled," Edwards 
said **Tuesday**. "We were obviously in an adversarial posture with the U.S. Attorney's **Office** in Miami because they 
handled the case to begin with." 
Miami's new U.S. Attorney, **Ariana Fajardo Orshan** — who was appointed by President Trump in **September** — did 
not respond to a request for comment.
