                              **AIPAC** SPEECH **2013** – MINISTER OF **Defense** - EHUD BARAK
     •  Thank you for such a warm welcome. 
•  What an indescribable feeling to be surrounded by so many true friends in the capital of the world's greatest democracy.
•  Members of the **Administration**, Members of **Congress**, distinguished ambassadors, especially our ambassador Michael Oren…. Michael, Rosey, **Bob**, **David**, **Howard** and **Richard**, **AIPAC** members… older and young…
•  Good **evening** to you all.
•  It is your toil and your graft – your unwavering support – that keep us safe.
•   I have six humble words for all of you:  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
•  I would like to express my personal appreciation to **President Obama** and Secretary Panetta for their resolute backing of **Israel**.
•  History will surely record your immeasurable contribution to the strength of **Israel**, and the maintenance of the truly special relationship between our peoples. 
•   On behalf of the people of **Israel**, I wish Secretary **Hagel** all the best in his new role.  
•  As Secretary of **Defense** he will, no doubt, serve his country with the same pride and honor with which he served, both on the battlefield and in **Congress**. 
•  It is great to see so many young activists here. Thank you for your energetic commitment to **Israel**! 
•   A commitment which is so lucidly dictated by the head… yet so deeply underpinned by the heart…
•  Keep it up – you are the future! 

************************************

•  It is thanks to the rock solid US-**Israel** relationship, alongside the devotion of the young men and women of the **IDF**, that our capacity to defend ourselves, has been guaranteed for **years** to come!
•   With US support, combined with the ingenuity of our scientists; **Israel** finds itself at the cutting edge of missile **Defense** technology.
•  The ‘Iron Dome’ recently intercepted over 400 incoming terrorist rockets.  Practically – this is like hitting a bullet… with a bullet!
•  Just last week, we – the US and **Israel** – conducted a successful exo-atmospheric test of the Arrow 3 interceptor. 
•  **the State of **Israel**** simply would not be the strong island of stability it is, without one crucial constant. 
•  You! ****the United States** of America**. Its people. Its leadership.  Its **Congress**. Its Jewish community. 

***********************************

•  It is no secret, and I'll repeat it again, that we live in a tough neighborhood, where there is no mercy for the weak.  And no second chance for those who cannot defend themselves.
•  **Israel** is the strongest country in the region and the only genuinely open democracy.
•  An unprecedented geopolitical earthquake in **the last three **years**** has shattered the generations’ old regional order.
•   There are two clear lessons and one insight which I have drawn from this period:
•  # 1: Be modest with predictions……. especially about the future!  Take **Egypt** as an example; Mubarak was unable to predict it… who did?  Who thinks he could?

•  #2:  When friends tell me: Don’t worry…  If worse comes to worst … the world will step forward and act!
•   My answer is: Do not take this for granted.
•  Look at **Syria** – you don't need classified intelligence; it’s on your screens.  **Assad**’s jet fighters, tanks and artillery are slaughtering his own citizens.  Over 70,000 Syrians killed. 
•  Yet still… there is no sense of direction and no political will to act.
•  There is an extremely relevant lesson here… especially for all of us in **Israel**. 
•  And an insight…
•  Many believe that the root cause for all the problems in **the **Middle East****… is our inability to solve the conflict with the Palestinians. 
•  Well, I say… That’s not true!
•   Recent developments in **the **Middle East**** have been far beyond our control… and independent of our deeds.
•  Even if a peace agreement with the Palestinians had been signed and sealed a long time ago:
     o  **the Muslim Brotherhood** would still have come to power in **Egypt**
     o  **Syria** would still be mired in a bloody civil war
     o  **And **Iran**** would still be pursuing nuclear capabilities and a hegemonic role in the Gulf 

•  And ladies and gentlemen,
•   It is **Iran**'s pursuit of nuclear capabilities which is the greatest challenge facing **Israel**, the region and the world **today**… 
•  A nuclear **Iran** spells the end of any conceivable non-proliferation regime. 
•   ****Saudi Arabia****, **Turkey** and later **Egypt** will follow suit.   In the future, even terrorist groups **May** try.  
•  Diplomatic efforts continue.  Sanctions are unprecedented and hurting, but frankly – while exhausting all diplomatic means is understandable – I do not believe it will lead to a “moment of truth”, where the Ayatollahs will give up their nuclear aspirations.

•  Therefore, all options must remain on the table.

•  We have stated this time and again.

•  And we expect all those who say it… to mean it… 

•  Ladies and gentlemen… We mean it.

•  And let me repeat it: we… mean it.

**************************************

•  A nuclear **Iran** is the most imminent and acute danger
