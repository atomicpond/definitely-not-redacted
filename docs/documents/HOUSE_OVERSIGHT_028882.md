Subject: writing up proposal 
Importance: **High 
Dear **Jeffrey****, 
**larry** has told me that you and a friend would like to contribute to my project (hallelujah and thank you a 
million times, **Jeffrey**) and that I ought to write up a proposal asking for 500,000. This is wonderful. If this 
comes to pass, the best way for that money to come, I think, is as a gift to Poetry in **America**, an initiative at 
EdLabs at ******Harvard** University****. This will give me discretion over its disbursement to HarvardX and **WGBH**, but 
this will be absolutely be a **Harvard** gift that will count as Campaign success and from which **Harvard** will take 
some (but not as much)overhead. . So far the best finance people I've met are at EdLabs and they are happy to 
manage these funds for me. There are other ways to give me this money that leave **Harvard** out, but my 
understanding is that your friend would like this to be a **Harvard** gift. 
Here's a draft of what I'd like to do with that money. 
I'd like 500,000 to do post-production and distribution of a whole historical period of American poetry (1914-
1945 is what I'm thinking—Modernism) and including three episodes of tv. 
The raw materials for that period include interviews with Bill Clinton (including footage not yet used by 
**WGBH**), Peter Gallison, Walter Isaacson, **Lena Dunham**, Woody Allen (whose lawyers didn't like our release a 
while ago, but we're hoping will soften over time), Harrison Ford (still a maybe), Robert Polito, Sarah Kay, Al 
Filreis, **Rafael Campo**, Susan Howe, kids from Nantucket High School, kids from Brookline High 
School, **Alfre Woodard**, Jane Pickering, Jay Parini, **Ray Dalio**, Leon Wieseltier, **Richard Dawkins** and others; 
and footage shot in **Harlem**, **Greenwich Village**, midtown, **Chicago**, **London** (if I have the money to hire a crew 
there; don't now ), at museums including the Fogg, ****Harvard** Museum** of Natural History, Frost's **HOUSE** in Ripton 
Vermont and more. 
This allows the donor to give to a big **Harvard** Campaign priority, Teaching and Learning , by supporting Poetry 
in **America**, allowing me to produce the crucial segment of the online course with the highest (TV quality) 
production values and so also supplying higher quality video to **WGBH** as a way also to cut their costs. 
Currently, HarvardX skimps (on lighting, for instance--see the Bill Clinton interview) and while **WGBH** ladles 
money raised by others into everything. I have been pounding away at my friends at **WGBH** and I know that 
**WGBH** producer will work with HarvardX if they can give him footage of the right quality. . That is, we'll use 
HarvardX as the backlot for **WGBH** so as to squeeze three episodes out for 250. 
This proposal does not include experiments in schools or the curricular development into courses for teachers 
that you've seen in other (million dollar ) proposals. But the courses for teachers can't happen before the 
footage is developed, and these courses will have as their centerpiece the **WGBH** episodes, and so this funding 
will make all the rest possible. 
I can polish this narrative and or edit it, if there are things you think I have wrong. 
And I can attach a draft budget based on real **Harvard** numbers (what my **Harvard** video editor, producer, media 
manager cost) as well as a draft **WGBH** budget I'll now go an negotiate with them. Or we can do that at a 
second stage. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 028882 
Let me know what you think? And when are we reading **Whitman** together. Why don't we set a date for **Feb** 
when Poetry in **America** 3: **Whitman** is running online and we could screen a little video and then have a 
discussion around your table with you and some friends?
