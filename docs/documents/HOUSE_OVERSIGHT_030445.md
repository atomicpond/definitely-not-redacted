'I'm not sure I'd like me if I was listening to me.' — John Humphrys 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 030446 
John Humphrys is the Radio 4 **today** programme presenter, whose forensic and sometimes 
aggressive interviews with figures in authority inspire love and loathing in equal measure. The 
**Observer**'s television critic once wrote that if he ever found himself sitting next to Hum phrys at a 
dinner party he would probably drive a fork through his hand. The Tory politician Jonathan 
Aitken accused him of 'poisoning the well of democratic debate', a comment which prompted an 
outburst of support for Humphrys, with the **Daily Mail** describing him as one of the most brilliant 
journalists in the country'. 
This autumn, as Humphrys steps down after **32 years** at **today** and publishes a long-awaited 
memoir, he comes to the Intelligence Squared stage to give an exclusive, behind-the-scenes 
account of his extraordinary career. 
Turning the tables on Humphrys and pitching the questions will be his **today** colleague Justin 
Webb. Humphrys will recount the momentous episodes of his career, such as his interview with 
**BBC** correspondent Andrew Gilligan in **2003**. Gilligan claimed that the government had 
deliberately 'sexed up' the dossier on the threat posed by **Saddam Hussein** in order to justify 
the Iraq War. A chain of events ensued, including the suicide of the dossier's source, Dr David 
Kelly, severe damage to Tony Blair's reputation and the Hutton and Chiloot inquiries into the 
war. And then there was the time Humphrys helped to get his own boss fired. His tough 
interview with the **BBC** Director General George Entwistle, **days** after the **BBC** had made false 
child abuse allegations against Lord McAlpine, lead to Entwistle's resignation after a mere 53 
**days** in the job. 
Join us on October 9 and hear Humphrys' previously untold stories about politicians, celebrities 
and the **BBC**, and give his trenchant views on the role of the media in politics and the health of 
our political system.
