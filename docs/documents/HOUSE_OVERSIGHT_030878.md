Subject: **Steve Bannon** was supposed to be in Michael ****Moore****'s 'Fahrenheit 11/9' 
Importance: High

**Steve Bannon** almost appeared in Michael 
****Moore****'s 'Fahrenheit 11/9' 
**Steve Bannon** was invited to be in Michael ****Moore****'s latest documentary, "Fahrenheit 11/9," 
and while the former **White **HOUSE**** strategist declined to go on camera, he did meet with 
****Moore**** for two hours, the filmmaker revealed after the film's **NYC** premiere. 
After a **Lincoln Center** screening, ****Moore****, at a Tavern on the Green party, revealed Bannon 
was almost in the film. "We wanted **Steve Bannon** to answer that first question in the film: 
'How the f—k did this happen?' " the liberal gadfly told guests. 
"It took a long time. We finally got him to come over, no cameras ... He said he wanted to 
talk to me first. And we talked to him for two hours." 
Ultimately, Bannon decided not to go on camera, but the conversation had a seismic impact 
on the finished film anyway. 
"He said something very profound to us, and it changed us and it changed the course of the 
film," ****Moore**** said of Bannon. "I asked him, 'How did you pull this [**Trump**'s election] 
off?' And he said, 'It's a very easy answer. Our side, we go for the head wound. Your side, 
you have pillow fights.'" 
****Moore**** continued, "That so f—ked us up to hear him say that ... watching him smirk as he 
said it. As soon as he left, we decided to watch the film... and put the pillow fight filter." 
One example ****Moore**** gave of a change to his film post-Bannon was a line about news 
networks being run by men, from "most" to "all." 
"It's amazing how we talk as liberals. We always want to be nice and maybe be fair," ****Moore**** 
explained. 
The film also jabs at the media, highlighting major newsmen who have turned out to be 
predators, including Matt Lauer and **Charlie Rose**. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 030878 
A spy told us, "Everyone in the theater hissed when Les Moonves' face came up on-screen." 
****Moore**** also held a Q&A after the screening. 
The movie's already premiered in ****Moore****'s hometown of **Flint**, Mich., and played the 
Toronto International Film Festival.
