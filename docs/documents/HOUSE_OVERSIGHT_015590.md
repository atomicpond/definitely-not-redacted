﻿Filing # 37357304 E-Filed 02/03/2016 12:44:44 PM
**Bradley J. Edwards** and
**Paul G. Cassell**,
vs.
Plaintiffs/**Counterclaim Defendants**,
ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ,
Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff.
___________________________________________/
IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE
SEVENTEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT
IN AND FOR ****Broward County****, FLORIDA
CASE NO.: CACE 15-000072
DEFENDANT/COUNTERCLAIM PLAINTIFF ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ’S REDACTED
MOTION TO MODIFY CONFIDENTIALITY ORDER
Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff, Alan M. Dershowitz (“Dershowitz”), by and through
undersigned counsel, hereby files his Redacted Motion to Modify Confidentiality Order of
January 12, 2016, and in support thereof states the following:
On January 16, 2016, Defendant Alan M. Dershowitz began the deposition of non-party
Virginia Roberts Giuffre (“Roberts”). Pursuant to this Court’s January 12, 2016 Confidentiality
Order, that transcript currently is under seal. The Confidentiality Order should be modified at
least to allow Dershowitz to defend this case. Dershowitz and his counsel need to be able to
contact witnesses, inform them of Roberts’s testimony, and ask them whether Ms. Roberts’s
testimony is accurate. They also need to be able to use Ms. Roberts’s testimony in other ways as
part of the defense effort, such as by providing it to expert witnesses, among other things. The
bottom line is that Dershowitz’s counsel must be able to use Roberts’s testimony as necessary in
their professional judgment to represent their client, as a matter of fairness and due process.
Accordingly, Dershowitz requests that the Court modify the Confidentiality Order to
confirm that Dershowitz’s counsel may disclose Ms. Roberts’s testimony as they deem necessary
in their professional judgment in order to represent Dershowitz in this case.
BACKGROUND & EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Dershowitz was first presented with Roberts’s heinous and false allegations against him
when her lawyers, **Bradley J. Edwards** (“Edwards”) and **Paul G. Cassell** (“Cassell”), filed certain
now-stricken allegations in the action styled Jane Doe, et al. v. United States of America, No. 08-
80736 (S.D. Fla.) (the “Federal Action”). After Dershowitz defended himself to the media,
Edwards and Cassell sued Dershowitz for defamation. The falsity of Roberts’s allegations, her
credibility, and the investigation her lawyers took to assess those allegations and credibility
before filing those allegations are a critical part of Dershowitz’s defense.
On April 9, 2015, Roberts moved for an order “quashing the subpoena duces tecum
served on her by Defendant, or alternatively, pursuant to Florida Rules of **Civil Procedure**
1.280(c) for issuance of a protective order sharply limiting the scope of the subpoena” (the
“Motion to Quash”). See Motion to Quash, attached hereto as Exhibit A. Roberts did not move
to seal the deposition transcript and the resulting order did not seal it, but instead directed that “a
confidentiality order shall be entered.” See November 4, 2015 Email from Judicial Assistant
Susan Moss, attached hereto as Exhibit B and November 12, 2015 Order, attached hereto as
Exhibit C. The Confidentiality Order then prepared by Roberts’s counsel and consented to by all
parties includes a provision stating that “[t]he deposition testimony of Non-Party Virginia
Giuffre will be designated as ‘Confidential’ and not subject to public disclosure” and that “[i]t
may only be filed under seal.” See January 12, 2016 Confidentiality Order, attached hereto as
Exhibit D.
2
Dershowitz now requests that the Court modify the Confidentiality Order to allow
Dershowitz to use the transcript for those limited purposes as deemed necessary in the
professional judgment of his counsel to ensure Dershowitz is afforded his right to build and
present his defense.
I. DERSHOWITZ MUST BE ALLOWED TO CONTACT WITNESSES AND
ADVISE THEM OF WHAT ROBERTS ALLEGES IN ORDER TO VERIFY OR
DISPROVE HER ALLEGATIONS AND CREDIBILITY AND DETERMINE
WHETHER PLAINTIFFS EVER MADE EFFORT TO CONTACT THESE
INDIVIDUALS TO VERIFY ROBERTS’S ALLEGATIONS AND CREDIBILITY.
As explained by Plaintiffs Edwards and Cassell in their Response to Dershowitz’s Motion
to Determine Confidentiality, the “sexual abuse allegations filed by Edwards and Cassell for
their client Ms. Virginia Giuffre are not peripheral to this lawsuit – they are inherent to it.”
Plaintiffs’ Response to Dershowitz’s Motion to Determine Confidentiality, November 23, 2015,
attached hereto as Exhibit E at 4 (emphasis added). Those “sexual abuse allegations filed by
Edwards and Cassell for their client” go beyond Dershowitz. Another inherent part of this
lawsuit is what investigation, if any, Plaintiffs undertook with respect to the scope of Roberts’s
allegations, all of which bear upon her credibility. Dershowitz argues that Plaintiffs did not
perform a reasonable investigation before making the allegations in the Federal Action.
Plaintiffs argue that they did. Dershowitz must be allowed to contact witnesses and advise them
of what Robe
