Subject: and....another bit of advice ...? on WA 
Importance: **High 
Dear **Jeffrey****, 
As you probably know, Woody Allen's legal team said that we couldn't use the film we shot of him: online, for 
broadcast, anywhere. 
It was a fantastic experience taping with him and so, even if I can't ever use the footage, I'm still grateful to you 
for making the day possible. But of course I'd like to use the footage. I decided when--way back-- we got this 
very negative answer back from his lawyers that I should just take my time about asking --since it would take 
us **2 years** to be ready to edit the footage anyway (The online course is chronological. When I taped Woody we 
were still back in **1730**. Now we've gotten to **the 1920s**) 
Well, we've now arrived at **the season** when we'll be editing materials on William Carlos Williams for our 
course on Modernism and, as we discussed on **Saturday**, on poetry and other arts, The Poetry of Art, Sport, 
and Play 
I would also, of course, love to make a tv episode out of the conversation, but the threshold question is whether 
he'll let us use it for anything at all. In case it would matter, 
Other performers who have already taped with me include 
**John Lithgow**, 
****Diane Paulus** 
Julie** Taymor 
Nas 
Eve **Ensler 
Damian Woetzel** 
Kate Burton 
Lil **Buck Riley 
Alfre** **Woodard 
**Herbie Hancock**** 
**Tony Kushner** 
Natalia Zukerman 
and those who have agreed to tape with me include 
Sally Field 
**Lena **Dunham 
Yo Yo** Ma** 
**Anna Deveare Smith** 
and more. 
Those in other fields include journalists, senators, president **CLINTON** etc etc. You've read my pitch before (many 
times) 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 028955 
His is one of only two releases that we haven't gotten. What do you think of my chances? 
****Lisa 
Elisa** New**

Harvard** University**
