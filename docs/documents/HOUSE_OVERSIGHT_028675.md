In State of the Union  
address, Obama lays out 
his second-term agenda  
Editorial 
February 13, 2013 -- TWO DOMESTIC 
concerns towered above all others as 
**President Obama** addressed a joint session 
of Congress on Tuesday night on the state  
of the union. One was stubbornly slow 
economic growth. The other was the long-
term threat to prosperity posed by the 
structural mismatch between the federal 
government's projected revenue and its 
spending commitments. A successful 
second term for Mr. Obama will require 
both credible proposals for overcoming 
those related challenges and the 
determination to carry them through. 
The president addressed the deficit and 
debt first, and at some length. This was 
fitting, giving that the most pressing piece 
of business facing Washington is what to 
do about the impending $85 billion across-
the-board spending cut. He was forthright

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028675 
in declaring that this so-called sequester 
threatens the military as well as domestic 
programs. But his plan to avoid it basically 
repeated the offer of a "balanced approach" 
— unspecified tax hikes and spending cuts 
— which Republicans have already 
rejected. 
Somewhat more substantively, he called for 
a larger deficit-reduction deal built around 
loophole-closing tax reform and what he 
called "modest" reforms to Medicare and 
entitlements. In an apparent effort to rally 
Democrats to this cause, he called on 
"those of us who care deeply about 
programs like Medicare" to "embrace" 
reform. 
Yet in promising the same amount of 
Medicare savings as the Simpson-Bowles 
commision proposed, Mr. Obama did not 
mention that this would be a mere $341 
billion over 10 years. All told, he envisions 
shaving an additional $1.5 trillion off 
projected deficits over 10 years, which 
would leave the national debt at a 
historically aberrant 70-odd percent of 
gross domestic product. In short, he 
declined to push back against the mind-set 
within his party that considers acceptable 
"stabilizing" the debt at this level by the 
time Mr. Obama's second term ends. At 
best, that would buy a respite of a few 
years before the debt resumed its upward 
climb.

As for raising the economy's growth 
potential, the president was more 
persuasive. His emphasis on reforming the 
tangled and counterproductive corporate 
tax code was especially welcome, and 
relatively likely to draw GOP support. He 
offered several promising ideas on 
education, including a promise of "high-
quality preschool" for all children, though 
how that would square with his promise not 
to increase the deficit by a single dime 
went unexplained. He sounded a ringing 
call for greater federal attention to college 
cost containment. "Taxpayers can't keep on 
subsidizing" spiraling tuition, he said, 
candidly and correctly. 
As European trading partners had hoped, 
the president endorsed negotiations for a 
transatlantic free-trade zone, which would 
help America's export industries and the 
jobs that depend on them. Coupled with an 
agreement that Obama is promoting for the 
Pacific region, the proposal has the 
potential to make his second term fruitful 
for global trade. He also suggested raising 
the federal minimum wage, from $7.25 per 
hour to $9 — although the precise amount 
is less important, in our view, than the 
president's call for annual cost-of-living 
adjustments. 
In keeping with Mr. Obama's theme of 
nation-building at home, foreign policy 
played a secondary role in his speech. He 
promised to bring home half of the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028677 
remaining U.S. troops in Afghanistan 
within the next year. But officials said the 
withdrawal would be weighted toward 
year's end, leaving most of the troops to 
partner with Afghan troops for much of this 
year. The president said the Uni
