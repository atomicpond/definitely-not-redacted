Clinton did not cut ties to **Maxwell** and she was a guest at **Chelsea** Clinton's wedding in
**2010**
Rarely-pictured Jeffrey Epstein has kept a low profile and eschewed public events

allegations of sexual offences with underage girls

This is the society fixer alleged to have helped find underage girls for pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein
- helping Bill Clinton celebrate his daughter's marriage.
****Ghislaine** **Maxwell**** was photographed at the former First Daughter's glittering **July **2010**** wedding to Marc
Mezvinsky - despite Epstein having been convicted of soliciting underage girls.
Clinton had cut ties to Epstein after his arrest over allegations of sex with girls as young as 14.
But this photograph shows that he maintained close ties to **Maxwell**, who is accused in court papers of
procuring underage girls for Epstein, her former boyfriend, as she smiles as President Clinton walks a
beaming **Chelsea** down the aisle.
SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO
Friends in high places: ****Ghislaine** **Maxwell**** is a good friend of President Bill Clinton and can
be seen on the right at his daughter **Chelsea**'s wedding in **July **2010****
**Maxwell**, now 50, attended the wedding in Rhinebeck, NY, on **July 31, **2010****, with the cream of
Washington D.C.
Described as feeling like a 'family wedding', guests included former Secretary of **State** Madeleine
Albright, Terry McAuliffe, Governor of **Virginia**, and leading figure in the civil rights movement Vernon
Jordan.
For **Maxwell** to remain a Clinton chum is an interesting turn of events.
Just two years earlier, her former lover and friend Jeffrey Epstein was sentenced to **18 months** behind bars
after pleading to a single **State** charge of soliciting prostitution. He served **13 months** in prison.
President Clinton had been so close to both to Epstein he had joined him on his private jet and stayed on
his private **Caribbean** island.
Speaking to the Mail On Sunday in 2011, **Virginia** Roberts - who claims in court papers she was kept as
Epstein's 'sex slave' and forced to sleep with Prince Andrew three times - said she met President Clinton
twice, but was never 'lent out'.
Buckingham Palace vehemently denies the claims, as does **Maxwell**. Her legal team stresses she was not
involved in, or connected to the criminal proceedings against Epstein and with regards to **Virginia**
Roberts' claims, they stressed she denies each and every allegation.
**Virginia**, now a married mother of three, claimed that President Clinton traveled with Epstein to a number
of destinations, including three times on the billionaire’s private jet, and enjoyed intimate dinners with
both him and **Maxwell**.
On one occasion, she said that Epstein flew the former President, **Hollywood** actor and staunch Democrat
Kevin Spacey and another actor friend of Mr Clinton’s, **Chris Tucker**, to **Africa**, to ‘discuss AIDS policy’.
Epstein, who has donated more than £75,000 over **the years** to candidates from **the Democratic party**,
also flew with President Clinton in November 2003 to destinations including **Russia**, **Oslo**, **Hong Kong**,
**Shanghai** and **Beijing**.
On one occasion, she alleged, Epstein did invite two young brunettes to a dinner which he gave on his
island for President Clinton shortly after he left office. But, as far as she knows, the ex-President did not
take the bait.
**Maxwell** declines to comment on Prince Andrew allegations
Mysterious: ****Ghislaine** **Maxwell**** beams as her ex-lover, disgraced billionaire Jeffrey Epstein
hugs her as they attend a **Manhattan** bash on **March 15, **2005**** - the same day **Palm Beach**
police launched an investigation into his abuse of underage girls
‘I’d have been about 17 at the time,’ she said: ‘I flew to the **Caribbean** with Jeffrey and then **Ghislaine**
**Maxwell** went to pick up Bill in a huge black helicopter that Jeffrey had bought her.
‘She’d always wanted to fly and Jeffrey paid for her to take lessons, and I remember she was very excited
because she got her licence around **the first year** we met.
'I used to get frightened flying with her but Bill had **the **Secret Service**** with him and I remember him
talking about what a good job she did.
‘I only ever met Bill twice but Jeffrey had told me that they were good friends.
'I asked, “How come?” and he laughed and said, “He owes me some favours.” Maybe he was just joking but
it constantly surprised
