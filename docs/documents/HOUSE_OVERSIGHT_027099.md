**Israel** Policy Forum 
On **Iran**: How to Repair the Widening American-Israeli Rift 
Ephraim Sneh 
The Islamist takeover in **the **Middle East**** and ****North Africa**** has created perilous strategic 
turbulence in the region. Consequently, it is now critically important that **the United States** and 
its few allies cooperate closely. Unfortunately, this has not been the case in **recent weeks** for US-
**Israel** relations regarding **Iran**'s nuclear program. The disagreement about attacking **Iran**'s 
nuclear facilities has turned into ugly bickering, much of it disguised. This is harmful for both 
**Israel** and **the United States**. 
To heal this rift — which is necessary to effectively address the Iranian threat — we must 
understand the following basic facts: 
1. The Israeli fear of a nuclear **Iran** is genuine. It is not a political trick of Prime Minister 
**Benjamin **Netanyahu**** or **Defense** Minister **Ehud Barak**. A nuclear **Iran** would bolster and 
encourage extremist militant forces across the region. The moderates would be discouraged, 
intimidated and invariably weakened to the point where they would be unable to negotiate with 
**Israel**. In just a few years, **Israel** will be surrounded by three **Pakistan**-like' countries: Saudi 
Arabia, **Egypt** and **Turkey**. All three would possess nuclear weapons and be dominated 
politically by Islamists. In such a scenario, **Israel** would lose its strategic advantage in the region. 
It would lose its lead as a country of entrepreneurship and excellence, as foreign investment 
would decline and talented young Israelis would build their future abroad. No responsible Israeli 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 027099 
leader will allow such a nightmare to become a reality. The hateful declarations of **Iran**'s leaders, 
committed to wiping the Jewish state off the map, do not assuage Israelis' fears. 
2. Economic sanctions cannot convince the regime in Teheran to abandon its nuclear project. 
However, sanctions can bring about the collapse of the regime if they are vigorously 
implemented and enforced. 
3. An American military strike against **Iran**'s nuclear facilities would be more effective 
than **An Israeli** one. But disparaging **Israel**'s capabilities and its military ingenuity, undermining 
its deterrence effect, is a grave mistake. 
4. **Israel**'s operational window is closing. If **Israel** has to cope alone with the Iranian threat, its 
window of operational opportunity is narrower than the American one. It has to act sooner. 
5. **An Israeli** military strike in **the next two months**, contravening repeated demands by the 
U.S. President to postpone it, would be counterproductive. The damage of defying the 
President would be greater than the damage sustained by allowing the Iranian regime an 
additional few months of advancing toward acquiring the bomb. Such a strike may broaden the 
gap between the U.S. and **Israel** and weaken the alliance, which all previous Israeli Prime-
Ministers have safeguarded as a strategic asset of **Israel**. 
6. **the United States** has failed to prevent countries like **Pakistan** or **North Korea** from 
obtaining nuclear weapons. This record feeds Israeli skepticism about a U.S. success in the 
case of **Iran**. This skepticism prevails despite the clear rhetoric and unquestionable commitments 
of the President and the Secretaries of State and **Defense** to prevent a nuclear **Iran**. 
7. The fact that the **Israeli Prime Minister** and the Republican presidential candidate share 
the same political benefactor feeds suspicions in the Obama administration about **Netanyahu**'s 
motives for attacking **Iran** **a few weeks** before the U.S. presidential elections. 
8. The regional perspective cannot continue ignoring the unresolved Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict. This issue can no longer be swept under the rug. Maintaining the status quo is politically 
comfortable in the short-run, but it will be combustible and devastating in the long run. 
Achieving the two-state solution will preserve **Israel** as a Jewish, democratic state. It will end 
**Israel**'s regional isolation. It will rebuild **America**'s standing and influence in the Arab and 
Muslim world. Furthermore, these last two outcomes will strengthen **America**'s and **Israel**'s 
hands in thwarting **Iran**'s nuclear weapons ambitions. 
These eight basic facts combine to produce a complex reality. When fully understood, they can 
pave the way to restoring U.S.-Israeli harmony. There is no symmetry between **the United States**, 
the super-power, and its tiny ally, **Israel**. But the "package" required from each side in order to 
men
