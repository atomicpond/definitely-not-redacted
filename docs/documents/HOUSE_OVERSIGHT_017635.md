I. Introduction
Federal courts should treat **Crime Victims** fairly in the criminal process. In a nod to that goal, the Advisory Committee on the
**Federal Rules** of Criminal Procedure (Advisory Committee) has circulated for public comment proposed amendments to the
**Federal Rules** of Criminal Procedure (the Rules) regarding **Crime Victims**' rights. These amendments attempt to implement the
recently-enacted **Crime Victims**' Rights Act (CVRA), 1 which guarantees **Crime Victims** a series of rights, including the right to
be treated fairly. Unfortunately, the proposed amendments are mere tentative, half measures that do not begin to fully protect
**Crime Victims**.
This Article contends that the Advisory Committee should broaden its vision of the proper role for **Crime Victims** and
recommend far more expansive victim protections. In the CVRA, Congress articulated specific rights for **Crime Victims**, such as
the right to be notified of court hearings, to attend those hearings, and to speak at appropriate points in the process. 2 But along
with these specific rights came the sweeping requirement that **Crime Victims** "be treated with fairness and with respect for the
victim's dignity and privacy." 3 This congressional command must not be ignored. In addition, entirely apart from any
congressional dictate, **Crime Victims** deserve fair treatment in the federal system. Acting for the federal judiciary, the Advisory
Committee should make certain that the Rules fully reflect victims' interests rather than allow the initiative for protecting
victims to pass to other branches of government.
This Article proceeds in five parts. Following this Introduction, Part II reviews events leading to the recently circulated
amendments. The amendments were prompted by the CVRA - an act passed by Congress in 2004 to protect victims' rights
through the federal criminal process. To comply with the CVRA, the federal criminal rules had to be amended in many places,

Pub. L. No. 108-405, § 102(a), 118 Stat. 2260, 2261-62 (codified as amended at **18 U.S.C. § 3771** (Supp. 2006)).

Id. § 3771(a)(8).

as I argued at length in an earlier article. 4 After receiving my suggested changes, the Advisory Committee agreed with some,
but declined to adopt many of the others. At issue for the Advisory Committee was whether to proceed narrowly by changing
only a few rules to track specific congressional directives or to proceed more broadly by reworking the entire body of federal
criminal rules to ensure that they are all fair to **Crime Victims**. The Committee opted for the narrower approach.
Part III of this Article disputes the Advisory Committee's limited vision. Congress has required that the courts must treat crime
victims "with fairness" throughout the process. 5 The only way to fully implement that command is a [*864] thorough
reworking of the federal criminal rules to integrate victims into the day-to-day workings of the process. The Committee's
parsimonious amendments simply ignore that congressional directive and mean that, in practice, many of the federal criminal
rules will continue to overlook the legitimate interests of **Crime Victims**.
Part IV of this Article contains a rule-by-rule analysis of changes that should be made to the **Federal Rules**. The following
changes are of particular importance:
1. Ensuring that **Crime Victims**' attorneys can appear in court (Rule 1);
2. Providing for victim participation in the plea bargain process (Rule 11);
3. Protecting victims' addresses and telephone numbers from improper disclosure (Rule 12);
4. Guaranteeing victims the right to attend criminal depositions (Rule 15);
5. Protecting victims from having personal and confidential information improperly subp
