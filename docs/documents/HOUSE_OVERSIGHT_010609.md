Trump’s effect on MXN
We provide an empirical analysis of Donald Trump’s effects on the Mexican peso. Our
analysis suggests the exchange rate is perhaps as much as 15% undervalued. In our
view, buying the Mexican peso likely would prove a profitable strategy if Hillary Clinton
wins. However, we remain neutral for now given US election risks are likely to remain
high in the near term.
A model of MXN weekly returns including Trump
We estimate a model of MXN returns with standard financial fundamentals that also
includes Donald Trump’s RealClearPolitics polling average in the US presidential
election. It is generally accepted now that Trump’s chances in the US election have been
a major driver of the Mexican peso (Chart 1).

We estimate a regression of weekly returns on the MXN spot exchange rate on five
variables: a basket of commodity currencies, US equities, the 10-year US bond yield, the
two-year interest rate differential between MXN and USD swaps, and RealClearPolitics
polling average for Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election. The estimated
equation is
R MXN = b0 + b1*R basket + b2*R SP500 + b3*dy 10 + b4*(r MXN – r USD ) + b5*RCP + e
where R MXN is the MXN spot return, R basket is the commodity currency basket spot return,
R SP500 is the SP500 index return, dy 10 is the 10-year US bond yield change, r MXN – r USD is
the two-year swap rate differential (lagged one period), RCP is RealClearPolitics polling
average for Donald Trump, and e is an error term. The commodity currency basket
consists of BRL, CLP, COP, CAD, NOK and AUD with equal weights. The full data sample
has weekly frequency and runs from 6/20/2012 to 9/21/2016.
The model without Trump yields an R-squared coefficient of 0.50. Including Trump’s
variable increases the coefficient to 0.63, a significant improvement (Chart 2). We use
data only up to 1/27/2016 for parameter estimation of the financial variables. We use
the full sample to estimate the parameter on Trump’s variable due to its shorter history.

A possible 15% negative shock on MXN
According to the model that does not include Trump’s polling average, we estimate that
MXN should be trading at around 16.50, more than 15% stronger than current levels
