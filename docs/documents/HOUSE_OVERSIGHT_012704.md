Jeffrey Epstein's attorneys fight to keep plea discussions private 
John Pacenti 
**2011**-04-2112:00:00 AM 
**Miami** attorney **Roy Black** and two other high-profile attorneys who represented billionaire sex offender 
Jeffrey Epstein have asked a federal judge to prohibit two alleged victims from obtaining correspondence 
between the defense team and federal prosecutors who hammered out a nonprosecution agreement. 
The two women identified in court papers only as ****Jane Doe** 1** and ****Jane Doe** 2** say the agreement should be 
invalidated because they were not adequately informed of the plan not to file federal charges against Epstein. 
The defense attorneys' motion to intervene states the sanctity of plea talks would be undermined if U.S. 
**District Judge Kenneth** Marra in **West **Palm Beach**** allows the correspondence to be used in the third-party 
civil action brought by the alleged victims. 
**New York** litigator **Jay Lefkowitz** and **Boston** criminal defense attorney Martin G. Weinberg joined Black in 
the motion filed April 7. 
The fight over the records comes amid claims that the defense strong-armed prosecutors into a cushy deal for 
Epstein. 
"The release of these letters and the precedent it would establish would have a severe chilling effect on the 
lawyers' ability to engage in candid settlement discussions with the government in future cases," the 13-page 
motion reads. "Indeed, to the extent such written correspondence is deemed discoverable by third parties, 
criminal defense attorneys and the government's lawyers alike would lose the ability to negotiate such 
agreements." 
The alleged victims maintain evidence shows Epstein molested more than 30 girls from **2001** to **2007**, luring 
them to his **Palm Beach** mansion on the pretext of giving him a massage. 
As part of the nonprosecution agreement, he pleaded guilty to a state charge of soliciting sex with a minor and

served **13 months** of an **18-month** sentence. He resurfaced recently in **New York** and has become the subject 
of news reports about socializing with **Britain**'s Prince Andrew. 
Personal Inquiry 
The women say the nonprosecution agreement should be scuttled and Epstein should be open to federal 
charges because they were not adequately consulted as required under the Crimes Victims Rights Act. They 
seek disclosure of all correspondence between Epstein's attorneys and the government, claiming it would show 
prosecutors failed to meet their obligation to keep them and other victims informed. 
The U.S. attorney's **Office** argued in a 54-page response April 8 to the women's lawsuit that the law does not 
apply because no federal charges were filed against the financier, only a state charge. 
The women were denied access to the letters in their civil lawsuit against Epstein, which was settled. The 
motion by Black, Lefkowitz and Weinberg said there is "no doubt" the women aim to disseminate the material 
to news outlets. They urge Marra to "decline the invitation to fuel the media campaign against Mr. Epstein." 
Epstein has had plenty of trouble avoiding the media of late. Reports about his friendship with Prince Andrew 
sparked a **March 20** three-page letter from **Alex Acosta**, U.S. attorney when the agreement was reached, to the 
****Daily Beast**** online news site. 
Acosta said the federal government intervened in Epstein's case at request of police because the **Palm Beach** 
state attorney's **Office** was going to offer him a deal with no jail time. Acosta said his **Office** secured, through 
the nonprosecution agreement, jail time for Epstein, his plea to a sex crime against a minor and his designation 
as a sex offender. 
Acosta's letter said Epstein's defense team was not happy with these conditions and tried to hire private 
investigators to delve into the personal lives of prosecutors assigned to the case as a way of undermining the 
**Office**'s insistence on conditions that went beyond the state case. 
"Defense counsel investigated individual prosecutors and their families, looking for personal peccadilloes that 
may provide a basis for disqualification," Acosta wrote. 
Sources say the efforts targeted Assistant U.S. Attorneys **Jeffrey Sloman** and Ann Marie Villafalia. Acosta 
refused to remove them. 
Acosta, now the law dean at Florida International University in **Miami**, said he had no comments beyond his 
letter. The U.S. attorney's **Office** also declined to comment. 
Sloman, who took over as acting U.S. attorney when Acosta became FIU's law dean, later joined the Ferraro 
Law
