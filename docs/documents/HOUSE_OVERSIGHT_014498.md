V.I. businesses face higher unemployment taxes
as territory struggles to pay down $69 million debt
By BRIAN O’CONNOR
**Daily News Staff**
Territory business owners will pay
four times the normal federal unemployment
tax rate this year because
of an unpaid government debt, documents
show.
The federal unemployment insurance
tax rate is traditionally 6 percent
on the first $7,000 an employee
makes. However, the federal government
usually offers a credit of 5.4
percent, meaning most employers actually
pay about 0.6 percent, according
to the IRS.
States — and territories — with
unemployment insurance programs
meeting federal standards are required
to meet their unemployment
obligations. When a state can’t meet
its unemployment obligations, it’s
entitled to take loans from the Federal
Unemployment Insurance Trust
Fund.
Federal documents show only one
state and one jurisdiction — California
and **the **U.S. **Virgin Islands****** — are
currently in that position.
The territory owes $69,138,266.61
in loans, according to the **U.S. Department**
of Treasury website.
In fiscal year 2017, which began
Oct. 1, the loans have accrued
$294,349.15 in interest payments
alone.
The V.I. Labor Department is in
charge of administering unemployment
insurance. Labor Commissioner
Catherine Hendry did not return a
number of phone calls seeking comment.
Government House spokeswoman
Cherie Munchez would not comment,
saying that Hendry would issue
a prepared statement about the debt
by Wednesday.
Provisions of the Federal Unemployment
Tax Act stipulate that in
states or territories with outstanding
balances in the fund, businesses are
subject to a credit reduction, which is
collected and directed toward the unpaid
balance, according to Robert Pavosevich,
Supervisor of the Actuarial
Team in the Office of Unemployment
Insurance’s Division of Fiscal and
Actuarial Services in the Department
of Labor.
**Virgin Islands** business owners
will pay the original 0.6 percent, plus
an additional 1.8 percent caused by
the unpaid balance, for a total of 2.4
percent, Pavosevich said.
At the fully discounted rate, an
employer would pay $42 for each
employee earning $7,000. At the Virgin
Islands rate, employers will have
to pay $168.
After two years with an unpaid
balance, the discount decreases by
0.3 percent each year until the total
discount disappears, Pavosevich said.
“It’s capped at 6 percent,” Pavosevich
said.
At the full 6 percent, employers
will have to pay $420 for each new
employee earning $7,000 that comes
on board. By law, that money can’t
come out of the wages themselves
and is paid out of the profits or losses
that employers face, said Charles
Engeman, an attorney who served on
the Unemployment Insurance Advisory
Council under the administration
of Gov. John deJongh Jr.
Without payment on the loan — or
waivers or relief, which has happened
three times since 2013 — the rate is
scheduled to max out by 2028. That’s
barring the imposition of step increases,
which can happen if the state
has an outstanding balance for a certain
number of years, or if — as was
the case in the tax year 2012 — step
increases are piled on by other provisions
of the law, which could move
the unemployment tax rate up faster.
“It looks like they’re not making
much headway,” Pavosevich said, referring
to the territory’s debt.
The territory wasn’t alone in 2011,
**the first year** the rate went up. In all,
20 states and **the **Virgin Islands**** received
a 0.3 percent credit reduction
that year, federal documents show.
That’s in part because of the lingering
effects of the Great Recession,
said Bennett Chan, a lawyer who
represents several businesses and has
worked with the St. Thomas-St. John
**Chamber of Commerce** in the past.
In general terms, states collected
more money than they paid out during
the years leading up to the 2008
market collapse, creating large surpluses.
Sometimes those surpluses
were subject to financial raids. Other
times — as was the case in the territory
— the surpluses were used as
a cause to reduce the amounts collected
