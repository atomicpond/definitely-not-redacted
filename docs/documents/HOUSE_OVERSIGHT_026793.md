Re: **Jeffrey **Epstein**** 
Dear Mr. Indyke: 
As you are aware, our firm represents TowersInvestors.com, Inc and **Mr. Steven 
Hoffenberg**. 
Mr Hoffenberg, through his long term contacts, as set forth below, believes he can assist 
Mr. **Epstein** in resolving his existing disputes with the Federal government without any jail time 
and to arrange for the sale of his financial business interests. 
Governor Ben Barnes is prepared to meet with **President Trump** with respect to obtaining 
an agreement with the Federal government. 
**Gary Baise**, a **Washington**, D.0 based attorney who has worked as senior attorney in the 
Department of Justice, is working with us and will meet with **the Department of Justice** to obtain 
an advantageous agreement in exchange for Mr. **Epstein**'s cooperation. 
Lastly, Don Engel, who Mr. **Epstein** knows, who worked with **Michael Milken** at Drexel 
Burnhan, will work with ****Goldman Sachs**** to take over Mr. **Epstein**'s business NOW. 
We strongly believe that Mr. **Epstein** will benefit substantially from the foregoing and will 
want to engage in mutually beneficial discussions. 
I am attaching a draft of a Complaint which Mr. Baise will file through local counsel if we 
cannot reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
Please contact me at your earliest convenience. 
Very truly yours,
