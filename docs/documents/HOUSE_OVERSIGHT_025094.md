RPE No. 30793  
**Cuba** in its new stage: SWOT Analysis 
Fundacion Internacional para la Libertad ("International Foundation for Freedom") 
New York, 8 November 2015 
On August 14th, 2015, the **United States** flag was raised in Havana, formally reestablishing diplomatic 
Relations between the **United States** and **Cuba**, which had been interrupted since January 3, 1961, 
some 54 years ago, when Ike Eisenhower was in power in Washington and Fidel Castro in Havana. 
The President of the **United States**, Barack Oba ma, and his Secretary of **State**, **John Kerry**, among many 
other personalities, have requested the lifting of the economic embargo imposed on **Cuba** by John F. 
Kennedy in **1962**, in the midst of the **Cold War**, and in **recent days** through Havana have come Germans, 
French, Dutch, and Spaniards to propose bridges to the ****Island****. 
The perception is that **Cuba**, the largest of the thirteen markets in the **Caribbean** and with the largest 
population, followed very closely by the Dominican Republic, again opens itself up to international trade 
and relations. 
Overview of the Spanish Antilles 
**Cuba**: 110,860 Km2 — 11,031,000 inhabitants — GDP per capita (PPP) US$10,200. 
Dominican Republic - 46,670 km2 — 10,349,741 inhabitants — GDP per capita (PPP) US$12,800 
**Puerto Rico**: 13,790 km2 — 3,620,897 inhabitants — GDP per capital (PPP) US$16,300 
For purposes of brevity and objectivity, given the composition of this audience, I'm going to employ the 
structure of the so-called SWOT analysis for contributing to the business decision of investing in that 
market, refraining from doing so, or awaiting greater clarity and better times. It will not be my function 
to recommend what should be done, but rather to place certain data and basic elements on the table for 
decision-makers. They will know what is best for them to do. 
The SWOT analysis, as we know, lists the positive Strengths, the present Opportunities, the Weaknesses 
perceived, and the Threats detected. 
Strengths 
1. The thawing announced simultaneously by Presidents **Barack Obama** and Ratll Castro 
last December 17th, to which are added the various steps taken by both governments in 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025094 
the direction of reconciliation, have created an atmosphere of triumphalism regarding 
the economic future of **Cuba** loaded with good expectations. 
2. According to the surveys, support for Obama's measures is notably of the majority in 
both the **United States** and **Cuba**, but there are reasons to believe that a substantial 
percentage of Cuban exiles also support it. 
3. As part of this approach, it's expected that some or many foreign companies will explore 
the possibility of investing in the ****Island****. There is significant human capital available in 
**Cuba**: over eight hundred thousand university students and a generally healthy and 
educated populace. 
4. The Cuban government, after 56 years of continuous exercise of power, appears solidly 
in control of the situation, without any person or group whatsoever that visibly 
challenges its authority with any possibility of success. 
5. After Hugo Chavez's election to the presidency of **Venezuela** at the end of 1998, that oil-
producing country transferred to **Cuba** enormous amounts of resources. The economist 
Carmelo Mesa-Lago calculates the **annual** amount of aid at its highest point as thirteen 
billion dollars. 
6. A quarter century after the disappearance of the Communist block, the Castro 
government, together with **North Korea**, has shown itself to be the exception to the rule: 
It has maintained control without renouncing the principles of Marxism-Leninism and 
the single party system, although cautiously attempting to modify its productive 
apparatus. 
7. In that spirit of "reforms-within-the-system," in **April 2010** Raul Castro presented what 
are known as Guidelines, outlining his reform of the **State**, creating spaces for foreign 
investment and "freelancers." 
8. The most important or most visible institutions in Cuban society, such as the Armed 
Forces and the Assembly of the People's Power, appear to fully support the steps taken 
by the president, General Rail Castro, in the direction of a re-encounter with the United 
States. 
9. Some foreign offices of **the European Union**, such as the Spaniards, the Germans, and 
the Dutch, look favorably on what is happening, as does the Vatican, which has 
participated in the secret meetings to bring an end to the conflicts between **Cuba** and 
the **United States**. **Pope Francis** has announced his upcoming visit to **Cuba** as a kind of 
support for the changes. 
10. **Cuba** exercises enormous influence in the countries of the ALBA, and the clear 
leadership of the group known as the nations of the XXIth Century Socialism: **Venezuela**, 
**Bolivia**, **Ecuador**, and Nicaragua. 
11. To this list we must add the sympathy and solidarity that **Cuba** inspires in governments 
such as those of **Argentina**, **Brazil**, **Uruguay**
