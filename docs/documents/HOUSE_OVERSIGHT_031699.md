VERY INTERESTING. G 
, Fred Simon 
The problems we face **today** are there because the people who 
work for a living are outnumbered by those who vote for a  
We Are Not Coming Back 
Please take a moment to digest this provocative article by a 
Jewish Rabbi from Teaneck, N.J. 
It is far and away the most succinct and thoughtful  
explanation of how our nation is changing. The article 
appeared in The **Israel** National News, and is directed to 
Jewish readership. 70% of American Jews vote as Democrats. 
The Rabbi has some interesting comments in that regard. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 031699 
Rabbi Steven Pruzansky is the spiritual leader of 
Congregation Bnai Yeshurun in Teaneck, **New Jersey** 
"The most charitable way of explaining the election results of **2012** is that Americans voted 
for the status quo - for the incumbent President and for a divided **Congress**. They must enjoy 
gridlock, partisanship, incompetence, economic stagnation and avoidance of responsibility. 
And fewer people voted. 
But as we awake from the nightmare, it is important to eschew the facile explanations for the 
**Romney** defeat that will prevail among the chattering classes. **Romney** did not lose because 
of the effects of Hurricane Sandy that devastated this area, nor did he lose because he ran a 
poor campaign, nor did he lose because the Republicans could have chosen better 
candidates, nor did he lose because Obama benefited from a slight uptick in the economy 
due to the business cycle. 
**Romney** lost because he didn't get enough votes to win. 
That might seem obvious, but not for the obvious reasons. **Romney** lost because the 
conservative virtues - the traditional American virtues — of liberty, hard work, free enterprise, 
private initiative and aspirations to moral greatness - no longer inspire or animate a majority 
of the electorate. 
The simplest reason why **Romney** lost was because it is impossible to compete against free 
stuff. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 031700 
Every businessman knows this; that is why the "loss leader" or the giveaway is such a 
powerful marketing tool. Obama's **America** is one in which free stuff is given away: the adults 
among the 47,000,000 on food stamps clearly recognized for whom they should vote, and so 
they did, by the tens of millions; those who - courtesy of Obama - receive two full **years** of 
unemployment benefits (which, of course, both disincentivizes looking for work and also 
motivates people to work off the books while collecting their windfall) surely know for whom 
to vote. The lure of free stuff is irresistible. 
The defining moment of the whole campaign was the revelation of the secretly-recorded video 
in which **Romney** acknowledged the difficulty of winning an election in which "47% of the 
people" start off against him because they pay no taxes and just receive money - "free stuff" - 
from the government. 
Almost half of the population has no skin in the game - they 
don't care about high taxes, promoting business, or creating 
jobs, nor do they care that the money for their free stuff is 
being borrowed from their children and from the Chinese. 
They just want the free stuff that comes their way at someone 
else's expense. In the end, that 47% leaves very little margin 
for error for any Republican, and does not bode well for the 
future. 
It is impossible to imagine a conservative candidate winning against such overwhelming 
odds. People do vote their pocketbooks. In essence, the people vote for a **Congress** who will 
not raise their taxes, and for a President who will give them free stuff, never mind who has to 
pay for it. 
That engenders the second reason why **Romney** lost: the inescapable conclusion that the 
electorate is ignorant and uninformed. Indeed, it does not pay to be an informed voter, 
because most other voters - the clear majority — are unintelligent and easily swayed by 
emotion and raw populism. That is the indelicate way of saying that too many people vote 
with their hearts and not their heads. That is why Obama did not have to produce a second 
term agenda, or even defend his first-term record. He needed only to portray **Mitt **Romney**** as 
a rapacious capitalist who throws elderly women over a cliff, when he is not just snatching 
away their cancer medication, while starving the poor and cutting taxes for the rich.
