30 Ordinary Photos With Amazing Backstories  
Posted: 07 Mar **2019** 05:15 AM PST 
Sometimes certain pictures have unique significant meanings to us even though others would see them as a simple 
snapshot. That old faded picture of you sitting on the beach? Maybe it was the first time you ever saw the sea. A 2o-year-
old picture with a childhood friend at their birthday party? Maybe it's the last picture of you together before you drifted 
apart. Bored **Panda** has compiled a list of photos that look ordinary at first glance but become something special once you 
hear the stories behind them. Check them out in the gallery below!

#1 Tadeusz Zytkiewicz Holding A Picture Of Himself 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020666 
This is Tadeusz Zytkiewicz — the first person in **Poland** to receive a heart transplant — holding a picture of himself and the 
performing doctor, Zbigniew Religa, with his colleague, seen sleeping in the corner. The difficult surgery took 23 hours 
and Dr. Religa stayed up to monitor the patient's vitals. The photo, taken by American photographer James Stanfield, 
was chosen to by **National Geographic** to be the best picture of 1987. 
#2 The Three Unsung Heroes Of Chernobyl 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020667 
The three men — Alexei Ananenko (second left) and soldiers Valeri Bezpalov (center) and Boris Baranov (far right) — 
risked their lives o drain the fluid near the reactor during the Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster in Pripyat, **Ukraine** in 1986. 
After the plant's water-cooling system failed and a pool formed under the reactor to days into the disaster, there was a 
high risk that the lava-like radioactive substance could melt through the barriers and drop the reactor's core into said 
pool, causing a steam explosion. Luckily, the men were able to drain the fluid and spectacularly, all three survived. 
#3 Cher Arni 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020668 
Cher Ami was the name given to a pigeon that saved 200 soldiers during WWI. The poor bird was shot multiple times 
and lost an eye and a leg but still managed to deliver a message from the trapped battalion. 
#4 'Behind Closed Doors' 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020669 
Photographer Donna Ferrato took this gruesome picture back in 1982 when photographing the lives of wealthy swingers. 
The couple — Elisabeth and Bengt — were having an argument and it quickly escalated, resulting in Bengt hitting his 
partner. The photographer wanted the photo to be published but many publishers refused and she only managed to do so 
in **1991**. The book was titled 'Living With the Enemy' and chronicled events of domestic violence. Thanks to Donna's 
efforts, **Congress** passed the Violence Against Women Act in **1994**. 
#5 Behind The Counter 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020670 
The photo, taken by Fred Blackwell on May 28, 1963, shows three protesters — John Salter, Joan Trumpauer and Anne 
Moody — sitting at the counter of a white-only Woolworth's five-and-dime store in Jackson while an angry mob pours 
ketchup, sugar, and mustard on them. The three protesters were from the Tougaloo College, a black college that went on 
to become the core of the civil rights movement in **Mississippi**. 
#6 'Wait For Me, Daddy' 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020671 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020672 
This moving photo was captured by Claude Detloff in **Vancouver** during WWII as soldiers of the Duke of Connaught's 
Own Rifles were marching off to fight. The boy's father safely returned home in October 1945. 
#7 Childhood Friends 
On April 6, 1972, workers of French company Joint Francais went on strike and were confronted by the riot police. This 
picture, captured by Jacques Gourmelen, shows two men — Guy Burmieux, a worker at the company, and Jean-Yvon 
Antignac, a riot policeman — standing face to face. In that moment, the two recognized eachother — they were childhood 
friends. "I saw him [Guy Burmieux] go toward his friend and grab him by the collar. He wept with rage and told him, 'Go 
ahead and hit me while you're at it!' The other one didn't move a muscle," recalled the photographer. 
#8 'Burst Of Joy' 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020673 
This photo, taken in 1973 and titled 'Burst of Joy', shows **United States** Air Force Lt Col Robert L. Stirm reuniting with his 
family afte
