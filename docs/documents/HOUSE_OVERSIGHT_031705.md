I'll make this quick. I have one question and one observation about Mitt **Romney**'s visit to **Israel**. The question 
is this: Since the whole trip was not about learning anything but about how to satisfy the political whims of the 
right-wing, super pro-Bibi Netanyahu, American Jewish casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, why didn't they just 
do the whole thing in **Las **Vegas****? I mean, it was all about money anyway — how much **Romney** would abase 
himself by saying whatever the Israeli right wanted to hear and how big a jackpot of donations Adelson would 
shower on the **Romney** campaign in return. Really, **Vegas** would have been so much more appropriate than 
**Jerusalem**. They could have constructed a plastic Wailing Wall and saved so much on gas.

The observation is this: Much of what is wrong with the U.S.-**Israel** relationship **today** can be found in that 
**Romney** trip. In **recent years**, **the Republican Party** has decided to make **Israel** a wedge issue. In order to garner 
more Jewish (and evangelical) votes and money, the G.O.P. decided to "out-pro-**Israel**" the Democrats by being 
even more unquestioning of **Israel**. This arms race has pulled **the Democratic party** to the right on the Middle 
East and has basically forced the Obama team to shut down the peace process and drop any demands that **Israel** 
freeze settlements. This, in turn, has created a culture in **Washington** where **State Department** officials, not to 
mention politicians, are reluctant to even state publicly what is U.S. policy — that settlements are "an obstacle 
to peace" — for fear of being denounced as **anti-**Israel****. 
Add on top of that, the increasing role of money in U.S. politics and the importance of single donors who can 
write megachecks to "super PACs" — and the fact that the main **Israel** lobby, Aipac, has made itself the feared 
arbiter of which lawmakers are "pro" and which are "**anti-**Israel****" and, therefore, who should get donations and 
who should not — and you have a situation in which there are almost no brakes, no red lights, around **Israel** 
coming from **America** anymore. No wonder settlers now boast on op-ed pages that the game is over, they've 
won, **the West Bank** will remain with **Israel** forever — and they don't care what absorbing all of its Palestinians 
will mean for **Israel**'s future as a Jewish democracy. 
It is into this environment that **Romney** wandered to add more pandering and to declare how he will be so much 
nicer to **Israel** than big, bad Obama. This is a canard. On what matters to **Israel**'s survival — advanced

weaponry and intelligence — **Defense** Minister **Ehud Barak** told **CNN** on **Monday**, "I should tell you honestly 
that this administration under President Obama is doing in regard to our security more than anything that I can 
remember in the past." 
While **Romney** had time for a $50,000-a-plate breakfast with American Jewish donors in **Jerusalem**, with 
Adelson at his elbow, he did not have two hours to go to **Ramallah**, the seat of **the Palestinian Authority**, to meet 
with its president, **Mahmoud Abbas**, or to share publicly any ideas on how he would advance the peace process. 
He did have time, though, to point out to his Jewish hosts that Israelis are clearly more culturally entrepreneurial 
than Palestinians. **Israel** **today** is an amazing beehive of innovation — thanks, in part, to an influx of Russian 
brainpower, massive U.S. aid and smart policies. It's something Jews should be proud of But had **Romney** gone 
to **Ramallah** he would have seen a Palestinian beehive of entrepreneurship, too, albeit small, but not bad for a 
people living under occupation. Palestinian business talent also built **the Persian Gulf** states. In short, **Romney** 
didn't know what he was talking about. 
On peace, the Palestinians' diplomacy has been a fractured mess, and I still don't know if they can be a partner 
for a secure two-state deal with even the most liberal Israeli government. But I do know th
