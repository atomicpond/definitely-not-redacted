Rich, following up on your question from a while back about this topic. Please find a white paper attached. 
Regards, 
Amanda 
The election of Donald **Trump** as President is expected to lead to significant tax law changes. The tax changes may come 
in two parts: from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (**Obamacare**) and its related taxes and from comprehensive tax 
reform. Since Republicans will also have majorities in both the **HOUSE** and **Senate**, such changes could be undertaken 
without bipartisan support. Although it is not yet known exactly what the changes will be or when they would be 
effective, we are issuing this Tax Alert to inform you of changes that are anticipated, based on proposals made during 
the campaign by both President-elect **Trump** and the **HOUSE** Republicans. We also discuss how these changes may 
impact your planning, both currently and in the future.
