Former Obama lawyer nixes attorney general offer 
**Former ****White **HOUSE******** counsel turns down chance to succeed **Eric Holder** as attorney 
general 
By NEDRA PICKLER 
****Associated Press**** 
**Washington** (AP) — **Former ****White **HOUSE******** counsel **Kathryn Ruemmler** has told **President **Barack Obama**** 
she doesn't want to be nominated for attorney general, after he asked her to consider succeeding **Eric Holder**, 
people familiar with the discussions told **the ****Associated Press****** on **Friday**. 
Ruemmler was concerned that her experience as a close adviser to the president would have led to a difficult 
confirmation process in the current highly charged partisan environment, the sources said, speaking on a 
condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private discussions. They say Ruemmler, a 
top official at **the Justice Department** before moving to ****the ****White **HOUSE**********, was also concerned that could ignite 
political attacks against Obama. 
Ruemmler's withdrawal, in a phone call to the president **Wednesday**, leaves no obvious front-runner to replace 
Holder, who announced **a month ago** that he would step down once a replacement was confirmed. Ruemmler 
brought the law enforcement bonafides of a former prosecutor in the **Bush** administration who won convictions 
against **Enron**'s executives and the national security expertise of a top ****White **HOUSE****** official. 
Other candidates that administration officials have said have been considered include Solicitor General Don 
Verrilli; **Labor** Secretary Tom Perez; Loretta Lynch, U.S. attorney for **the **Eastern District**** of **New York**; Preet 
Bharara, U.S. attorney for **the **Southern District**** of **New York**; Jenny Durkan, who resigned as U.S. attorney in 
**Washington** state **last month**; former **Homeland Security** Secretary Janet Napolitano; Tony West, who recently 
resigned as the No. 3 official at **the Justice Department** and has taken a job at Pepsico; and Deputy Homeland 
Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. 
Ruemmler, now a partner at **Latham & Watkins** specializing in government investigations, had the closest 
relationship of the attorney general candidates to the president after serving as his legal gatekeeper at the White 
**HOUSE**. But that relationship also would have brought tough scrutiny, with Republicans likely to question her 
handling of controversies involving the **IRS**, **Benghazi** and the investigation of a ****White **HOUSE****** volunteer in a 
prostitution scandal.

Obama's aides say he has not yet made up his mind on whom to nominate and won't announce a choice until 
after the Nov. 4 elections, in part to avoid making the nominee into a political issue facing embattled 
Democratic candidates. They say he also hasn't decided whether to seek confirmation in the **Senate**'s lame duck 
session **later this year** or to wait until **the new year**, when Republicans are expected to pick up seats if not win 
outright control. 
****White **HOUSE****** chief of staff Denis McDonough said in a statement, "**Kathy** is someone who always tells it like it 
is, is a world class lawyer and remains a trusted adviser to the president. Anyone who knows **Kathy** knows she 
has impeccable judgment, extraordinary foresight and is a formidable force. But she is also as selfless as they 
come, and the president is proud to call her a close friend."
