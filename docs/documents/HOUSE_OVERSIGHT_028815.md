Executive Summary 
Opportunity 
Problem 
The power of word of mouth is becoming more critical to businesses as has never been 
witnessed before. Negative aspects associated with a brand can leave a long-term 
impact on its reputation. If a customer is facing a problem with your product or service, 
the world is going to hear about it. On the contrary, social media has the ultimate ability 
to turn audiences into customers and communicate positive messages. 
A marketer's worst nightmare is a social media campaign gone wrong. In such a 
situation, resources are diverted to fix the problem, disrupting the entire workflow. 
During a social media crisis, marketers are left with limited control over the market as 
the news spreads like wildfire. Businesses need to choose the right strategy and the 
most appropriate way to respond. 
With an increase in social media, marketing has become a two-way conversation 
between brand and consumer. Customers demand businesses to be proactive and 
efficient to meet their demands and **InsightsPod** provides businesses with the data to do 
just that and more.
