Eye on the Market, **February** 27, **2012** [the attached PDF is much easier to read **this **week****, particularly if you are interested in the energy science implications of **last **week**’s** press release from the **HOUSE** Minority Leader]

Topics: oil markets and **Iran**

 

Most of **this **week****’s note deals with oil prices and **Iran**, but I did want to point out a trend that is illustrative of how things are going globally.  One of the strongest aspects of the US recovery has been the rebound in business spending on equipment and software.  As highlighted by our friends at Hamiltonian Associates, sales by Caterpillar’s dealer network are a proxy for global trends.  Caterpillar’s US sales are leading the pack for the first time in a while, **Asia** is moderating, and **Europe** trails with a distinctly negative trend.  We expect a recovery in US payrolls **this year**, and eventually, in labor incomes.  The US recovery may be weak by historical standards, but expectations are pretty low (2.2% growth in **2012**).  We expect the US to exceed expectations, and for **Europe** ex-Germany to disappoint them.  Absent a blow-up in **Iran**, this view seems like it’s on track.  

 

“Iranium enrichment”: another hurdle for global markets to surmount

The near-term fundamentals don’t point to higher oil prices.  Oil demand has been revised down a bit, particularly in the OECD, and non-OPEC supply growth is a little higher in **2012** than in **recent years**.  After netting all the supply and demand factors, it looks like there will be a global oil inventory build in **2012** (see chart below), not something we would normally associate with rising oil prices.  However, even before we get to **Iran**, there are other factors contributing to higher prices: a pick-up in global growth expectations for **2013** and beyond; the explosion of **Central Bank** balance sheets and associated reflation goals (see **last **week**’s** EoTM); and the possibility that **China**’s will build strategic crude oil reserves to the IEA standard of **90 days** from their current level of 14.  Note as well that the inventory build is a small one, nowhere near 2002-**2007** levels.



 

 

That’s why **Iran** is a risk: a disruption would make oil markets even tighter, and drive gasoline prices up further.  Even before the **February** spike, gasoline prices relative to earnings and income were starting to bite (2nd chart).   The private sector can handle some gasoline price increases, but probably not much more than what we’ve seen already.  The spread between retail and wholesale gasoline prices is low ($0.35, compared to a $0.35-$1.00 range), suggesting further retail increases may be in store.

 

People like me now spend a lot of time on conference calls with geopolitical experts of different stripes.  On one call, speakers raised the probability of military action from 30% to 50%.  On another call, speakers mentioned that the US has “run out of senior military advisors to send to **Israel**, all requesting that **Israel** not attack unilaterally”, and believe **Israel** won’t.  A paper by Matt Kroenig in **Foreign Affairs** magazine entitled “Time to Attack **Iran**; Why a Strike is the Least Bad Option” resulted in a firestorm of criticism from multiple sides.  With sanctions appearing to work (**Iran**’s inflation, currency collapse, fewer buyers of its oil and a potential ban on Iranian banks from the global SWIFT payments network), won’t the US want to wait and see?  Most of the US military establishment seems to take this view.  The conjecture is endless.  Here are a few points I found to be of greatest relevance as we sift through this:

 

** The US and **Europe** appear to take the Israeli attack threat seriously.  Economic recoveries are just beginning to form in both regions, and there are elections coming up, so for politicians to ratchet up sanctions and drive up oil and gasoline prices, they must be very concerned that without tougher sanctions, the Israelis might act.

 

** **Iran**’s Fordow facility is key to understanding the debate about the effectiveness of military action, and why some are nervous that the “window for action is closing”.  Fordow is estimated to be 80-90 meters below grade, and is suspected of being ready for uranium enrichment.  The Iranians reportedly have ~80 kg of 20% enriched uranium (UF6), and need 25 kg more to convert it into enough uranium metal (UF4) for a nuclear bomb.  The most powerful conventional weapon in the US arsenal is the Massive Ordnance Penetration device (MOP), a 30,000 pound bomb with 5,000 pounds of explosives.  It travels at twice the speed of sound, and is designed to penetrate rock and concrete before detonating.  However, it would probably take 4 of these weapons, dropped in succession by B-2 bombers in the same exact spot, to destroy Fordow [a].
