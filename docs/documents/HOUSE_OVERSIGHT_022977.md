Sex slavery lawsuit links **Trump**'s 
Mar-a-Lago to pedophile ring: report

DON'T MISS STORIES. FOLLOW RAW STORY! 
Last fall's allegations of sexual assault against President Donald **Trump** failed to stop his 
presidency, but one of the more explosive of those allegations is once again making headlines. 
POLITICO reported that a new lawsuit reveals details linking **Trump** to billionaire 
pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender. The reports indicate that one lawsuit 
contains information about Virginia Giuffre who alleges that she met Epstein while working as 
a towel girl at Mar-a-Lago when she was 15 before being recruited into "sexual slavery". 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 022980 
Giuffre's case is set to appear before a judge on **May 15**, and although her accusations against 
Epstein have been public for some time, this is the first time the detail about her employment 
at Mar-a-Lago has been included. 
**last summer**, the **Trump**-Epstein connection made headlines when **Trump** was slated to win 
the Republican nomination, and just before the election, a woman came forward alleging that 
**Trump** raped her when she was 13 at one of Epstein's parties — only to drop suit a few days 
later. 
In **2015**, **Trump** lawyers denied claims of the then-candidate's involvement with Epstein by 
saying their only relation was that Epstein was "one of thousands of people who has visited 
Mar-a-Lago". Those claims that fly in the face of a **2002** **New York Magazine** interview in 
which **Trump** claimed to have known Epstein for **15 years**. 
"He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and 
many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life," 
**Trump** told reporters.
