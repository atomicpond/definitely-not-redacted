White Collar Titan Reid Weingarten on
Juries, Clients and the Scariest Federal
Prosecutors
Jenna Greene, The Litigation Daily
September 4, **2015**
Hope you never have to call Reid Weingarten. Because if you do, it means you’re in a world
of trouble.
The **Steptoe & Johnson LLP** partner is one of the country’s preeminent white collar defense
lawyers. His clients have included former **Worldcom** CEO Bernard Ebbers, former **Enron**
chief accounting officer Richard Causey, former Tyco general counsel Mark Belnick and film
director **Roman Polanski**, as well as ******Goldman** Sachs**** CEO Lloyd Blankfein.
But if you do have to call him, here’s a bonus: he’s one of the most
interesting, engaging lawyers you’ll ever meet.
Weingarten spoke at length with the Litigation Daily about his
practice—what it means when he wants the “smart jurors,” what he
says to prosecutors in their offices to convince them not to bring a case,
how he and close friend **Eric Holder** Jr. **years ago** started a foundation
that has helped thousands of juvenile offenders and at-risk teens.
The interview has been edited for clarity and length.
Lit Daily: A corporate executive recently told me he thought the best
lawyers are as much psychologists as legal experts. Do you agree?
Reid Weingarten: Yes, yes, yes. The ratio is probably two-thirds lawyer, one-third shrink.
There are two distinct parts to my practice—the New York piece, largely CEOs and CFOs,
Wall Street guys, hedge fund guys—and the D.C. piece, largely but not exclusively public
official types and people who deal with public officials.
These are all big-ego, extraordinarily successful people who find themselves dramatically at
odds with Uncle Sam, because typically people don’t come to me unless the Justice
Department wants to put them in prison for a long time and take all their money.

Sometimes their reaction is denial, sometimes shock and horror, sometimes anger, but it’s
always dramatic. The mission at a minimum is to get the client to understand what’s
happening so that he can be effective for me, in terms of my defending him.
LD: Have you ever declined to represent someone because you were so appalled by what
they did?
RW: At this point, I’m in the fortunate position of turning down more cases than I take. I turn
down cases for many reasons, though it’s not so much that I’m appalled by the behavior.
The way I look at it is, do I bring value? Is there something about me representing the
individual that adds something, as opposed to every other lawyer in town? I think if I halted,
or I was so shocked or appalled or dismayed by the conduct that I’d pull my punches, I’d
know that.
I break bread with the would-be client. If there’s a visceral feel, either overtly or covertly, that
I’m not going to want to spend time with him or her, it all factors in. There are often a variety
of factors that cause me to take seriously the potential of the representation, and then I turn
it down.
LD: Are conflicts much of an issue?
RW: Steptoe & Johnson is a big firm, but it’s not one of the megafirms. There have probably
been a dozen significant matters I got conflicted out of because of Steptoe’s other
representations. But I have colleagues who work at much bigger firms who are constantly
getting conflicted out of representations.
I represented the CEO of ******Goldman** Sachs****, and **Goldman** intersects with everyone in the
world. If I had nothing but **Goldman**-like representations, that would be an issue. But if you
represent Jesse Jackson Jr. or [other] public officials, as I do, the potential for conflicts is
significantly less.
LD: What agency is most likely to strike fear in the heart of defendants?
RW: **the Southern District** of New York is the elite prosecutor’s office in the country. I don’t
think you’d get much dispute there. They’re aggressive, they’re smart, they have this
enormous home court advantage. Right after them, there are several very fine, very
aggressive, very talented U.S. attorneys offices like **Chicago**, **Boston**, EDVA and certainly
**the District of Columbia**. And you can go to Topeka, **Kansas**, or Burlington, **Vermont**, and
find a federal prosecutor who is very smart, has a good case and is talented in court.
In **the Justice Department** itself, there’s **the Criminal Division**, and the two litigating
sections—the public integrity section, where I was for **10 years**, and the fraud section.
They’ve had their ups and downs. As a defense attorney dealing with both sections
regularly, you can have your hands full with either.
LD: Some of the people you’ve repres
