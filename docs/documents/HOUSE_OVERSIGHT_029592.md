**HARVARD UNIVERSITY 
DEPARTMENT** OF ENGLISH 
**Barker Center** - 12 ****Quincy Street** - Cambridge**, **Massachusetts** 02138 
**Elisa New** 
Powell M. **Cabot Professor** of **American Literature 
November** 25, 2018 
Dear **Ms. Williams**: 
Tel: 
Fax: 
I am writing now to invite you to be a featured guest on my public television 
series, Poetry in **America** (poetryinamerica.org). Poetry in **America**'s first 
**season**'s guests included Bill Clinton, **Joe Biden**, **Cynthia Nixon**, **Shaquille 
O'Neal**, **Yo Yo Ma**, **Samantha Power**, **Herbie Hancock**, **John McCain**, **Nas**, 
**Angela Duckworth**, **Bono**, Regina Spektor, **Frank Gehry**, **Stuart Weitzman**, E.O. 
Wilson and many others. In Seasons Two and Three we will have just as 
distinguished a line up. The series airs on public television stations 
everywhere, streams via ****Amazon** Prime** and other streaming services, and it is 
now also airing on a variety of domestic and international airlines. 
The poem I'd like to read and interpret with you is by **Pulitzer Prize** winner, 
Sharon Olds, and it's called "The Language of the Brag." It's a gutsy poem that 
compares feats of (male) athletic prowess-- and feats of poetic prowess-- to 
childbirth. You are the ideal reader for this poem: indeed, I picked it for the 
**season** in hopes you would be my co-interpreter. If you agree to film with me, 
I'll use what we capture in an upcoming **season** of Poetry in **America**. I'll also 
use the content in an online course for medical professionals I am creating in 
partnership with ****Harvard Medical School****. 
I thank you for considering this request. I would be very honored to work 
with you. 
Sincerely, 
**Elisa New**
