Highlight
This Article addresses whether crime victims should have rights during criminal investigations, using the Crime Victims'
Rights Act (CVRA) as the focal point for our discussion. This is a critical issue, as many criminal cases may never proceed to
formal charging. If crime victims have no rights during criminal investigations, then many crime victims will never have any
rights at all.
The issue of whether crime victims have rights in the criminal justice process recently came to a head when the Justice
Department released a memorandum contending that the CVRA does not extend crime victims any rights until prosecutors
choose to file formal criminal charges. This led the CVRA's Senate cosponsor, then-Senator Jon Kyl, to fire off an angry letter
to **the **Justice Department**** attacking its position. In our Article, we side with the Act's cosponsor. We believe that, properly
understood, the CVRA does extend crime victims' rights during criminal investigations.
Our Article proceeds in four parts. First, it highlights the importance of applying the Act before the formal filing of charges by
illustrating how dozens of victims in a notorious federal sex abuse case were deprived of the ability to participate meaningfully
in the criminal process when federal prosecutors narrowly interpreted their responsibilities under the Act. Second, the Article
reviews the purpose, text, structure, and history of the CVRA, concluding that they all support the conclusion that crime victims
have rights during criminal investigations. Third, our Article critiques the Department's memorandum, demonstrating that the
Department's analysis is unpersuasive. Fourth and finally, the Article provides a specific approach for determining when rights
should attach - specifically when federal law enforcement agencies have identified a crime with sufficient precision to send a
"target" letter to a criminal defendant. We also observe that federal and state prosecutors have already accorded rights to
victims before formally filing charges, which further undermines the Department's overly narrow construction of the Act.

Introduction
In recent years, federal and state enactments have given crime victims extensive rights to participate in criminal cases. Many of
these rights apply only after the filing of criminal charges, such as the victim's right to be heard during court proceedings. A
crime victim's right to deliver an impact statement at sentencing, for instance, can only be exercised after a prosecutor has filed
charges against a defendant and obtained a conviction. Other rights, however, can apply even before the formal filing of
charges. As one example, **the Crime Victims' Rights Act** (CVRA) 1 extends to federal crime victims the right to "confer" with
prosecutors. But can victims exercise this right before charges have been filed?
This question has tremendous practical importance. In many cases, prosecutors negotiate pleas well before any charges are ever
drafted. If crime victims' rights enactments do not extend rights to victims until the formal filing of charges, then crime victims
can be effectively excluded from the plea bargaining process. Yet the exclusion of victims in early stages of a criminal case
affects more than just the content of a plea deal. Crime victims will also lose other important rights in the process if the formal
filing of charges is the necessary trigger for those rights. If, for example, prosecutors work out a nonprosecution agreement
with an offender, they need not notify his victims of what they are doing or of the fact that potential charges will never be filed.
