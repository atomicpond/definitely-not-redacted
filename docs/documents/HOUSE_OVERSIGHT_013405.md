orneys Say Miami Prosecutors Violated **Crime Victims**' **Rights Act**

Ise attorneys for two girls who contend they were assaulted by billionaire and Rights/Reprints 
cted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein filed court papers on Monday claiming the 
i U.S. Attorney's office violated **the **Crime Victims**' **Rights Act**** by signing a nonprosecution agreement with Epstein 
ut notifying them, **the **Palm Beach** ****Daily News****** reported. 
Epstein served **13 months** in jail from June 2008 to July 2009 for one state count of soliciting 
an underage girl for prostitution. As a result, he is required to register as a sex offender. While 
he wasn't prosecuted for additional charges, more than 40 girls under **the age of 18** say they 
came to his home and gave him massages. During the massages, they say, he masturbated 
and sexually assaulted them. 
**Brad Edwards** and **Paul Cassell**, attorneys representing two of his alleged victims, say in 
the filing that the U.S. Attorney's office for **the Southern District** of Florida of deliberately 
misled the victims by telling them there was an ongoing investigation into their claims. 
However, they say, the office was concealing the fact that they already had signed a 
-osecution deal with Epstein. 
-ding to the motion, the U.S. Attorney's office in **January 2008** and May 2008 sent "false notification" letters in to 
in's alleged victims saying "(t)his case is currently under investigation." However, the office had signed the agreement 
Epstein in **September 2007**. 
ittorneys want a court hearing during which they will ask that the agreement be invalidated because it violated the 
is' rights. In the motion, the attorneys claim the agreement is illegal because the government did not protect the 
Iressionally mandated rights of victims before it entered this agreement." 
dge grants the request, Epstein could be charged by the U.S. Attorney's office. If he were charged and convicted on 
al charges, he could be sentenced to **10 years** to life for each charge. 
-ding to the motion, "The only reason that the (U.S. Attorney's office) concealed the existence of the non-prosecution 
r'nent from the victims was not to comply with some legal restriction, but rather to avoid a firestorm of public 
)versy that would have erupted if the sweetheart plea deal with a politically connected billionaire had been revealed." 
Valle, special counsel for the U.S. Attorney's Office Southern District of Florida, in an email to the newspaper that the 
kttorney's office will respond in court filings. 
ever, as we stated more than two years ago in **July 2008** in our response to the plaintiffs' then-emergency petition for 
cement of the **Crime Victim Rights** Act, the CVRA was not violated because no federal charges were ever filed in the 
lem District of Florida," Valle said. "Because the matter remains pending in court, it would be inappropriate at this time 
wide additional comment on the merits of the current motion."
