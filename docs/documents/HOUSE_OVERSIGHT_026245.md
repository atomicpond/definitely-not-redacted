Subject: Fwd: Keep the **March** Alive! 
**Jeffrey** --
Did you see my son's email on **Sunday**? 
I was so proud to see him speak at the Women's **March** **this weekend**, joining thousands of passionate 
Floridians who want real change in our state, and across the country. 
But we both know that change doesn't come easy. And there are a lot of folks in Tallahassee that want to 
keep things the same as usual. 
We can't afford the status quo so they can have their way. We need leadership that will bring the 
change that so many have been marching for over **the past year**. 
Can I count on you to help my son bring that change to Tallahassee? 
Click here to join his campaign **today**, and help him do the right thing for our neighbors  
across the state.

Forwarded message 
I spent **the day** with thousands of fellow Floridians, celebrating the one year anniversary of the 
Women's **March**. 
I was inspired by the crowds, their voice, and their passion.

Empowering women in the age of **Trump** is an essential part of moving this country forward. But 
that means moving forward on issues that have long been stalled -equal pay, better education, 
and a living wage. 
**In **2018****, we have the chance to move these issues forward, and I'm asking for your help in 
makins it ha en.

If the crowds we saw in St. Petersburg, **Miami**, and dozens of other cities across this country are 
any indication, we have the momentum! 
Now we need to bring it to Tallahassee. 
Sincerely,
