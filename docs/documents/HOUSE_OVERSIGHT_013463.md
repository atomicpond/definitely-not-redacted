AFFIDAVIT OF BRADLEY JAMES EDWARDS 
1. I am an attorney in good standing with **the Florida Bar** and admitted to practice in the 
**Southern District** of Florida. I am a partner in the law firm of Farmer Jaffe Weissing Edwards Fistos and 
Lehrman. 
2. I am the lead attorney currently representing "Jane Doe" in the case of Jane Doe v. 
Jeffrey Epstein, case number 08-80893 in federal Court in **the **Southern District**** of Florida. I am the lead 
attorney representing Jane Doe, whose civil complaint alleges that Epstein sexually molested her 
numerous occasions when she was a minor. 
3. Defendant Epstein has entered into a "non-prosecution agreement" (NPA) with the 
federal government for sex crimes against minors. Under that agreement, the federal government has 
agreed not to file criminal charges against Epstein for sex crimes committed against approximately thirty 
girls, including Jane Doe. In exchange, Epstein agreed to plead guilty to state law criminal charges 
involving solicitation of prostitution and procuring a minor for prostitution. The victim of the criminal 
charges to which he has pled was not Jane Doe. 
4. Under the NPA, Epstein has agreed not to contest civil liability of any of his 
approximately thirty victims — provided that the victim agrees to limit themselves to the damages 
provided by 18 U.S.C. § 2255 (currently set at $150,000). Jane Doe has not agreed to limit herself to 
pursuing only $150,000-in damages. Therefore, the terms of the NPA purport to prevent Jane Doe from 
.using the NPA to prove liability. 
5. Epstein has filed an answer to Jane Doe's complaint, in which he has invoked his Fifth 
Amendment right to silence with respect to the allegations that he molested her as a child. Epstein has 
further argued that this **Fifth Amendment** invocation is the functional equivalent of, and must be 
treated as, a specific denial of the allegations. 
6. Defendant Epstein 's deposition has been taken on several occasions, in this and other 
related cases, and he has not provided any substantive discovery whatsoever. Instead, he invoked his 
5th amendment privilege against self-incrimination when asked questions about his abuse of Jane Doe or 
other girls. 
7. Defendant Epstein has also been served with Interrogatories and requests for 
production; all requests have been met with 5th amendment assertions and Epstein has not given Jane 
Doe any substantive testimony related her allegations. 
8. Jane Doe's complaint contains a punitive damages claim, and Mr. Epstein has also 
elected to invoke the 5th Amendment on all questions that would relate to punitive damages issues, 
such as his intent when committing the crimes, his lack of remorse and his intent to recidivate. 
9. Epstein has taken Jane Doe's deposition. During that deposition he has asked numerous 
questions of Jane Doe that suggest that she is fabricating her allegation of abuse by Epstein. 
10. In addition to deposing Mr. Epstein, other attorneys and I have taken the depositions of 
his various co-conspirators (as labeled by the federal government in the NPA), including 
and Each of those individuals was employed by Epstein to bring 
him underage girls for him to molest and to ensure that he was protected from detection by law 
enforcement, and thus those individuals could likely provide general testimony that would assist Plaintiff 
in proving liability and damages, including punitive damages. However, none of these individuals were 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 013463 
present during acts of sexual abuse by Epstein. In any event, ALL of those individuals have also invoked 
their 5th amendment rights against self-incrimination, and thus have left Plaintiff with no information 
about what Epstein or other conspirators inside his house were doing during the sexual abuse of Jane 
Doe and other minors girls. This creates a serious issue for Jane Doe in proving her sexual molestation 
claim against Epstein. By its nature, sexual molestation takes place in private, with only the abuser and 
the victim typically available to testify. In this case, Epstein's abuse of Jane Doe took place in private, 
with only Epstein and Jane Doe present during the abuse. Jane Doe has no other reasonable avenues of 
discovery to provide direct proof of claim of sexual abuse by Epstein. 
11. Additionally, Mr. Epstein has recently filed a lawsuit against me personally that has no 
merit whatsoever, a fact known to Mr. Epstein and his attorneys. He filed the lawsuit against Brad 
Edwards, Scott Rothstein, and =another Epstein victim of his molestation). That lawsuit implies that 
L.M.'s civil case against him (currently pending in Florida state court) is fabricated and that and I 
have conspired to commit fraud against him (presumably that she made up the case against him, 
implying that he does not knovM. While the present subpoena before the Court has been filed by 
Jane Doe, the Court should be aware that attorneys representingMmay also file a subpoena for the 
George Rush ta
