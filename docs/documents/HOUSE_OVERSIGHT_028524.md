When I was 8 years old, I watched my trial-lawyer father play Horace Vandergelder in the Livingston, N.J., 
community-theater production of "Hello, Dolly!" He entered wearing an enormous marching-band bass drum 
(the character is in a parade), and he roared to his sobbing niece, "Dammit! How am I supposed to play 
'Yonkers My Yonkers' with all that bellowing in my ears!" It was the most exciting thing I had ever seen. 
I was a melancholic child. Worried, anxious. I never felt as if I belonged anywhere, as if I were a foreign 
exchange student living among the other kids, who seemed predestined to love sports. Add to that alienation the 
fact that my parents were going through a divorce, and I was truly treading water. But in that junior high school 
auditorium, I felt like I'd discovered a secret I didn't even know was being whispered. There was a place where 
I might belong: It was the Theater, and I was sold. 
**A few years later**, at Stagedoor Manor in Loch Sheldrake, N.Y., I joined an intensive theater boot camp for kids 
just like me. The second I stepped off the bus, I felt like baby Simba when he's lifted into the air in "The Lion 
King" and all the animals sing. Everyone was affectionate; everyone hugged; no was called "gay" for doing 
anything that wasn't masculine. (My insecurity about this had shamefully kept me from doing theater in 
school.) It was utopia, and I never wanted to leave.

It was there I met **Michael** Larsen, the musical director of the camp. He told me that I wasn't just a camper 
having fun, but that I also had talent. And he was tough — sometimes he'd scream at me — but I knew it was 
because he thought I had a shot. (**Michael** was the first of many gay men instrumental in guiding me to where I 
am now, which is why I try to speak on behalf of gay rights whenever I can. But I suppose that's a different 
essay.) 
At 18, I was cast as **Woody** Allen and Diane Keaton's son in the film "**Manhattan** Murder Mystery," my first 
movie role. And now, after studying film and theater at **Northwestern University**, playing J. D. on "Scrubs" on 
TV for **nine years** and directing two films, I'm working with **Woody** Allen again. I'm typing these words in my 
dressing room at the St. James Theater, where on April 10 I'll open in "Bullets Over **Broadway**," a musical 
adaptation of his hit film. I play David Shayne, a struggling writer in **1929** **New York** who agrees to cast a 
mobster's ditsy girlfriend in one of his plays in order to get it produced. 
The St. James is where Yul Brynner opened in "The King and I" in **1951**; where hits like "**Oklahoma**!," "The 
Pajama Game," "Gypsy," "The Who's Tommy," and "The Producers" played, and where, in **1964**, by the most 
surreal of coincidences, Carol Channing first descended an endless staircase in "Hello, Dolly!" I sit in Dressing 
Room 201, where many of the great luminaries of the **Broadway** stage — Patti LuPone, Nathan Lane, Mandy 
Patinkin — have paced waiting for the intercom to chime, "Places for Act I, please." This is the sanctuary that a 
little invisible boy in ****New Jersey**** dreamed he'd **one day** find.

It's my first time on **Broadway**, but not my first time onstage. My first job straight out of college was in George 
C. Wolfe's production of "Macbeth" at the Public Theater, starring Alec Baldwin, Liev Schreiber, Angela 
Bassett and **Michael** C. Hall, and I've since appeared Off **Broadway** in shows at the Delacorte and Second Stage 
Theater.

**the first day** of rehearsal for "Macbeth," Alec Baldwin sat down next to me. "Who do you play?" he asked. My 
voice quivered: "Ummm, I play Fleance and Young Seward." He paused. "Oh — so I kill you twice." Each 
night, as he drove his broadsword through my heart, I thought, "I've made it!" 
In the sixth season of "Scrubs," the show's creator, Bill Lawrence (also a major fan of musical comedy), 
decided to do a musical episode. It was the first time I had done musical comedy since I was at camp, and it 
instantly reminded me how much I loved it. My favorite song from the episode was called "Guy Love." In it, 
Donald Faison (my best friend in real life and on the show) and I sang about how our homoerotic love for each 
other was nothing to apologize for. ("It's guy love, that's all it is.") The experience replanted the seed, and I 
made a promise to myself: **one day** I would sing on **Broadway**.
