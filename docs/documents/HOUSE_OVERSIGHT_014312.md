**Financials**: buy **XLF** Mar17 $22 call with $26 KO for $0.87 with full premium rebate on KO

Importance: High 
Our **Financials** Conference was **this week** and client attendance was up by 66% from **last year**. Yes, banks/**Financials** 
might pull back at some point after this run-up but we would be buyers on any pullbacks and we continue to see further 
upside from multiple expansion and earnings growth. Our analyst raised her price targets by —11% across the board. The 
long term rotation from bonds and **div** stocks into sectors like **Financials** is only beginning. 
**Vol** is higher on **the week**; what prices well now: 
Buy the **XLF** **March 2017** $22 call with $26 Knock-Out (continuous) for $0.87, with a full premium 
rebate if knock-out occurs. 
This prices attractively given flat call skew and if **XLF** breaches $26 and this knocks out, at least you get your 
premium back. 
Please find our **Financials** report attached. 
Future of **Financials** conference hosted 90 public and private companies at our Future of **Financials** conference. We are 
raising our price objectives across most of our names. Three primary reasons why we think there is upside remaining 
after the recent rally: 1) an improved outlook on both activity levels and interest rates, driving revenue upside; 2) 
potentially lower regulatory burden, particularly as new supervisory leadership can come with the new administration; 
and 3) relatively lighter positioning in US **Financials** vs. other sectors. (**Erika Najarian**)

Subject: RE: **Financials** trade for **Monday** 
We continue to see buyers of **XLF** **today**. Funds are underweight **Financials** in all regions, valuations are 
reasonable, earnings are improving and **Financials** tend to outperform when bond yields rise. 
**Vol** is higher **today** — refreshed pricing below. 
Buy an **XLF** 17March2017 call spread: 
• Buy the 105% call / sell a 110% call with a 115% at-expiry knock-in 
• Total premium: 1.86% 
Global Positioning in Stocks: Nigel Tupper notes the 4000 funds in our "Positioning in Stocks" analysis  
are more underweight **Financials**, on average, than any other sector and are underweight this sector in all 
regions of the world. If earnings continue to improve and yield rise, which is often the case in an upturn in our 
Global Wave, then the unloved **Financials** sector has the potential to continue to outperform. 
Global Quant Panorama: "Bearish on Bonds" stocks (which tend to move in the opposite direction to  
bond yields) tend to outperform our "Bullish On Bonds" when bond yields rise. The sectors that tend to 
perform best as bond yields rise are Energy, Tech, Materials, Banks, and Diversified **Financials**. Of these 
sectors, the laggards **this year** have been Banks and Diversified **Financials**. With a PE of 15.9x and a PB of 
2.0x, Global valuations are reasonable. Also, Risk is near all-time lows in terms of PE in most regions. Now 
that macro and earnings data have triggered the beginning of a rotation, Value becomes very relevant.

Subject: **Financials** trade for **Monday** 
It's not too late to buy **Financials** as a medium term trade. They've run up a lot **this week** but we're getting 
endless calls from generalists asking which banks to buy — there is still more upside to the sector. Banks also 
provide some offset to your bonds if interest rates continue to move. Our **Financials** sector specialist thinks **XLF** 
could have another 20-25% upside given its many levers to the **Trump** trade: less regulation, higher interest 
rates/steeper yield curve, higher **Vol**, economic growth, etc. The regional banks are asset sensitive and more of a 
pure play on a rates move but we view the larger cap banks as having even more upside to the **Trump** Trade 
given the above points. 
Buy an **XLF** 17March2017 call spread: 
• Buy the 105% call / sell a 110% call with a 115% at-expiry knock-in 
• Total premium: 1.75% 
All eyes are on **Sunday**'s 60 Minutes interview with **Trump**. Market is pricing that all regulations will be rolled 
back (very optimistic). Any hint that this is not true could lead to pullback on **Monday**. 
Note on tech: we're seeing FANG used as a source of funds with the rotation from growth into value. There's 
also the tax read-through: tech is already relatively tax advantaged @ 22%; Industrials are at 30%, **Financials** at 
29%. **next year**, tech could benefit from a repatriation tax holiday but that is viewed as more of a Q1/Q2 trade. 
More thoughts on **Financials**: 
With respect to the economy, the market is certainly indicating that there will be a large fiscal stimulus which 
may send US growth higher and that's a good thing for **Financials** for a wide variety of reasons, from
