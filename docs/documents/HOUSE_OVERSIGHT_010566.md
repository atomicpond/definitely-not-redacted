﻿IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE 15TH 
**Judicial Circuit** IN AND FOR PALM 
BEACH COUNTY, FLORIDA 
Case No. :50 2009 CA 040800XXXXMBAG 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Plaintiff, 
SCOTT ROTHSTEIN, individually, and 
**Bradley J. Edwards**, individually, 
Defendants, 
STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED FACTS  
Defendant **Bradley J. Edwards**, Esq., offers the following specific facts as the undisputed 
material facts in this case. Each of the following facts is numbered separately and individually to 
facilitate Epstein's required compliance with Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.510(c) ("The adverse party shall 
identify . . . any summary judgment evidence on which the adverse party relies."). All 
referenced exhibits and attachments have previously been filed with the Court and provided to 
Epstein. 
Sexual Abuse of Children By Epstein  
1. Defendant Epstein has a sexual preference for young children. Deposition of 
Jeffrey Epstein, Mar. 17, 2010, at 110 (hereinafter "Epstein Depo.") (Deposition Attachment 
#1).1 
When questioned about this subject at his deposition, Epstein invoked his **Fifth Amendment** right to 
remain silent rather than make an incriminating admission. Accordingly, Edwards is entitled to the 
adverse inference against Epstein that, had Epstein answered, the answer would have been unfavorable to 
him. "[I]t is well-settled that the **Fifth Amendment** does not forbid adverse inferences against parties to 
2. Epstein repeatedly sexually assaulted more than forty (40) young girls on 
numerous occasions **between 2002 and 2005** in his mansion in **West Palm Beach**, Florida. These 
sexual assaults included vaginal penetration. Epstein abused many of the girls dozens if not 
hundreds of times. Epstein Depo. at 109 ("Q: How many times have you engaged in oral sex 
with females under the age of 18?" A: [Invocation of the **Fifth Amendment**]); Deposition of Jane 
Doe, September 24, 2009 and continued March 11, 2010, at 527 (minor girl sexually abused at 
least 17 times by Epstein) (hereinafter "Jane Doe Depo") (Deposition Attachment #2); id. 564-67 
(vaginal penetration by Epstein with his finger), 568 (vaginal penetration by Epstein with a 
massager); Deposition of L.M., September 24, 2009, at 73 (hereinafter "L.M. Depo") 
(Deposition Attachment #3) (describing the manner in which Epstein abused her beginning when 
LM was 13 years old, touching her vagina with his fingers and vibrator) at 74, line 12-13 (she 
was personally molested by Epstein more than 50 times), at 164, line 19-23 and 141, line 12-13 
and 605, line 3-6 (describing that in addition to being personally molested by Epstein she was 
paid $200 per underage girl she brought Epstein and she brought him more than seventy (70) 
underage girls - she told him that she did not want to bring him any more girls and he insisted 
that she continue to bring him underage girls); Deposition of E.W., May 6, 2010 (hereinafter 
"E.W. Depo") (Deposition Attachment #4) at 115-116, 131 and 255 (describing Epstein's abuse 
of her beginning at age 14 when he paid her for touching her vagina, inserting his fingers and 
civil actions when they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence offered against them." Baxter 
v. Paltnigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 318 (1976); accord Vasquez v. State, 777 So.2d 1200, 1203 (Fla. App. 
2001). The reason for this rule "is both logical and utilitarian. A party may not trample upon the rights of 
others and then escape the consequences by invoking a constitutional privilege — at least not in a civil 
setting." Fraser v. Security and II1V. Corp., 615 So.2d 841, 842 (Fla. App. 1993).

using a vibrator and he also paid her $200 for each other underage female E.W. brought him to 
molest. She brought him between 20 and 30 underage females); Deposition of Jane Doe #4, date 
(hereinafter "Jane Doe #4 Depo") (Deposition Attachment #5) at 32-34, and 136 (she describes 
first being taken to Epstein at 15 years old, "Being fingered by him, having him use a vibrator on 
[me], grabbing my nipples, smelling my butt, jerking off in front of me, licking my cut, several 
times."). 
3. At all relevant times Edwards has had a good faith basis to conclude and did 
conclude2 that Epstein was able to access a large number of underage girls through a pyramid 
abuse scheme in which he paid underage victims $200-$300 cash for each other underage victim 
that she brought to him. See Palm Beach Police Incident Report at 87 (hereinafter "Incident 
Report") (Exhibit "A").3 The Palm Beach Police Incident Report details Epstein's scheme for 
molesting underage females. Among other things, the Incident Report outlines some of the 
experiences of other Epstein victims. When S.G, a 14 year old minor at the time, was brought to 
Epstein's home, she was taken upstairs by a woman she believed to be Epstein's assistant. The 
woman started to fix up the room, putting covers on the massage table and bringing lotions out. 
The "assistant" then left the room and told S.G. that Epstein would be up in a second. Epstein
