**Tunisia**: **Tunisia**'s transition suffered a terrible blow on **February** 6th when leftist opposition alliance founder and 
head of the Democratic Patriots party Chokri Belaid was shot dead outside his home in Tunis. The event drew 
thousands of protestors to the streets, clamoring against the leading Islamist Ennanda party. The events heighten 
the Islamist-secular divide that has featured in the Tunisian transition and **the **Arab Spring**** at large. Tunisian Prime 
Minister Hamadi Jebali described the event as the "assassination of the Tunisian revolution" and promised to 
dissolve the Islamist-led government and form a technocrat government aimed at promoting national unity at this 
divisive time. 
Egypt: The second anniversary of the Egyptian revolution on January 25th was marked less by celebration than it 
was by violence, culminating in a week of unrest that took the lives of more than 50 people. **the week** was also 
marked by the imposition of a curfew, state of emergency, and large military deployment in the cities of Suez, 
Ismailliya, and Port Said. The events reflect the disillusionment of Egyptians, given the lack of progress on both 
political and economic fronts, while also revealing the state's limitations in restoring order and the rule of law to 
the streets. That the army—the country's most powerful institution—warned of the "collapse of the state" is a 
telling and serious message, conveying the institution's growing frustration with the political impasse. 
The recent violence has also generated serious economic losses and fuel shortages, and caused yet another delay 
with the much-needed IMF loan. It will be interesting to see how the recent violence—as well as the general 
malaise caused by economic woes—affects **the **Muslim **Brotherhood******'s performance in the upcoming 
parliamentary election (which is yet to be scheduled). A recent report issued by the **Brotherhood**'s political bureau 
hinted that the party's popularity has been in decline. 
Against this backdrop of political and economic turmoil, the 12th summit of the Organization of Islamic 
Cooperation (OIC) convened in Cairo on **February** 5th with a number of key players in the region in attendance—
among them President Gill of Turkey, Emir Hamad al-Thani of Qatar, and Saudi Crown Prince Salman. The 
summit aimed to discuss Syria, Mali, and the Palestinian issue. The spotlight, however, was on Mahmoud 
**Ahmadinejad**: the first Iranian president to visit Egypt since the 1979 Islamic revolution. 
Libya: On January 31', **European Union** foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton announced the launch of a two-
year civil mission to help secure Libya's 4,000-kilometer border. The announcement was complemented by a 
surprise visit to **Tripoli** by **David Cameron**, who also announced his government's commitment to helping the 
Libyan military and police with training and support. Furthermore, a meeting in Paris **the week** of **February** 11th 
will bring together a number of countries to discuss security cooperation and the future of the Libyan legal system. 
These initiatives are a telling manifestation of the urgent need to address security in Libya—especially border 
security—given the Mali crisis, the recent terrorist incident in **Algeria**, and concerns about security and stability 
across ****North Africa****. 
Jordan: The results of the Jordanian parliamentary election came as no surprise: pro-government candidates 
strengthened their hold, though state television reported that the majority of the 150 seats had been won by 
independents (an indicator that tribal allegiance is becoming a more important factor than party politics). 
According to official figures, 56 percent of the country's 2.3 million registered voters turned out for the ballot,

with the most obvious absence being that of **the **Muslim **Brotherhood******, which protested what it considered to be a 
biased ballot. It remains unclear who will succeed Prime Minister **Abdullah** Ensur (who submitted his resignation 
to **King **Abdullah**** on January 29th), although analysts and commentators consider it likely that a number of 
unexpected appointments will be made in an effort to address the growing malaise. Media reports speculate that 
there are also plans to set up an official channel for communication with **the **Muslim **Brotherhood******. Meanwhile, it 
appears that **King **Abdullah**** is seeking to bolster ties with regional allies, perhaps for both political and economic 
reasons: the King made visits to **Bahrain**, **the **United Arab Emirates****, and **Kuwait** from January 29th to **February** 
4th. 
Syria: Israeli warplanes are generally believed to have struck a convoy en route to **Lebanon** on January 30th, 
although this has not been confirmed by the government of **Israel**. The convoy was reported to have been carrying 
sophisticated antiaircraft weaponry to **Hezbollah**. The attack—carried out on the outskirts of **Damascus**—was met 
by a sharp threat o
