From: **Lisa New 
Sent**: 12/2/2015 3:17:58 PM 
To: **Jeffrey Epstein** [jeeyacation@gmail.com] 
Subject: **Poetry Update** and **Thank You 
Importance**: **High 
Dear Jeffrey**, 
May I drop by before the New Year (perhaps on the 9th, or on **the 17th or 18th**?) to get your advice 
about my renewal of the Templeton campaign, and also my needs in **the coming year** for Poetry in 
America? Below is the letter I'm sending out to my friends and supporters, and at the bottom a 
message just for you.... 
-Lisa 
That you are receiving this letter means that you are among a special community of friends whose 
support— financial, moral, intellectual, logistical— has allowed my initiative, Poetry in America, to 
realize what seemed, a year ago, almost certainly too ambitious a vision. That vision was to 
produce the highest quality educational video on American poetry, creating a body of 
humanities content capable of reaching a broad community of learners: formal and informal, 
online and residential, young and old, American and international. And it was to 
begin— rapidly— to disseminate and distribute our work. 
Whether you donated to Poetry in America through Filmmaker's Collaborative (our 501c3 fiscal 
sponsor), through Harvard, or through WGBH; whether you appeared on camera or talked an elusive 
friend into appearing on camera to discuss a poem; whether you lent us your film crew, or provided 
overnight use of your hotel suite or apartment or of your whole skyscraper; whether you highlighted 
our work on your stage, or talked your colleagues into becoming corporate sponsors; whether you 
flew to Boston to install state-of-the-art editing and video storage equipment, or asked your children's 
school to let us film there; whether you encouraged your family foundation to take an interest in the 
project, or gave us a lesson in IP, in licensing, in the rudiments of finance, or of distribution; whether 
you praised, or gave timely, much-needed criticism— you enabled what we have done. 
Here's what we have to report, and to show, a year later, thanks to your help. Links offer sneak peeks 
of works -in-progress across the full portfolio of Poetry in America projects. 
• The first **eight-episode season** of the public television series Poetry in America (a co-
production between WGBH, Emmy Award-winning filmmaker David Grubin, and my own new 
production company, Verse Video), is now fully funded and in production, with episodes featuring Bill  
Clinton, **Herbie Hancock** and **Sonia Sanchez** on **Langston Hughes**, Frank Gehry on Carl Sandburg, 
Katie Couric on **Elizabeth Bishop**, Nas on Whitman, and many more scheduled for nationwide launch 
in 2017. 
• Poetry in America's many initiatives to reach ****Middle and High School** Teachers** and their 
students are taking root. **Our first online course for **Middle and High School**** Teachers, Poetry of 
the City, will launch this Spring with **the **Harvard Graduate School** of Education**. Companion 
materials to this course will be made available for free on **PBS LearningMedia**. This course is 
designed to meet the needs of **English Language Arts** and **Social Studies** teachers in the US and 
internationally. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028943 
• We are eager to begin production of The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky. Designed, too, for 
****Middle and High School** Teachers**, The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky will draw **English Language Arts** 
instruction into dialogue with science, and will include extraordinary footage of the natural world, 
conversations with poets, scholars, and scientists as well as footage shot in class and in the field with 
great teachers. 
• **A recent partnership with ****Greenwich Country Day** School** and the ****Success Academy****** Network 
of charter schools will provide a base for the production of a new collection of classroom-ready 
educational material on The Poetry of Art Sport, and Play. This collection will include discussions 
on poems filmed everywhere from sports fields to Broadway theaters, and will feature dancers, 
athletes, fashion designers, and more. 
• With a growing archive of footage capturing teachers and students reading American poems, 
we are eager to expand our reach and move into America's schools, disseminating, testing, 
and learning from teachers and students using our materials. We hope to be able to begin work 
evaluating the impact of poetry on literacy levels and character development and, eventually, to 
produce a full suite of materials that foster character development along with intellectual growth. 
Working closely with such partners as **The Nantucket Project**, ****Nautilus Magazine****, The Aspen Ideas 
Festival, and The Big Think, and, of course, HarvardX, Harvard's provider of free open online 
courses, we are continuing to create rich educational media on poetry for adult learners and 
lifelong learners. These materials include short form videos such as this one on **Robert Pinsky's**  
"Shirt" (as featured in **The New Yorker**), and, this spring, the sixth module of the free seven-part 
Poetry in America MOOC, which ha
