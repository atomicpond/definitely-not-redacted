On December 18, **2015**, **President Obama** signed into law a bill that significantly reforms the provisions 
of **the Internal Revenue Code** that were originally added 35 years ago by the Foreign Investment in 
Real Property Tax Act of **1980** (**FIRPTA**). The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of **2015** (the 
"PATH Act") also includes extensions of a number of tax relief provisions that expired at the end of 
**2015**. The PATH Act makes foreign capital investment in U.S. real estate, energy and infrastructure 
assets more attractive by expanding certain exemptions from **FIRPTA** and clarifying the application of 
certain **FIRPTA** provisions to REITs and their shareholders. 
I. FOREIGN PENSION FUNDS EXEMPTED FROM **FIRPTA** TAXATION 
One of the most significant provisions of the PATH Act is the addition of a complete exemption from 
**FIRPTA** for "qualified foreign pension funds" and "entities" wholly owned by such funds, effective on 
the date of enactment. A foreign pension fund is "qualified" if it is subject to government regulation 
and certain reporting requirements in its home jurisdiction, is established to provide retirement or 
pension benefits to participants or beneficiaries that are current or former employees, has no greater 
than 5 percent beneficiaries, and enjoys tax benefits on either contributions or investment income in 
its home jurisdiction. The new exemption applies to direct investments and investments made 
through partnerships (including private equity funds). The PATH Act provides for certain details to be 
addressed by Treasury Regulations. It appears that the "entities" eligible for the **FIRPTA** exemption 
could include a U.S. or foreign "blocker" corporation that is wholly owned by a qualifying foreign 
pension fund. This exemption will, for the first time, permit foreign pension funds, including some 
governmental funds, to hold control positions in REITs without losing their **FIRPTA** exemption. 
Note that the regular rules of **the Internal Revenue Code** other than **FIRPTA** still would apply to the 
foreign pension fund. Therefore, a foreign pension fund that invested in a partnership that was 
engaged in a U.S. business (real estate or non-real estate) would still be subject to U.S. federal income 
tax on its share of the partnership's "effectively connected" U.S. business income in the same manner 
as other non-U.S. persons making an investment in a U.S. business partnership. 
Here are some examples of what can be done in light of the changes made by the PATH Act: 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 026830 
A. Raw Land Investment. A qualifying foreign pension fund invests in a partnership that buys raw land 
in **the United States**. (This could be a vacant lot, timberland, oil and gas or mineral property, or other 
property interests that qualify for treatment as real property for federal income tax purposes.) The 
investment is a capital asset, as the partnership is not engaged in business. The partnership later sells 
the property to a developer, or the pension fund sells its partnership interest. Under prior law, the 
foreign pension fund's non-business capital gain would automatically be subject to US federal income 
tax because of **FIRPTA**. Under the new law, the foreign pension fund's long-term or short-term capital 
gain is exempt from U.S. income tax and **FIRPTA** withholding because **FIRPTA** does not apply. 
B. Equity Kicker Mortgage Loan Investment. A foreign pension fund acquires an ownership interest 
in a mortgage loan secured by U.S. real property. The loan includes stated interest plus an equity 
kicker (e.g., additional interest equal to a share of gain realized on sale of the property). Such an 
equity kicker loan is treated as a U.S. real property interest under **FIRPTA**. Under prior law, gain 
realized by the foreign pension fund upon sale of
