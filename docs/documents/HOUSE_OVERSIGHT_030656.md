BREAKING NEWS 
At least six of President Trump's advisers, including **Steve Bannon** and Reince 
**Priebus**, used private email accounts for government business 
**Monday**, September 25, **2017** 8:08 PM EDT 
At least six of President Trump's closest advisers occasionally used private email addresses 
to discuss **White **HOUSE**** matters, current and former officials said on **Monday**. 
Officials are supposed to use government emails for their official duties so their 
conversations are available to the public and those conducting oversight. But it is not illegal 
for **White **HOUSE**** officials to use private email accounts as long as they forward work-related 
messages to their work accounts so they can be preserved. 
During the **2016** presidential race, Mr. Trump repeatedly harped on Hillary Clinton's use of a 
private account as secretary of state, making it a centerpiece of his campaign and using it to 
paint her as untrustworthy. "We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval 
Office," Mr. Trump said **last year**. His campaign rallies often boiled over with chants of 
"Lock her up!"
