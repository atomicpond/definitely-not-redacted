The 7.8% intraday peak-to-trough decline in US equities between September 21st and October 11th 
has rattled investor confidence. Numerous headlines of stock market "carnage" have further eroded 
their confidence. As a result, some of our clients have asked whether this drop signifies the beginning 
of the end of a nearly 10-year bull market. 
We do not think so. So far, this pullback is actually smaller than the two prior downdrafts we 
experienced in late January and in mid-March, neither of which derailed the US economy nor the bull 
market. The steady factors we highlighted in our annual Outlook—such as economic growth, benign 
inflation, robust earnings, and low probability of recession—have not dissipated. Furthermore, while 
the investor focus has shifted to the risks around the unsteady undertow, most of these factors are, 
on balance, less concerning today than they were at the beginning of 2018. 
Of course, that is not the case across all geopolitical concerns. While trade tensions with Mexico and 
Canada have abated, those with China have certainly deteriorated and will continue to do so for the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026894 
foreseeable future. But, in aggregate, there has been more improvement than deterioration, in our 
view. 
In this Sunday Night Insight, we will provide a brief update on the steady factors and unsteady 
undertow. We then conclude with our view that the steady factors will likely continue to win this tug-of-
war between the two. 
Steady Factors 
While the headlines warn of equity market carnage, the facts do not support such alarming headlines. 
The S&P 500 is still up 5.1% on a year-to-date total return basis and financial conditions remain at 
easier levels today than they did when **the ****Federal Reserve****** began this tightening cycle in 2015, 
despite the recent decline in equities and 0.76 percentage point increase in 10-year Treasury yields 
year-to-date. Most importantly, as highlighted by ****Federal Reserve**** Chairman, Jerome Powell, we are 
in "extraordinary times" of steady growth and low inflation. 
Economic Growth 
Economic growth remains firm in the US. Both the Institute for Supply Management leading indexes 
for manufacturing and non-manufacturing remain at very strong levels. Current activity indicators of 
real GDP growth average about 3.5% for the third quarter and closer to 4% for the fourth quarter. 
Forecasts for third quarter real GDP average 3.8% and fourth quarter forecasts are about 
2.8%. While growth is slowing from the 4.2% estimate of the second quarter, it is still forecast to be 
above trend and we believe a modest slowdown is certainly preferable to continued growth at a pace 
that was likely unsustainable and possibly even inflationary. 
In aggregate, the economic data since the intraday peak of US equities on September 21st does not 
point to any worrisome slowdown in GDP growth or the pace of employment. In fact, while the recent 
134K increase in non-farm payrolls was less than expectations, revisions to earlier months offset the 
modest headline miss and the unemployment rate still fell to 3.7%. Furthermore, this 134k increase 
is above the estimated sustainable level of employment growth based on population growth and 
changes in labor force participation, which our colleagues in Goldman Investment Research estimate 
is around 96k. Importantly, a modest slowdown in the 3-month average of non-farm payrolls, which 
currently stands at a very robust 190k jobs, is more likely to keep inflation in check. 
Robust Earnings and Buybacks 
Continued above-trend economic growth is supporting solid corporate fundamentals. While many are 
quick to dismiss this strength to US tax reform, it is only half the story. Earnings before interest and 
taxes (EBIT) expanded by a very healthy 12% in the first half of this year and are expected to grow by 
double-digits again in the third quarter. This robust organic profit growth is also fueling sizable 
corporate buybacks—a key source of equity market support. Our colleagues on the corporate 
buyback desk expect the highest dollar amount for buybacks o
