Hi **Bob** (and hello **Jeffrey**), 
; ****Jeffrey** Epstein** [jeevacation@gmail.com] 
I would be happy at the moment not to be on another mailing list. There are just too many different things I am trying to 
attend to (including imprinted green beards),

Subject: <no subject> 
dear men 
i am writing you both because i am attaching a still not-quite-complete response to Peter Richerson, a gene-culture co-
evolutionist—without the genes 
i do so because four lines down i tell the "Gruterites"—****Gordon** **Getty****'s echo chamber—that i have added you two to the 
list 
so here is your chance to say "no way" and i will delete that from the message and likewise not ask Gruter's assistant to 
add your names to the list 
having said that, i find **Gordon**'s missives much less burdensome than those from **Edge** and certainly without the 
egomaniacal nonsense that infects **John Brockman**—the key is to get the brightest minds in a room and have them tell 
each other what they think is most important—or some such nonsense 
neither **David** nor i can think of a single scientific advance achieved that way—most of what we do is simply 
concentrated sustained thought directed toward the foundations of a problem 
i doubt **Jeffrey** has made a huge amount of money via the **Edge** program 
unless you say otherwise, i will shortly send you the key **Getty** missives in which he asserts, i believe correctly, that 
**Trump** is an archetypal narcissistic psychopath—or whatever the precise term is—and that he must be opposed with full 
force on that basis 
meanwhile, **David** has heard plenty about you **Jeffrey**, a financial/mathematical mind of exceptional quality and you 
should know that **David** is one of the very top evolutionary geneticists still breathing and my teacher on every detail 
large and small 
in haste and all best
