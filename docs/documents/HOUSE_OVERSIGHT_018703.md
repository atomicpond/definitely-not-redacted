﻿The Game: All Things **Trump**
Andres Serrano
"In the history of science the collector of specimens
preceded the zoologist and followed the exponents of
natural theology and magic….. However lowly, the work
of the collector must be done, before he can proceed to
the higher scientific tasks of classification, analysis,
experiment and theory making."
Aldous Huxley from Heaven and Hell
Before Donald **Trump** was President, he was Donald **Trump**.
This is a portrait of that man.
In his first non-photography based installation, Andres Serrano
takes us on a curious and insightful tour for a closer look at who
Donald **Trump** is.
In a relatively short period of **eight weeks** with a determination
and competitive ferocity worthy of its subject, the artist has
amassed a collection of over 500 objects produced by or for
Donald **Trump**.
The collection is telling and varies from objects as mundane as
shirts, ties, suits, hats, jackets, ice buckets, Teddy Bears and
miniature screwdriver sets made for Donald **Trump**, his brand,
his casinos, his hotels, to **Trump** Tea, **Trump** Coffee, **Trump** Ice
Water, **Trump** Coca-Cola, **Trump** 7-Up, **Trump** Snapple, and
the more exotic $1,000 **Trump** Steaks (“The Best!”), **Trump**
Vodka packed in 24 carat gold plated bottles, a **Trump** deodorant
named “**Success**” and a **Trump** cologne called “Empire.”
In addition to the merchandise for **Trump** Plaza, **Trump** Harrah’s
Casino, **Trump** Marina, **Trump** Castle, **Trump** Tai Mahal,
******Trump** University**** and ****Trump** Shuttle** there are casino chips,
boxing invites, concert invites and many many more objects all
bearing the name “**Trump**.”
This colorful collection is mostly self-explanatory but the artist
plans to present each object with a museum-like label not unlike
in a curiosity cabinet or an anthropological study room.
Of particular interest are more than fifty magazines with Donald
**Trump** on the cover. Although, most of the magazines are ten,
twenty or more years old, there are some more recent ones
including a copy of The **Atlantic** from **June 2016** with the cover
story, “The Mind Of Donald **Trump**,” **Time Magazine**’s issue
“Deal with it” from August 21, **2015** and another **Time Magazine**
dated March 14, 2016 with the words “bully, showman, party
crasher and demagogue” written across Donald **Trump**’s face.
All three magazines are signed by Donald **Trump**.
Also included are several high priced special edition items made
for VIP’s such as a beautiful Taj Mahal leather jacket and a Taj
Mahal Golf Bag and Clubs as well as a **1994** **Trump** Castle Casino
Birthday Invitation titled, “**Trump**, Lord Of The Financial Jungle.”
The centerpiece of the installation is a sizable portrait of Donald
**Trump** taken by Andres Serrano in **2004** for his “**America**” series
and a giant rotating sculpture below it. The sculpture, which is
more than 10 feet tall, is the word, EGO, spelled vertically, an
elegant sign that once greeted visitors at the entrance of **Trump**’s
Taj Mahal Casino's Ego Lounge.
Finally, there are several board games including “**Trump**
Monopoly,” “The Apprentice Game” and “**Trump**: The Game.”
The premise of “The Game” is stated on the box.
“It’s not whether you win or lose, it’s whether you win.”
There are different versions of “The Game,” including one in
French, all to be laid out in several locations in the gallery under
glass.
What kind of game was it, or is it? Who wins, and who loses?
That’s for the audience to decide. The artist prefers to stay neutral.
“It’s a portrait of a man painted with his own brushes,” says
Andres Serrano.
