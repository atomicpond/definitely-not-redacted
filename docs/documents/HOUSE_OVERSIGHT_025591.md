Caroline Kennedy Selling 93 Acres on Martha's Vineyard 
Caroline Kennedy, the only surviving child of the late President **John F. Kennedy**, listed for sale about 90 acres 
of land in Martha's Vineyard, a resort island off the **Massachusetts** coast. 
Two waterfront parcels in the town of Aquinnah are on the market -- a 39.5-acre (16-hectare) property available 
for $20 million, and a 53.5-acre piece for $25 million, according to the listings for 6 Red Gate Farm and 8 Red 
Gate Farm. 
"An exclusive waterfront property with incredible views of Squibnocket Pond, with further views over towering 
sand dunes to the Atlantic Ocean," the listing for 6 Red Gate Farm reads. "Plenty of privacy with varied 
topography and easy pond access. Yours to create a marvelous estate." 
The land is part of a 366-acre stretch that has been private since Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis bought it in **1978**, 
said John O'Connell, broker and owner of Vineyard Realty Group in Edgartown, **Massachusetts**. 
The property is "a piece of the island that very few people have seen," said O'Connell, who isn't involved in the 
sale. 
Corporate records for Red Gate Farm LLC, which owns the land, lists Edwin A. Schlossberg as the person 
responsible for the parcels. He is the husband of Caroline Kennedy, who is expected to be Obama's choice as 
the next U.S. ambassador to **Japan**.
