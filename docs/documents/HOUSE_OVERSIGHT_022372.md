﻿Election 2016: Trump Wins Presidency,
Republicans Hold Congress
Washington Council Ernst & Young 9 **November 2016**
After the most tumultuous and unpredictable campaign in modern history, Republican Donald Trump
upset Democrat Hillary Clinton to win the Presidency, claiming at least 279 electoral votes (270
electoral votes to win) to Clinton’s 228, with results in Arizona, Michigan, and ****New Hampshire**** still
outstanding, according to **the Associated Press**. The popular vote margin remains close, with Trump
currently trailing by approximately 200,000 votes out of a total of almost 120 million votes that have
been counted. Clinton’s blue wall of support was pierced by Trump with unexpected wins in
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. He also won the needed battleground states of Florida, Ohio, and North
Carolina. With fewer losses than expected, Republicans will retain their majorities in the House and
Senate, thereby controlling both ends of **Pennsylvania Avenue**.
Clinton, who called Trump last night to concede the race, said this morning, “I offered to work with him
[Trump] on behalf of our country” and “our nation is more deeply divided than we thought,” but went on
to say, “we stand together…and our best days are still ahead of us.” In his remarks shortly before 3:00
AM, President-elect Trump said, “It is time to bind the wounds of division. It is time for us to come
together as one united America.” He went on to say that it was “not a campaign, but an incredible
movement.” And, alluding to his policy agenda, Trump said we “would be working together to begin the
task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream.” Trump has touted an agenda of
revitalizing the economy and promoting job growth by reforming the tax code, rebuilding America’s
infrastructure, repealing and replacing “Obamacare,” and being “tough” on immigration and in
renegotiating international trade agreements.
Maintaining the Senate majority will give Republicans the ability to set the agenda in the
Senate. However, bipartisan cooperation still will be necessary to achieve meaningful policy
accomplishments as Senate rules generally require a 60-vote threshold for movement on most
issues. An early challenge may be filling **the **Supreme Court**** vacancy created by the death of Antonin
Scalia in early 2016 – one that could spark fireworks on Capitol Hill and across the country’s highly
charged political environment. How Republicans, Democrats, and Trump navigate through the process
of nominating and confirming a new Justice to **the **Supreme Court**** is likely to set the tone in the Senate
for **the next two years**. The nature of Speaker Paul Ryan’s relationship with President-elect Trump and
his often unruly House Republican Conference is not clear at this time. However, the House Republican
“Better Way” agenda, which was developed in consultation with the Trump campaign, is now a focal
point for congressional action.

Election results
With Republicans set to control **the White House**, Senate, and House
of Representatives for the session of Congress beginning in January
2017, the lame-duck session of the current Congress between now
and **the end of this year** seems likely to be limited to keeping the
government funded beyond the expiration of the current continuing
resolution on December 9, 2016. President-elect Trump and the
Republican Congress are certain to provide ambitious policy agendas
with plenty of proposals to analyze and the need for significant
legislative activity. However, it remains to be seen where Democrats
and Republicans, particularly in the Senate, will be able to forge
compromise.
With 24 of the 34 Senate seats up for election on November 8th held
by Republicans, and many of those seats quite vulnerable, retaining
control is a major victory for Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell (R-KY) and his Republican majority. Currently,
Republicans are expected to hold at least 51 seats in the new
congress, with Senator Kelly Ayotte’s (R-NH) reelection bid in New
Hampshire still undecided. In Louisiana, State Treasurer John
Kennedy (R) received 25 percent of the vote and Foster Campbell
(D), a member of the Louisiana Public Service Commission, received
17% in a crowded 24 candidate “jungle primary” to advance to a
runoff election to be held on December 10, 2016. Senior House
**Ways and **Means Committee**** member Charles Boustany (R-LA) fell
just short in his quest to make the two-candidate runoff receiving
15% of the vote. While the Louisiana seat is technically undecided,
the state went strongly Republican in the Presidential election and
Kennedy is heavily favored to hold the seat.
Illinois Senator Mark Kirk (R-IL) lost his race to Rep. Tammy
Duckworth (D-IL). In Indiana, Rep.
