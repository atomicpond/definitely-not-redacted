Executive Summary


For **Haiti** to become an economically independent nation from donors and foreign aid there needs to be support for private industry to establish itself and flourish.  At one point in its history, **Haiti** was a market leader in the textile industry supplying quality products. Currently there is an opportunity to provide sustainable employment for Haitians with the right training to develop an industry to serve as a catalyst to catapult the country out of the stigmatism of a third world country. There is a need for work to be done, such as construction of homes, infrastructure, etc.

**Haiti** is one of the lowest-income countries in the Western hemisphere. The country has problems with AIDS, crime, drug trafficking, etc. (CIA, **2010**). On January 12th, **2010**, an earthquake destroyed the capital of the country and worsened the overall situation of **Haiti**. The total loss was estimated around $11.5 billion; however, the country still needs more time to rebuild (U.S. Department of State, **2010**).  The majority of the donor countries worry about **Haiti** becoming a burden throughout **the years** without any positive results (Novacek et. al, **2008**). The country has both positive and negative sides. 

This business plan includes secondary data. Secondary data was selected from academic, government, news resources or based on extensive research by those with experience in dealing with **Haiti**. Considering retrieved data, the plan focused on the following aspects: 
  •  Past and current situations in **Haiti**; 
  •  A critical needs assessment of Southeastern area of **Haiti**;
  •  Our plan for investment in **Haiti**

After the detailed investigation of the authoritative sources and critically evaluating information, CEFOTAJ has concluded the following:
  •  **Haiti** has a potential for investment in the area of apparel/clothing.

  •  Establishment of our trade/learning school will facilitate and foster future investments within the country via job and economic growth in the southeastern area.

  •  Despite its economic situation, the country attracts foreign investments and investors. 

  •  Foreign investments and aid allow restoring the country quicker.

  •  Foreign investments positively affect the country.





Introduction


Background 

Investment into another country or internalization is a very important and scrupulous decision that a business has to make. As a rule, developing countries seek to attract investors in order to gain FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) and acquire technology. Mainly, the investors seek for variety of factors when going international. 

These factors include the following: 
  •  an area's business climate; education and training strengths; 
  •  labor unionization; attitudes of local and state governments; 
  •  available incentives;
  •  community attitude; 
  •  commuting distance; 
  •  transportation costs and  proximity to roads;
  •  availability of transportation facilities; 
  •  labor productivity and attitude toward productivity; 
  •  cost of labor; 
  •  availability of skilled and unskilled labor; 
  •  availability and transfer of qualified technicians and managers;
  •  land availability and cost; cost of construction; proximity and access to markets;
  •  availability and cost of utilities; 
  •  cost of living; 
  •  tax structures and rates; 
  •  insurance considerations; 
  •  financing opportunities; 
  •  banking services; 
  •  social and cultural climate; 
  •  quality of life; 
  •  local and physical infrastructure;
  •  proximity to suppliers/resources; 
  •  access to raw materials; CEO ownership preferences; 

**Haiti** (Republic of **Haiti**) is not a very easy place to invest. The country has a very unstable social and economic situation. It experienced a massive 7.0 earthquake and several subsequently large tremors, which led to the deaths of many citizens in **January **2010****. Currently, the country is experiencing problems with cholera, AIDS, high crime rates, high unemployment, and high illiteracy among other things.  According to CIA Factbook Report (**2010**), 80% of the population lives “under the poverty line and 54% in abject poverty”.
