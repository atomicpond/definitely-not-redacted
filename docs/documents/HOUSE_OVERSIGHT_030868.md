'He doesn't like this sh*t': **Trump** 
reportedly hates his job and his staff after 
less than a month

DON'T MISS STORIES. FOLLOW RAW STORY! 
After just three weeks on the job, President Donald **Trump** is reportedly frustrated with the realities of trying to 
run the U.S. government the way he manages his family-owned business. 
**Politico** interviewed nearly two dozen people who have spent time with the former real estate developer and 
reality TV star since his inauguration — and they said **Trump**'s "mood has careened between surprise and anger 
as he's faced the predictable realities of governing," according to the report. 
"The interviews paint a picture of a powder-keg of a workplace where job duties are unclear, morale among 
some is low, factionalism is rampant and exhaustion is running high," **Politico** reported. "Two visitors to the 
**White **HOUSE**** **last week** said they were struck by how tired the staff looks." 
**Trump** would like to shake up his **White **HOUSE**** staff less than a month into the job but knows it's too soon, the 
website reported, and aides joke that the president would like to spend even more time golfing at his Mar-A-
Lago resort. 
Sources close to **Trump** said he's infuriated by the profusion of leaks revealing his confrontational phone calls 
with world leaders and the herky-jerky inner workings of **the **White **HOUSE******. 
**the **White **HOUSE****** has launched an investigation of those leaks that appears to be focused on the National 
Security Council, based on the **Politico** report. 
**NSC** staffers have been instructed to cooperate with the inquiry, and the administration may tighten the inner 
circle of aides who have access to the calls and their transcripts, the website reported. 
A culture of fear and paranoia is developing, pitting the president and his allies against career **NSC** staff 
assigned from other agencies.

The **Trump** circle believe those career bureaucrats are out to get them, while **NSC** staffers are concerned the 
president isn't up to the job and resent the politicization of the agency by appointing Bannon to the council. 
Staffers fear **kushner** because he's so close to the president, and they aren't really sure of his official role in the 
**White **HOUSE****. 
For his part, **kushner** is furious at reports that **New Jersey** Gov. **Chris Christie** has been saying he will join the 
**White **HOUSE**** as part of a "second wave" after the president's son-in-law got him banished from the transition 
team as retribution for prosecuting his father. 
Sources said **Trump** often asks simple questions about his job, and he usually changes the subject when 
discussions become too detail-oriented to make it seem as if he's in control, said one senior government official. 
**Trump** prefers to hand off detailed questions to his son-in-law, **Jared **kushner****, or to chief strategist Steve 
Bannon or **HOUSE** Speaker **Paul Ryan**, the website reported. 
Those sources also revealed that **Trump** has privately expressed disbelief that judges, bureaucrats and 
lawmakers are able to halt him from filling government positions or implementing policies. 
"He doesn't like this sh*t," a source told **Politico**, referring to the difficulties **Trump** faced in getting one of his 
top fundraisers, Anthony Scaramucci, appointed to a job in the West Wing. 
However, sources said **Trump** appears to enjoy showing visitors around **The Oval Office**, where he spends most 
of his working hours, and keeping tabs on how his staffers look on TV news.
