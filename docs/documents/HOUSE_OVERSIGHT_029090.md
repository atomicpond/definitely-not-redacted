**Hey **Jeffrey****, 
Thought I'd check in and see what's up on your end. 
- I've been watching closely **Trump**'s appointees and there, he might be putting Balaji (a big 
bitcoiner) as **FDA** head, and Allison seems to be somewhat in favor of something like Bitcoin. And 
of course, Thiel has said that Bitcoin is what **PayPal** should have been... Curious to hear where 
your head is at on this matter. 
- **last week**, I presented my research at **Stanford**'s BPASE, it was well received. The most 
interesting thing I came up with for that is an inverse-input contract; i.e., funds that are "locked" to 
be spent only in the case where there are other funds that are not used in a specific way. An 
example of something that could be built with this: a matching donation contract, where you agree 
to donate your money to charity if someone else donates to charity, and you would not be able to 
release your funds from that agreement until they use their funds not for charity. 
- I'm in **Japan** **this week**, teaching a class to 100 Japanese Engineers to get the up to speed on 
bitcoin (with DG). It's very interesting to see the trepidation first hand that they have with respect to 
the technology, despite their debit-based society being more geared for it in any case (DG felt that 
even putting Bitcoin in the course name would scare away students). One of my friends (a hedge 
fund manager) told me that female japanese engineers are very good, and drastically under-
valued. I made sure to get a few invited to the class, we'll see if he's right. On the whole, it will be 
interesting to see the caliber of engineer **Japan** has to offer on this front. 
Best, 
Jeremy
