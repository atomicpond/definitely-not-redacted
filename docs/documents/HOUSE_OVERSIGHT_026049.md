I was in antarctica. The west antarctic ice sheet is melting at an unprecedented rate.. if it all goes into the ocean, 
sea levels will rise by about a meter. You are correct that we should ask if it can be reduced.. We are currently 
involved in a proposal that explores capturing CO2 from the atmosphere.. That may cost about 100/ton CO2.. if 
there was a carbon tax, that might be doable. it is not clear yet, but total research on this so far <10 
Million. Total research **each year** on oil and gas exploration >2 billion.

is the south pole getting colder and more ice ? is it accurate to say that climate changes can only be measured over long periods. 20 
years or more. I m here with the trump peopl in palm and when asked i say i dont have any idea if this global warming is a threat that 
can be reduced , currently, carbon taking machines. i guess if that is really a concern. i would also like to know what groups prefer 
warming. **Canada**?

yes, freeman dyson says that too.. That may be true at some level, and indeed during a period of the **Earth**'s history when there was 
more CO2 (hundreds of millions of years ago), there were very large plants of certain types... but what does this imply, really? more 
corn in the **Arctic**? do we need more corn in the **Arctic**? He has cherry picked data, the typical act of those who believe the answer 
before they ask the question.

My goodness. So you are listening to an old Nobel laureate whose expertise has nothing to do with this, who has never studied this
