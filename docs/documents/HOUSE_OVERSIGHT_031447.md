RE: **FBI** Request No 1203982-001/ **DOJ** OIP Appeal AP-2013-01397 (Jeffrey 
**Epstein**) 
Dear Ms. Pustay and Mr. O'Neill: 
On March 29, 2013, the OIP determined that the **FBI** could not rely on 5 U.S.C. § 
552(b)(7)(A) as a basis to withhold all records of past investigations regarding Mr. **Epstein**'s 
prior **FBI** **FOIA** request. On April 25, 2013, the **FBI** reopened the above-numbered **FOIA** 
request and stated that it had started its processing and searching for responsive records. On 
June 24, 2013, the **FBI** was informed that Mr. **Epstein** would pay the costs of copying. At 
present, 27 1/2 **months** after the **FBI** started to process Mr. **Epstein**'s **FOIA** request, Mr. **Epstein** 
has received just two "batches," the first numbering 372 pages (including redactions) that was 
produced on December 16, **2014**, and the second "batch" numbering 336 pages that was 
produced 5 1/2 **months** later on ******May** 29**, 2015**, out of a file that exceeds 12,000 pages. The 
processing of a third "batch" of documents will not begin until, at earliest, October, 2015, see 
infra. At this pace, the **FBI** will not complete the processing Mr. **Epstein**'s file until **2025**. A 
citizen should not have to wait **over a decade** for an agency to meet its **FOIA** obligations. As 
documented below — and within the **May** 1, 2015, and August 13, 2015, letters to Mr. Dennis 
Argall, **FBI** FOIPA Public Liaison Officer, each of which are attached — the **FBI** has declined to 
meet its statutory obligations in providing Freedom of Information Act mandated disclosures 
relating to the above-numbered request without unreasonable delay. Accordingly, I appeal to the 
01P to require the **FBI** to comply with its March 29, 2013, determination in a reasonably prompt 
manner. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 031447 
I spoke with Mr. Argall by telephone on August 12, 2015, and inquired as to when I 
could expect a third interim production. He informed me that the **FBI** reviewer assigned to the 
**Epstein** file had not commenced the processing of any additional materials in the 2 **months** 
following the ****May** 29** production and, further, that any such review was not currently scheduled 
and would not begin until, at earliest, **October 2015**. Given the lengthy delays due which 
include second level **FOIA** reviews conducted in Southern Florida by either the **USAO** or **FBI**, it 
predictably will take, at the very minimum, 5 1/2 **months** from the prior production in **May** until a 
third "batch" would be provided (not the 60-90 days I had repeatedly been told was the ordinary 
delay between separate 500 page productions on large files such as Mr. **Epstein**'s). At this pace 
— a production offewer than 500 pages out of the still unprocessed 11,000 pages each 5 1/2 
**months** — the remaining 22 "batches" will not be produced for ten more years. Mr. Argall also 
advised that the reviewer assigned to the request was processing other files and that, in essence, 
other than communicating with me (which Mr. Argall has done on a regular basis), he could not 
suggest a way to expedite the pace other than by my advising Mr. **Epstein** to relinquish his **FOIA** 
rights to the review of his entire file. 
The **FBI** response to the above-numbered **FOIA** request has been utterly incompatible 
with the language of the **FOIA**, which states that "[u]pon any determination by an agency to 
comply with a request for records, the records shall be made promptly available to such person 
making such request," 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(C)(i)(emphasis added), and with court opinions 
defining the **FOIA** "basic policy" as focusing on "citizens' right to be informed about 'what their 
government is up to," Dep't of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 
749, 773 (**1989**). Additionally, the **FBI**'s delays in this matter violate the policy of President 
Obama, announced on January 21, 2009, which directed each agency to "act promptly" and 
make "timely disclosures of information." Even further, the Attorney General in a Memorandum 
for the Heads of Executive Della'____tinents and Agencies dated March 19, 2009, stressed that **FOIA** 
"professionals should be mindful of their obligation to work 'in a spirit of cooperation' with 
**FOIA** requesters," that "unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles have no place in the 'new era of open 
Government,' and that "timely disclosure of information is an essential component of 
transparency [and] long delays should not be viewed as an inevitable and insurmountable 
consequence of high demand." (emphasis added). The pace of disclosure where Mr. **Epstein** has 
received less than 1,000 of over 12,000 pages in the over 28 **months** since the OIP required the
