J. or **Jeff** or **Jeffrey**, 
Hope things are going well for you. 
I finally finished trimming down my collection from 700 pages to 400, "60 Years of Investigative Satire: The 
Best of PK." The piece below is the last one in the book. You've previously seen the first half 
Enjoy, 
**Paul** or Zen Bastard or Rumpleforeskin 
Alternative Facts 
Between the choice of a one-man-one-vote (**Supreme Court** Justice Antonin Scalia) and fake news of Weapons 
of Mass Destruction, invasion of **Iraq**, and horror of **ISIS**, George **Bush** was elected president in **the year 2000**. It 
was due to **the electoral college** (a rigged system which originally intended to prevent slaves from voting and 
evolved to gerrymandering), even though **Bush**'s opponent, **Al Gore**, won the national popular vote. 
**Hillary Clinton** was elected senator **that year**, and she announced that the first thing she would do was to get rid 
of **the electoral college**. **A few years later**, as a columnist for **the New York Press**, I sent her a letter asking about 
the status of that promise. She didn't reply. 
On **November 8, 2016**, a crooked businessman, liar extraordinaire, bragging pussy-grabber, make-America-
white-again, anti-choice, anti-Semite, fake Christian, climate-change hoaxer, **Twitter** addict, homophobic, 
apprentice politician, friendly fascist, and Vladimir **Putin**'s "useful idiot," namely Donald **Trump**, who was 
elected as an insanely narcissistic dictator based on **the electoral college**, whereas his opponent, **Hillary Clinton**, 
won the national popular vote by "more than three million" individuals. 
Irony lives. 
But an incredibly cruel monster inadvertently awakened a sleeping population to counteract the essence of evil 
with love, laughs, and law, fueled by the aid of true news. Incidentally, **Putin** had 88 journalists murdered. No 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 030871 
wonder **Trump** told him, "It's an honor to be with you." Now **Putin** wanted new Obama's sanctions on **Russia** to 
be reprieved. 
National Security Adviser **Michael **flynn**** had discussed it with the Russian ambassador a month before **Trump** 
took office. Although General **flynn** joined his campaign and shared criminal secrets, he denied them to the **FBI**. 
It was a felony offense. **the Justice Department** warned **Trump** that **flynn** had misled **Mike Pence**, and that Flynt 
could be vulnerable to blackmail. **Trump** asked **flynn** to resign, and yet he offered his job back when he got out 
of prison. Why? Because Flynt was the scapegoat, taking the fall for the president and vice-president. He preferred 
a trial with immunity since they knew. Pence said Flynt lied and that itself was a lie. 
If **Trump** and Pence were both to be kicked out of **the White **HOUSE****, the next in line would be the Speaker of the 
**HOUSE**, ****Paul** **Ryan****. **Steve Bannon** has described him as "a limp-dick motherfucker who was born in a petri dish at 
**the **Heritage Foundation****." It takes one to know one. Indeed, Bannon said he wanted to destroy **Ryan**. 
Hallelujah!
