• **Trump** IMPEACHMENT PETITION: CLICK HERE TO SIGN THE PETITION 
WATCH: In a Shocking Turn of Events, **flynn** 
Moves To Take Down Pence. 
An **MSNBC** panel says that former **National Security** Advisor **Michael **flynn**** has information that could take down Vice 
President **Mike Pence**. **flynn** may have leaked information that shows Pence and the **Trump** transition team knew 
that foreign governments were paying him. 
If this information turns out to be true, it would be a devastating blow to the Vice President's reputation. So far, Pence is 
untouched by the **Russia** scandal. 
The prevailing opinion is that Pence didn't know anything about **flynn**'s calls to the Russian ambassador to the U.S. And 
the administration's story is that **flynn** lied about his Russian contacts to Pence.

ALERT: **HOUSE** Democrats Made The PERFECT Trap For Pence, and He Fell Right Into It. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 031740 
IT'S HAPPENING: **Trump** Insider TURNS On **Trump**, Asks For Plea Deal to Expose **Trump**. 
But these new leaks fly in the face of all this. They suggest that Pence knew about all of **flynn**'s dealingswith foreign 
governments and chose to ignore them. 
Additionally, Pence was the head of the **Trump** transition team and was supposed to vet all of **Trump**'s appointees. So he 
should have known about **flynn**'s work with **Turkey** and **Russia**. 
So either Pence is incompetent, or he's an outright liar. Neither is a good quality for a Vice President. 
**Washington Post** reporter Karen Tumulty also stated that Pence was in **The Oval Office** right before President **Trump** asked 
**Comey** to drop the **flynn** investigation. So Pence may also have been involved in **Trump**'s efforts to obstruct the 
investigation into **flynn** and the **Russia** scandal. 
**flynn** may not have finished with Pence, either. Bloomberg Politics editor John Heilemann showed how **flynn** can keep the 
pressure on Pence. 
Heilemann said, "Either he [Pence] knew and is lying or he did not know and was wildly incompetent. Either way, not a 
great story for him." 
"By the way, it seems to me the import of this story is that **Michael **flynn****'s lawyer came out a couple of months ago and 
said that **Mike **flynn**** had a story to tell," continued Heilemann. "He's now starting to tell that story." 
POLL: Is the whole **Trump** administration going down? 
The **Trump** administration claims that Vice President **Mike Pence** didn't know anything about **Michael **flynn****'s work with 
the Russian or Turkish governments. 
But **flynn** has allegedly released information contradicting these claims. 
Is **flynn** trying to take down the whole **Trump** administration? Share your opinion in the poll below. 
Heilemann suggested that **flynn** might be leaking these stories in 
order to get immunity. **flynn**'s hoping that he can prove his story is 
worth enough to gain immunity from prosecution. 
"If this is the thing that he's leaking, and there are other things that he's still holding to offer in exchange for immunity, that 
means this isn't even the worst of it___that means he's got more things to say," said Heilemann. 
If that's true, that means there's more bad news coming for Pence and **Trump**. **flynn** could help take down both men. 
It looking more and more like Pence is also guilty of treason. So **Congress** should impeach Pence as well as **Trump**. 
Unfortunately, that would put **HOUSE** Speaker **Paul Ryan** in charge. But at least he's not in the Russian President's pocket. 
**flynn**'s trying to get his revenge and take down the Vice President. Please share this story on **Facebook** to show that Pence 
isn't as innocent as we've been led to believe.
