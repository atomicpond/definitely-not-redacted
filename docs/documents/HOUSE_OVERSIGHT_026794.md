The world is moving rapidly from the model we have
lived within for 25 years. The where, why and what…
LONG TERM OUTLOOK:
- Geopolitical events are increasingly pressuring global markets and will continue to do
so for the remainder of 2015 and well into 2016.
- Middle East serves as locus for key uncertainty and chaos. We continue to believe the
region is at risk of remaining in turmoil for 30+ years .
- We continue to see NAFTA nations as being seen as economic and political “safe
havens” in large part to “Energy Renaissance.”
- China is going through intense political, economic and societal transformation – all of
which could potentially overwhelm the chances of a successful outcome.
SHORT TERM (3-10 month) OUTLOOK:
- In the coming three to six months, three key events will likely happen and have a long
term positive impact on markets:
‣ Approval and implementation of Iran nuclear negotiations
‣ Congressional approval of Trans-**Pacific Partnership** (TPP)
‣ US will approve repeal ban on export of crude oil/natural gas

The US: Washington’s 2015-2016 agenda - what to
expect and why it will be important
• Despite the contrary and dramatic press accounts,
Washington has been getting things done, a positive
for the political process and the nation. It may have
been messy but here is what they have gotten done
so far this year:
o Trade Promotion Authority (TPA)
o A federal budget
o Iran nuclear deal
o Debt ceiling
o Medicare Payment & CHIP funding
o **Homeland Security** funding
o Debt ceiling raise
But big policy items are unfinished:
o Appropriations (by December 11 th )
o Repealing oil export ban
o Highway bill
o Corporate Tax reform
o The Trans **Pacific Partnership** (TPP)

US corporate tax reform: have the seeds been
planted and is there a deal to be done?
- **the US Senate** has worked on a possible tax
package since January. But no clear consensus
has emerged on a larger package.
- The real focus is on corporate tax reform,
spurred on by the inversion debate.
- In the Senate, a bipartisan bill was offered to
encourage corporate profits abroad to repatriate
at a significantly lower rate (the Portman-
Schumer bill).
- In the House, a plan was offered in late July
that would allow corporations to repatriate at a
lower rate if they invested in “research and
development” (the Boustany-Neal bill). The
revenue from the deal would pay for the
Highway Trust Fund – which needs money.
- What is interesting for both bills is what did not
happen: **the White House** remained silent.
- Could Congress (in league with US Treasury)
slip a major corporate tax report into the
appropriations bill using the “Reconciliation”
process?

Should hedge funds and private equity funds be
worried about Washington? No.
- There continues to be chatter about dealing with carried interest. But chatter does not
mean action and we see little actual movement toward raising the rates on carried
interest through 2016.
- The new “tax reform” focused on hedge funds is projected to raise $11 billion a year.
Somehow this gets done by allowing the IRS to audit hedge funds and find this amount
of unreported revenue annually. Good luck with that.
- Private Equity has also been a focus of political chatter – maybe we see new regulation
on the burgeoning “Shadow Banking” sector? Again, chatter is not action. There is little
chance Congress or regulators will move aggressively in this space through 2016.
- But “Big Banks” continue to take it on the chin: In an effort to raise revenue for the
Highway Trust Fund, Republicans have legislation moving forward that would drop the
guaranteed interest rate banks receive for “investing” in **the ****Federal Reserve****** – which
they are required to do by law - from 6 percent to 1.5 percent. This will result in a
significant drop in revenues for some of the biggest banks in the US.
