I think scholarly but not too much so. no one above the law.. we began leaving a kingdom. . unlikely to 
give king like powers to a president. on one above the law. I would like lunch pail joe to come away and 
think, this guy is smart . I understood. lets see what he writes about the **Clintons**. 
someone suggested that trump could shoot someone on fifth avenue and not lose a vote, that is true , but 
would make little sense for him not to suffer an immediate consequence. the allowed civil depo setting 
precedent for criminal process , is a lawyers outline I might think of dumbing it down, again, and suggesting 
that you can sue your neighbor, even if you neighbor is the president. makes little sense that the you can be 
indicted for assaulting him but he cannot if he assaults you. low bar for civil higher bar for criminal. . at 
some point on your book tour I might point out how disappointed you were that the **CLINTON** and betty curries' 
trashcan story, was reopened. .

Good morning! 
Jed teaches crim law at **Yale**. Outspokenly strong on the need for procedural fairness in campus adjudicatory 
proceedings. Relevant to your friend's unhappy situation? If so, happy to make the connection. 
Hugs, ****Ken**
