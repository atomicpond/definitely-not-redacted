Commission on Accreditation of Ambulance Services (CAAS)
Any ambulance service can claim it is delivering quality service, but an accredited agency can
prove it through its written or documented procedures systems and reports. **TCMIH** demonstrates
full compliance with national ambulance standards of excellence to meet and maintain CAAS.
**TCMIH** will also maintain Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Blood
Borne Pathogen (BBP), Vehicle Safety (EMD & CEVO), ****Virgin Islands**** Traffic Laws and VI Code
Tax Laws.
CAAS was established in **1990** as a not-for-profit national agency to uphold quality operating
standards for ambulance services. It is the gold standard for the ambulance industry, in as much as
JCAHO (Joint Commission of Accreditation of **Healthcare** Organizations) is the benchmark for
hospital excellence.
The accreditation process entails a serious self-assessment, comparing us to the accreditation
standards. We work through a comprehensive application process with guidance, consultation and
mentorship from our CEO; Mr. Jeffery Gilliard former Director of Coastal Ambulance, Brevard
County **Florida**.
Within **two years** TCIMH
