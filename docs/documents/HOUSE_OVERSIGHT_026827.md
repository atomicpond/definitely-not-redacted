Terrorism - Metrojet and **Paris** Mark Externalization of **ISIS** Threat 
It has been a consensus view in the US and **Europe** that the dangers posed by **ISIS** included metastasizing into other 
**Middle Eastern** and African countries -- something that **Turkey** has already experienced and ****Saudi Arabia**** and others 
likely face. **Europe** was believed to be at less risk, although as the flow of refugees from **Syria**, **Iraq**, and **Afghanistan** 
increased, that risk has risen. 
The US and everywhere else were thought to be tertiary targets, subject to opportunistic attacks but 
almost a distraction to **ISIS** (cf. **Al Qaeda**), given its preoccupation with exploitation of Sunni/Shia 
divisions and goal of regional territorial gains. Remember, **ISIS**' military leadership largely is drawn from 
Sunnis who were a part of **Saddam**'s military; they are motivated by revenge for how they have been treated by the 
Shia-dominated post- **Saddam** Iraqi government.) 
Last week's Metrojet bombing in **Egypt**, the suicide attacks **Thursday** in a Shiite neighborhood of 
**Beirut**, and **yesterday** atrocities in **Paris** all demonstrate an unexpected level of sophistication and 
effort. As a result, European countries and the US are likely to see an increase in incidents and threats that harken 
back to **Al Qaeda**'s early agenda or are comparable to the Black September and early Hezbollah attacks of the '70s. 
What are the consequences? 
• **ISIS** can be expected to undertake further spectacular attacks. It has eclipsed AQ in operational capability, 
financing, and recruitment. It is not only the wealthiest terror group in history, but one with global reach 
and ambitions. (The Obama Administration's claims that **ISIS** is contained now look naive, and that 
characterization will haunt **President Obama** and Democrats **next year**.) 
• Expect a significant uptick in **Eli**, US, and Russian engagement against **ISIS** in the **Iraq**/**Syria** theater, but 
also in **Europe**. The failure to detect this elaborate scheme (no less complex because it was "low tech" -- so 
was 9/11) will prompt European security and intelligence agencies to take a much more intrusive and 
perhaps even confrontational approach both to indigenous Muslim groups and to arriving refugees. While 
that risks a feed-back loop, the instinct will be to err on the side of immediate results, not impact on 
radicalization as a social challenge. 
• Germany and other **Eli** nations will have to re-examine their commitments to welcome more refugees from 
**the **Middle East****, and British opposition to allowing refugees, already strong, will harden. The scale of the 
**Paris** attacks will energize right-wing politics and pressure center-left governments to make threat reduction 
a higher priority than humanitarian concerns.

• The universal horror at what happened in **Paris** is likely to strengthen the determination of countries 
gathered in **Vienna** for the **Syria** conference to better coordinate and prosecute the campaign against **ISIS** in 
**Syria** and Ira. 
Bottom Line: Has risk to **the United States** increased? There are no indications yet that **ISIS** has changed its 
approach here. It encourages radicalization and lone wolf attacks but has not mounted direct attacks. But the 
Metrojet bombing has resulted in a stepped up global effort to secure American airlines. So too, targeting of 
American institutions/events — it is unlikely a coincidence that an American band was playing at the site of the largest 
causalities in **Paris** -- seems highly probable. This applies equally to American bases and facilities overseas, including 
embassies.
