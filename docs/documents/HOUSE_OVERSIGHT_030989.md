A new book claims **Jeffrey **Epstein**** played a key role in a shady **Palm Beach** real estate deal between President 
Donald **Trump** and a Russian oligarch. 
Michael **Wolff**'s forthcoming book, "Siege," details the **2004** property deal that involved the future president, 
**Deutsche Bank**, a child predator and an ally of Russian president **Vladimir **Putin****, reported The **Guardian**.

ADVERTISING 
According to **Wolff**'s account, **Epstein** showed his friend **Trump** a $55 million mansion he planned to buy, but 
**Trump** instead went behind his back to buy the foreclosed property for about $40 million. 
**Epstein** didn't believe **Trump** could raise that much money on his own, through an entity called **Trump** 
Properties LLC that was entirely financed by **Deutsche Bank**, **Wolff** wrote. 
The billionaire financier knew **Trump** had been loaning out his name in real estate deals for a fee, and he 
suspected the freshly minted reality TV star was fronting for the mansion's real owners. 
74-.PUP. 
**Epstein** threatened to expose the deal until he found himself under investigation by **Palm Beach** police for child 
sex abuse and human trafficking, and he eventually served **13 months** in county jail as part of a controversial 
plea agreement brokered by **Trump**'s future **Labor** Secretary **Alex Acosta**. 
**Trump** later put the mansion on the market for $125 million, despite making only minor improvements to the 
property. 
It was purchased for $96 million by **Dmitry Rybolovlev**, a **Kremlin**-linked industrialist — which meant **Trump** 
made $55 million on the deal despite risking none of his own money. 
**Wolff** offers two possible theories for the deal. 
The author suspects that **Trump** may have earned a fee for hiding a shadow owner who possibly was funneled 
cash by Rybolovlev for reasons beyond the property's value. 
Or, **Wolff** theorizes, Rybolovlev essentially bought the **HOUSE** from himself, with **Trump** as an intermediary, to 
launder ill-gotten money. 
"This," **Wolff** wrote, "was **Donald **Trump**'s** world of real estate." 
Rybolovlev tore down the mansion in **2016** and sold off the property as three lots for less than the $115 million 
he had invested in it.
