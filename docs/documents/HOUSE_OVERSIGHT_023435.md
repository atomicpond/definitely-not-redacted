﻿PROPOSAL: **Poetry** in America for Middle and High School Teachers
A. NATURE OF THE REQUEST
**Poetry** in America, a collaboration between **Elisa New** and Programs in Professional
Education (PPE) at **the **Harvard** Graduate School of Education** (HGSE), will produce courses
for national and international distribution to K­12 teachers. Drawing on **Elisa New**’s extensive
archive of raw instructional video, HGSE has the goal of providing online graduate­level
professional development courses for teachers who have never before had the opportunity to
advance their careers online. Teachers will be able to use to this course to strengthen their
classroom practice while accumulating credits toward advanced degrees in education.
Though American teachers are required to take professional development courses, very few
of these courses offer teachers content support. This initiative will provide such support at a
high level, offering **Harvard** credits and career advancement to participating teachers.
Additionally, this initiative will produce classroom­ready video content designed to engage and
educate middle and high school students, thus enabling teachers to bring the content of their
professional development directly into the classroom. It will give teachers the confidence and
tools to discuss **Poetry** while also meeting **English Language Arts** standards and providing
teachers with professional development opportunities. The first such course, **Poetry** of the
City, is already in active development, with its first one­credit module, on the **Poetry** of Walt
Whitman, currently entering the post­production stage. The second proposed course (either
“The **Poetry** of Character Development and the Feelings” ­­concerned with building literacy
skills and character awareness­­ or “The **Poetry** of Earth, Sea, and Sky” ­­concerned with
making connections between science and **Poetry**) will enter post­production as soon as funds
become available.
In addition to the production team (including an executive director, video editor, media
manager, and instructional designer), we are joined by a diverse set of senior partners
including:
● James Ryan, Dean of **the **Harvard** Graduate School of Education**
● Mary Grassa O’Neill, Managing Director of HGSE Professional Education and former
superintendent of the Archdiocese of Boston and Milton Public Schools
● Roland Fryer, Henry Lee Professor of Economics at **Harvard**, Macarthur “Genius,”
and founder of the Education Innovation Laboratory
● Robert Polito, American academic, critic, poet, and President of The **Poetry**
Foundation.
Our advisory board includes:
● US Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky
● Actor **John Lithgow**
● Hip­Hop Artist Nas
● distinguished academics and poets from **Harvard** and elsewhere
Participants and Filmed Conversations include:
● President Bill Clinton, **Herbie Hancock**, poet Sonia Sanchez, and children from the
**Harlem** Children’s Zone on disappointment and discrimination (filmed in **Harlem** and
LA)
● Nas on traditions of American urban long­form **Poetry**
● **Lena Dunham** on truth­telling and romantic love (filmed in **Brooklyn**)
● Woody Allen on **Poetry**, sincerity, and morality
● **Supreme Court** Justice **elena kagan** on **Poetry** and the law
● **Vice President Al** Gore on **Poetry** and the environment
● **Robert Frost** biographer Jay Parini with **Harvard** students on trauma (filmed in
**Vermont**)
● **Alfre Woodard** on Gwendolyn Brooks and rebellion
● Senator John McCain on love and loyalty to comrades (filmed in **Washington DC**)
● Katie Couric on grief and self­control
● **NBA** athletes Shane Battier and Jason Collins on form and basketball
B. PROJECT ACTIVITIES
The activities of this proposal fall into three major categories: production, post­production, and
distribution. The activities involve collaboration between academics, professional course
developers, curricular designers and video producers.
**Poetry** in America has amassed well over one hundred hours of high quality instructional
video, including dozens of interpretive conversations with well­known personalities across the
professions. Some additional production is expected, and a crew is now assembled to
accomplish additional production in a cost effective manner. The post­production stage will
involve discussion and planning with **the **Harvard** Graduate School of Education** and other
educational and media partners based on this current sizeable archive of raw video footage.
At the post­production stage, we will shape and edit the raw footage into curricular content for
teachers, and produce classroom­ready video. The post­production team, led by an
experienced course developer and producer, will also include a professional
videographer/editor with experience in creating high­quality pedagogy, a media manager, and
a curriculum design team comprised of an instructional designer and IT specialist. HGSE will
develop graduate course materials, including classroom­usable lesson plans, based on video
content. Courses offered will include uncoached, lightly coached and fully coached versions of
teaching **Poetry** in
