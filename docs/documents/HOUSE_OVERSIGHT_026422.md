Didn't know. Meaning of the rest note? 
**Mahler**'s 5th opens with the same rhythmic motif (but 4th note is the same as the first three, not lower as in 
**Beethoven**'s) - **Mahler**'s 5th is my favorite symphony.

for me it is tied to music. beethovens fifth, is 555-3 . though unbeknownst to most people the first 
note ( you can verify, bu looking at the score ) , is a rest note ( silent ) so 0-555-3
