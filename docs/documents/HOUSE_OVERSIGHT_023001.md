HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023001 
Jeffrey Epstein is flanked by his legal team during a court hearing in the summer of 
2008. Uma Sanghvi **Palm Beach** Post via AP 
For years, Jeffrey Epstein abused teen girls, police say. A 
timeline of his case 
PERVERSION 
ofJUSTIC 
**a decade** before #MeToo, a multimillionaire sex offender from Florida got the 
ultimate break. 
2005 
March: A **14-year-old** girl and her parents report that Jeffrey Epstein molested her 
at a mansion in **Palm Beach**. She said a female acquaintance and classmate at Royal 
**Palm Beach** **High School** had taken her to the house to give him a massage in 
exchange for money. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023002 
Jeffrey Epstein repeatedly engaged in sexual activity with underage girls at his 
waterfront **Palm Beach** home on ****El Brillo** Way**, according to police in the Town of 
**Palm Beach**. Epstein also owns residences in **New York City** and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, among other locales. **Emily Michot** emichotPmiamiherald.com  
April: **Palm Beach** police begin trash pulls at Epstein's home, discovering a 
telephone message for Epstein with the girl's name on it, and a time that matched 
the time that she told police she was there. They find the names and phone numbers 
of other girls on message slips in his trash. 
October: With the police probe in full swing, one of Epstein's assistants calls one of 
the girls just as she is being questioned by police. Investigators begin interviewing 
more girls, as well as Epstein's butlers, who tell them that Epstein had frequent 
visits from girls throughout the day. On Oct. 20, they execute a search warrant at his 
house on ****El Brillo** Way** in **Palm Beach**. 
2006 
May: Police sign a probable cause affidavit charging Epstein and two of his 
assistants with multiple counts of unlawful sex acts with a minor. The **Palm Beach** 
state attorney, **Barry Krischer**, instead refers the case to a grand jury. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023003 
Town of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023004 
**Palm Beach** police were unhappy with the handling of the Epstein case by then-State 
Attorney **Barry Krischer**. 
June: The grand jury, after hearing from only one girl, returns an indictment of one 
count of solicitation of prostitution. The charge does not reflect that the victim in 
question and others were minors. 
July: Epstein's powerhouse legal team tries to negotiate a deal with the State 
Attorney's Office. Lawyers discuss a deferred prosecution in which Epstein would 
enter a pretrial intervention program and serve no jail time. 
July: After pressure from the **Palm Beach** police chief, the FBI opens a federal 
investigation, dubbed "Operation Leap Year." Documents list the possible crime as 
"child prostitution." 
**November**: The FBI begins interviewing potential witnesses and victims from 
Florida, New York and ****New Mexico****. 
2007 
May: As the U.S. Attorney's Office prepares to present the case to a federal grand 
jury, Epstein's attorneys request a meeting to discuss the investigation. 
June: A 53-page indictment is prepared by the U.S. Attorney's Office as, 
simultaneously, plea negotiations are initiated with Epstein's legal team. 
July: Grand jury subpoenas are issued for Epstein's computers, which were 
apparently removed from his **Palm Beach** home prior to the police search. 
August: The U.S. attorney in Miami, Alexander Acosta, enters into direct 
discussions about the plea agreement; a motion to compel production of Epstein's 
computers is delayed. 
**September**: Federal prosecutors draw up several federal plea agreements that are 
rejected by Epstein and his attorneys. Epstein signs a non-prosecution agreement 
on Sept. 24, but his attorneys continue to delay his court appearance. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023005 
Alexander Acosta has been criticized for his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case as 
U.S. attorney. He later became the dean of Florida International University's law 
school and, later still, **President Trump**'s secretary of labor. ******Miami Herald****** file photo 
October: With the non-prosecution agreement still being debated, Acosta meets 
with Epstein lawyer **Jay Lefkowitz** at the **West **Palm Beach**** **Marriott** on Okeechobee 
Road to discuss finalizing a dea
