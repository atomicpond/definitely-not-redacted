Saudi trade continues to gain momentum as we head into ****March** 28** FTSE decision, followed by MSCI in June. 
Our base case is for a positive outcome for both EM index reviews. 
• Tadawul +5% past 3 sessions printing new 3 year highs, Foreign inflows YTD at $1.35bn 
• Recent headline on Aramco: Saudi Aramco likely to be delayed to 2019. Delay not all together surprising giving complexity of the transaction, delays in choosing 
the trading venues, as well as to better align the IPO with potential MSCI / FTSE index inflow timelines 
• Crown Prince MBS will appear on '60 Minutes' on **March** 18th, **one day** before he lands in the US for a **10 day** tour, meeting Trump on the 20th. 
• Reform agenda picking up speed: Women Driving; Entertainment/Movie Theaters; Welfare Programs; Market access reforms & Intl debt issues 
Saudi Fundamentals are strong (see Jean-Michel Saliba's report from Jan. 29th below): 
• Growth has bottomed out 
• OPEC is succeeding at rebalancing the oil market. Fiscal adjustment now sufficient to safeguard stability at cUS$60/bbl. 
• Equity strategy: remain positive, outlook gains momentum - We retain our positive view on the Saudi market as we see strong earnings 
momentum as well as increasing appetite for Saudi equities amongst global investors: 
Best way to access the trade: IX/MAP (MSCI Saudi Provisional Index) 
• 32-name MSCI-owned index, that will rebalance into the full **MSCI EM** index upon inclusion 
• Trades $90m/ day based on bottleneck liquidity 
• Tradable on swap at lmL+90bps, std comm applies; also accessible on fully funded **Luxembourg**-listed warrant (MERRI1DT LX) 
10 single stock names to own in Saudi 
• Al Rajhi: BAML Top pick for 2018 » Largest bank in Saudi » Reflation trade beneficiary » We see the bank continuing to deliver strong earnings momentum on 
the back of: (1) Stand out NIM expansion given a unique cost of funding position and further policy rate hikes (2) a continued normalization in asset quality 
driving CoR lower; (3) Higher loan growth than peers as it benefits from consumer loan growth (particularly housing) whilst taking share in the corporate market and 
(4) Al Rajhi is set to be a key beneficiary from the potential forthcoming Saudi index inclusions. 
• NCB: We see NCB as a key beneficiary from the economic diversification program the **Government** has introduced. Its large balance sheet and resulting ability to 
finance mega projects should allow it to capture market share in **the coming years**. Further support will come from having the PIF as a major shareholder. We also see 
a sublime margin outlook given NCB's ability to benefit from rising interest rates and bond yields. 
• SABIC: Expect strong earnings momentum in FY18E driven by robust product prices as well as solid plant operations. View company's intent to expand 
internationally as a catalyst for unlocking balance sheet value. The company is expected to be the largest constituent of Saudi **MSCI EM** Index (-16%). Shares trade at a 
2018E EV/EBITDA of 7.4x, —20% discount vs global peers. 
• Yansab: Given robust MEG pricing outlook (40% of profits, prices up 18% YTD) providing a healthy tailwind to earnings **this year**, we expect an attractive dividend 
yield of 6% (top quartile globally) in FY18E/19E well supported by FCF yields of 9% and a net cash position. 
• SIC: One of the main beneficiaries of index inflows into Saudi. STC has finally improved management representation to investors with the departure of the 
previous IR, and new team in place. Significant **Government** receivables recovery to drive stock price for next two quarters, while Careem stake can provide some 
positive headline risk on valuations.

• Jarir: We like Jarir for its potential to increase its market penetration having increased its store count by 13% since **August 2017** while maintaining its premium 
ROE of 53% and attractive dividend. 
• Al Tayyar : Stock will see a slew of positive catalysts over the next two quarters, particularly a second tranche of substantial gov receivable recoveries in Ql. 
130mn SAR loss from associates in 2017 is a one off and should make comps
