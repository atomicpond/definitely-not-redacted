Alternative Asset Managers
Can Alts Unlock Value with
C-Corp Conversions?
We think APO could unlock the most value by converting to a C-corp with 26%
in our upside case vs. -14% in our downside case. ARES could be the first to
convert, but this is largely priced in. These firms have more sticky management
fee-related earnings vs. BX/CG/KKR that may see less benefit.
**Morgan Stanley** does and seeks to do business with companies covered in **Morgan Stanley** Research. As a result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a conflict of
interest that could affect the objectivity of **Morgan Stanley** Research. Investors should consider **Morgan Stanley** Research as only a single factor in making their investment decision.

Alternative Asset Managers
Can Alts Unlock Value with
C-Corp Conversions?
We think APO could unlock the most value by converting to a C-corp
with 26% in our upside case vs. -14% in our downside case. ARES
could be the first to convert, but this is largely priced in. These
firms have more sticky management fee-related earnings
vs. BX/CG/KKR that may see less benefit.
We believe ARES could be the first Alt stock to convert; we
would view that as a positive catalyst for the group that, if successful,
could lead others to follow. ARES reports 4Q earnings on
February 15, and we expect a potential announcement or indications
of mgmt's intentions and/or timing. C-corp conversion has dominated
our conversations with investors of late with increased
inbound questions including interest from some new to the Alts. As
a result, in this report we expand on prior work here, and here, creating
a C-corp conversion scorecard with qualitative pros/cons for
each company. We also evaluate the potential valuation impact if
Alts convert, and we take a deep dive into how the market might
value two earnings components in a C-corp structure: 1) sticky, recurring
management fee-related earnings and 2) performance fees.
We see an opportunity for Alts to unlock value by shedding the
partnership structure and converting to C-corps. Changing from
a partnership structure could help alleviate the complexities of current
K-1 tax reporting and expand the universe of eligible investors in
the Alts. Some investors today are restricted from investing in limited
partnerships, while others don't want the operational and tax
complexities of investing in a partnership structure.
Management fee-related earnings could re-rate higher toward
22.5x in our upside case, as we look at three different approaches
for valuing this sticky earnings stream: 1) traditional asset manager
comps vs. organic growth, 2) publicly traded C-corp Alts comps,
and 3) an approach looking at FRE as bond yield proxy with a credit
spread, to determinate an appropriate cap rate.
Performance fees appear cheap (at 6.1x) if management fees
re-rate to 22.5x in the context of Alts converting to C-corps and a
24% overall tax rate. This suggests the market is misvaluing performance
fees, and we could also see Alts performance fee earnings
re-rate higher if C-corp conversion expanded the investor base.
We see companies that have a greater skew to management fees
as best positioned for conversion, as we see the greatest potential
for multiple expansion on for this portion of the earnings. For stocks
under coverage, we see APO as potentially being able to unlock
the most value, with near-term upside to current prices of 26%,
