Honorable **Mark Filip** 
**Office** of the Deputy Attorney General 
**United States Department of Justice** 
**950 **Pennsylvania Avenue****, N.W. 
**Washington**, D.C. 20530 
**Dear Judge Filip**: 
This letter briefly supplements our prior submission to you dated **May 19, 2008**. In that 
communication, we urgently requested that your **Office** conduct an independent review of the 
proposed federal prosecution of our client, Jeffrey Epstein. The dual reasons for our request that 
you review this matter are (i) the bedrock need for integrity in the enforcement of federal 
criminal laws, and (ii) the profound questions raised by the unprecedented extension of federal 
law by **the United States** Attorney's **Office** in **Miami** (the "**USAO**") to a prominent public figure 
who has close ties to former President Clinton. 
The need for review is now all the more exigent. On Monday, **May 19, 2008**, First 
Assistant **Jeffrey Sloman** of the **USAO** responded to an email from **Jay Lefkowitz** informing U.S. 
Attorney **Alex Acosta** that we would be seeking your **Office**'s review. Mr. Sloman's letter, 
which imposed a deadline of **June 2, 2008** to comply with all the terms of the current Non-
Prosecution Agreement (the "Agreement"), plus new unilateral modifications, on pain of being 
deemed in breach of that Agreement, appears to have been deliberately designed to deprive us of 
an adequate opportunity to seek your **Office**'s review in this matter. 
The **USAO**'s desire to foreclose a complete review is understandable, given that the 
Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section ("**CEOS**") has already determined that our substantive 
arguments regarding why a federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein is not warranted were 
"compelling." However, in contradiction to Mr. Sloman's assertion that **CEOS** had provided an 
independent, de novo review, **CEOS** made clear that it did not do so. Indeed, **CEOS** declined to 
examine several of the more troubling aspects of the investigation of Mr. Epstein, including the 
deliberate leak to **the New York Times** of numerous highly confidential aspects of the 
investigation and negotiations between the parties as well as the recent crop of civil lawsuits 
filed against Mr. Epstein by Mr. Sloman's former law partner. 
The unnecessary and arbitrarily imposed deadline set by the **USAO** was done without any 
respect for the normal functioning and scheduling of **State** judicial matters. It requires that 
Mr. Epstein's counsel persuade the **State** Attorney of **Palm Beach** to issue a criminal information

to a charge that the **State** Attorney has not, despite a two year investigation, determined to be 
appropriate. Mr. Epstein's counsel must also successfully expedite a plea of guilty to this charge 
on a date prior to July 8, 2008, which is the date presently set by the **State** court Judge. 
Further, the unnecessary deadline is even more problematic because Mr. Epstein's effort 
to reconcile the **State** charge and sentence with the terms of the Agreement requires an unusual 
and unprecedented threatened application of federal law. Thus, it places Mr. Epstein in the 
highly unusual position of having to demand that the **State** acquiesce to a more severe 
punishment than it had already determined was appropriate. 
We have attempted to resolve these and other issues through the **USA**() and **CEOS**, 
including raising our concerns about the **USAO**'s inappropriate conduct with respect to this 
matter. But those avenues have now been shut down. Mr. Sloman's letter purports to prohibit 
any further contact between Mr. Epstein's defense team and U.S. Attorney Acosta, and instead 
requires us to communicate with the **USA**() only though Mr. Sloman's subordinates. 
While it pains us to say this, this misguided prosecution from the outset gives the 
appearance that it may have been politically motivated. Mr. Epstein is a highly successful, self-
made businessman and philanthropist who entered the public arena only by virtue of his close 
personal association with former President Bill Clinton. There is little doubt in our minds that 
the **USA**() never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case if Mr. Epstein were just 
another "John." 
U.S. Attorney Acosta previously has stated that he is "sympathetic" to our federalism-
related concerns, but he has taken the position that his authority is limited by enforcement 
policies set forth in **Washington**, D.C. As expressed in our prior communication to you, we 
believe that a complete and independent appraisal and resolution of this case most appropriately 
would be undertaken by your **Office**—beginning with the rescission of the arbitrary, unfair, and 
unprecedented deadline that Mr. Sloman demands to have imposed in this case. At the very 
least, we would app
