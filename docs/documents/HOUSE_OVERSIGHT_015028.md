Jeffrey Epstein, the wealthy **Palm Beach** resident charged with having teenage girls give him sexual massages, pleaded guilty to
prostitution solicitation charges in ****Palm Beach** County** **Circuit Court** on June 20, **2008**. (Uma Sanghvi / **The **Palm Beach** Post**)
Posted: 8:00 a.m. Saturday, August 26, 2017
**West **Palm Beach**** — Nearly 10 years after billionaire Jeffrey Epstein signed a plea deal that let him
escape federal prosecution on charges of sexually abusing dozens of teenage girls at his **Palm Beach**
mansion, the 64-year-old politically-connected money manager faces the possibility that the agreement
could be thrown out.
In court papers filed **this month**, attorneys representing two of the 30 young women prosecutors say
Epstein molested lodged their final written pleas aimed at spurring U.S. **District Judge Kenneth** Marra
to force federal officials to reopen their investigation into the sordid case.
U.S. government lawyers in **September** will have
another chance to defend themselves against allegations that they violated the federal **Crime Victims**’
**Rights Act** by failing to alert Epstein’s victims of the terms of what some describe as a “sweetheart
deal.” Marra could make a decision as early as **this fall**.
The stakes for all **Crime Victims** are high, said attorneys **Bradley Edwards** and **Paul **Cassell****, who filed
the rare lawsuit against the federal government on behalf of two **Jane Does** who were 13 and 14 when
they claim Epstein paid them for sex.
If Marra dismisses the lawsuit, “then the government will never have to give any information in any

case to any victim,” they wrote, urging him to uphold the provisions of the **13-year-old** federal law.
At the same time, the stakes are equally high for Epstein, who has ferried President Bill Clinton on his
private jet and counts celebrities, such as **Britain**’s Prince Andrew, as friends.
Marra has already ruled that if he finds that federal prosecutors violated the act, he will consider
throwing out the plea deal that Epstein signed with federal prosecutors in **2007**. **Miami** attorney Roy
Black, one of dozens of high-profile lawyers who has represented Epstein, claims that would be
manifestly unfair.
As part of the unusual non-prosecution agreement, which wasn’t shared with victims for **nearly a year**
while and after it was being negotiated, federal prosecutors agreed not to pursue charges that could
have sent Epstein to prison for life. In exchange, Epstein in **2008** pleaded guilty in ****Palm Beach** County**
**Circuit Court** to two **Florida** criminal charges — one count each of soliciting a minor for prostitution and
soliciting prostitution. He served **13 months** of an **18-month** sentence in a vacant wing of the county
stockade — a cell he was allowed to leave 16 hours a day, **six days** a week.
Epstein, who now spends most of his time on his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, also is
required to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life. In addition, as part of the plea deal, he paid
roughly 30 women, who were identified by prosecutors as his victims, undisclosed amounts of money
to settle civil lawsuits they had filed against him.
To throw out the deal after Epstein has been punished would rob him of his constitutional right to due
process, Black wrote in court papers. “If a defendant lives up to his end of the bargain, the government
is bound to perform its promises,” he wrote, quoting a prior court decision.
However, Edwards and **Cassell** claim that because federal prosecutors didn’t confer with their clients
about the plea deal before it was made, they violated the law and that makes the non-prosecution
agreement illegal. They cited examples where plea deals have been invalidated after judges later
found prosecutors violated the **Crime Victims**’ rights law.
In most of the cases they cited, the mistakes were the result of oversights. But Edward and **Cassell**
wrote, “The undisputed facts of this case prove that, rather than forthrightly discharging its obligations
to numerous child sexual assault victims, the government chose to enter into a secret deal with the
man who had victimized them.”
Federal prosecutors have said they didn’t reveal the terms of the non-prosecution agreement because
they feared Epstein and his high-powered attorneys were trying to circumvent it. Still, Edwards and
**Cassell**, said there was no justification for the secrecy.
“The government’s conduct here was particularly egregious, because it repeatedly found time to confer
with attorneys for Epstein — the man who sexually abused the victims,” they said of emails and
meetings between federal prosecutors, includi
