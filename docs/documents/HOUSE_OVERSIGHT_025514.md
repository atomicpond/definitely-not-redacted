Subject: Re: poetry and science 
Importance: High 
okay. you let me know when you can talk. 
And I hadn't added to this list neuroscience--where Emily Dickinson has it nailed-- and maybe this would be the 
right poem for your group. Notice how many metaphors are operating simultaneously here 
The Brain, within its Groove 
Runs evenly--and true--
But let a Splinter swerve--
'Twere easier for You--
To put a Current back--
When Floods have slit the Hills--
And scooped a Turnpike for Themselves--
And trodden out the Mills--
I get to New York **Thursday** am or perhaps **tomorrow** night...haven't decided quite yet which. Always 
prefer face to face if you have time

Apropos of our conversation of a few minutes ago, This proposal went to someone I thought was 
interested in the environment and science but who seems, in fact, far more interested in supporting TV 
on a broad range of topics. 
500,000 would fund this initiative as the second HGSE course (after Poetry of the City) and could begin 
immediately, Jan 1.. I'd be thrilled to include other scientists you name, perhaps taping the group in a 
session on metaphor at the edges of fields. 
INote that taped sessions already include economics, marine biology, astronomy, evolutionary biology, 
zoology, physics and computer science. Richard Dawkins, Walter Isaacson, David Mossberg and David
