T
he identity of the woman, who
filed a series **DONALD** **Trump** rape
cases, has been revealed. It turned
out it was the same woman behind the
different cases filed in different courts
one after the other.
In a May 6 report from showbiz
website Gossip Extra, the woman
behind the rape case against the
presidential-wannabe **DONALD**
**Trump**, along with the American
financier **Jeffrey **Epstein****, was
identified as Katie **Johnson**. In the
same report, some highlights were
revealed, including the defendant
and circumstances revolving the
case.
It was also in the same report where
the man who claimed as the
spokesperson for **Johnson** said that
the plaintiff has been shopping for
lawyers from **California**, **Atlanta**,
and **Florida** to represent her when
they re-file the **DONALD** **Trump** rape
case in **New York**. The case, which
was initially filed in **California** in
**April**, was junked by the court after
failure of the complainant to prove a
**California** address.
True enough, a rape case filed
against the same respondents,
**Trump** and **Epstein**, with basically
the same facts, reappeared and was
refilled in ****New York** City**, like what
**Johnson**’s spokesperson said last
month.

However, in the newly filed case in
****New York** City**, the respondent was
only identified as **Tiffany Doe**. In the
case in ****New York** City**, the
complainant claimed she was raped
by **Trump** and **Epstein** in one of the
parties **Epstein** hosted, the Real Deal
reported.
She claimed that she was only 13
when she was raped by the duo in
**1994**. The incident occurred at
**Epstein**’s Wexner Mansion. In the
document, the complainant added
she was hired by **Epstein** to recruit
young girls in the guise of a
modeling stint. **Trump**’s camp
refused to comment as they are yet
to read the complaint, while
**Epstein**’s representatives were not
available for comment, the Real Deal
added.
