Subject: Meet? 
Mr. **Weinberg** — 
I am a reporter with the **ABC News** investigative unit. We are gathering background research on the major candidates 
for President. 
Seeing that both former President **CLINTON** and Mr. Trump have been mentioned in connection to the **Jeffrey **Epstein**** 
case, I am interested in better understanding the case, it's current status, and any information that could help explain 
Mr. **Epstein**'s dealings and interactions with both men. 
I would very much appreciate the chance to meet and discuss this subject in an off the record conversation at your 
earliest convenience. 
Please let me know if that would be possible, and if so, when and where we could meet. 
Many thanks, 
Matthew
