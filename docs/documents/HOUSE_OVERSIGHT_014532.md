2017 OUTLOOK
Dear Clients,
Readers of our previous Outlook publications may recall that this page typically
summarizes the key themes of our economic and financial market prospects for the
coming year. However, for 2017 we decided that a brief overview would not suffice,
given the current environment of high market valuations, great policy uncertainty,
significant geopolitical tensions and, in all likelihood, an unconventional US
presidency.
Since the trough of the global financial crisis, we have consistently emphasized US
preeminence and maintained a strategic overweight to US equities relative to global
market capitalization-weighted benchmarks. Tactically, we have had an overweight
allocation to US equities and US high yield bonds from as early as mid-2008. Even
when US equities became more expensive, we continued to recommend that clients
stay fully invested at their strategic allocations. Indeed, we have reiterated that
recommendation in our past Outlook publications, client calls and Sunday Night
Insight reports as many as 59 times since January 2010.
But now we have crossed into the 10th decile of valuations: US equities have been
more expensive than current levels only 10% of the time in the post-WWII period.
Yet we continue to recommend staying the course. We are duly aware that this
recommendation is long in the tooth, particularly given such high valuations and the
unusually high level of policy uncertainty.
Policy uncertainty, both economic and political, abounds globally: uncertainty with
respect to Brexit (the how and when), upcoming elections in Germany and France
(the who), transitional government in Italy (the how long followed by what) and new
appointments to the Standing Committee in China and their significance (the who and
what of any reform agenda), to name a few.
We are also facing rising geopolitical tensions that could trigger significant market
volatility. Tensions in the Middle East will not abate. Greater Russian involvement
in that region is stabilizing in some respects and destabilizing in others. Further
Russian incursions into Eastern Europe may elicit a more robust reaction from the
West. Terrorism could spread in the US and Europe as ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and
the Levant) loses territory in Iraq and Syria and foreign fighters return home. North
Outlook

Korea’s nuclear program and missile launches go unchecked. There is rising risk of
military incidents—or accidents—in the South China Sea and across the Taiwan Strait.
China is the most likely source of global economic shocks over the next two to
three years. The country’s leadership continues to prioritize imbalanced economic
growth over structural reforms, thereby increasing debt at an unsustainable pace. Such
increases will eventually prove to be destabilizing.
In Donald Trump, the US has elected an unconventional president in many
respects, including his more US-centric approach to China. If China responds to,
say, imposition of US tariffs on imports of Chinese products by sharply devaluing
the renminbi, significant downside volatility and tighter global financial conditions
will follow.
Given already high US equity valuations, uncertain economic and political policy
prospects and heightened geopolitical risks, readers may well ask why we continue to
recommend staying fully invested in US equities. Among the reasons:
• Our eight-year US preeminence theme is intact and continues into its ninth year.
As Professor Jeremy Siegel of **the University of Pennsylvania** wrote 23 years ago in
Stocks for the Long Run 1 and recently repeated in a **Wall Street Journal** interview, 2
“Stocks are the best long-run asset.” We refine that view by saying US equities are
the best long-run asset.
• We think that the policy backdrop in the US will be particularly favorable for
the economy, with looser fiscal policy, relatively easy monetary policy and a less
stringent regulatory environment. We expect US growth to continue through 2017.
• We expect global growth to improve modestly, from 2.5% in 2016 to 2.9%
