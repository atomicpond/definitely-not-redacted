From: **Jeffrey Epstein** <jeevacation@gmail.com> 
To: **Jes Staley** <___________________________________>; 
the more time you have to announce the better. lye set up you and **PETER** to meet in **Davos** with darling, it would 
be better afterwards to announce. I would go slowly, this can set the stage for lots to come. Obama really 
wants a fight. its crzy. " They took bailout money and then......" the problems are all inherited , not of his 
doing, he reached out a hand to help and was taken advantage of-, typical but problematic.
