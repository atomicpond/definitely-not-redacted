How **Jim** Yong **Kim**, Obama's ****World Bank**** Pick, 
Changed Global Health Aid 
By Massoud Hayoun 
Mar 23 2012, 2:04 PM ET 
The international **Public Health** work that made **Kim**, now the president's nominee for ****World Bank**** head, such a 
respected figure. 
**President Obama** introduces **Jim** Yong **Kim** as his nominee to be the next president of **the ****World Bank****** /Reuters 
**President Obama** announced **today** that he will nominate Dartmouth College President **Jim** Yong **Kim** to head 
**the ****World Bank******. Although **Kim** is a physician by training, officials have observed that **Kim**'s role as a key 
player in global health and development, notably with his role in the organization Partners in Health (PIH), 
makes him a key candidate to change the attitudes of developing-world nations. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 028781 
The following excerpts from Tracy Kidder's Mountains Beyond Mountains, a biography of anthropologist and 
physician **Paul** Farmer, detail **Kim**'s bold efforts to combat international HIV and tuberculosis epidemics with 
PIH: 
Some months after the official founding of PIH, [co-founder] **Paul** Farmer expanded the group, adding a fellow 
**Harvard** anthropology and medical student, a Korean American named **Jim** Yong **Kim**... Farmer offered what 
for **Jim** **Kim** was a convincing vision of the new organization. The reality was less impressive -- a charity with a 
board of advisers and no hired staff... 
They talked about issues such as political correctness, which **Jim** **Kim** defined as follows: "It's a very well-
crafted tool to distract us. A very self-centered activity. Clean up your own vocabulary so you can show 
everybody you have the social capital of having been in circles where these things are talked about on a regular 
basis." (What was an example of political correctness? Some academic types would say to **Jim** and **Paul**, "Why 
do you call your patients poor people? They don't call themselves poor people." **Jim** would reply: "Okay, how 
about soon-dead people?") 
They talked about the insignificance of "cultural barriers" when it came to the Haitian peasant's acceptance of 
modern Western medicine: "There's nothing like a cure for a disease to change people's cultural values"... 
By now **Peru** was taxing PIH's resources severely. On average, the drugs to treat just one patient cost between 
fifteen and twenty thousand dollars. And the number of patients kept growing. Already there were about fifty 
Carabayllanos in treatment. Their average age was twenty-nine. They were students, unemployed youths, 
housewives, street vendors, bus drivers, health workers. The actual numbers seemed small, but those fifty MDR 
[a form of tuberculosis that does not respond to standard treatment] cases represented about 10 percent of all 
active cases of TB in the slum, about ten times more than might have been expected. No telling how many 
others they had been infecting as they'd traveled around Lima, coughing. No telling either how many people in 
other parts of the city already had MDR, but [there were] reports of hundreds in other neighborhoods. In 
Carabayllo itself, the Socios workers found entire families sick and dying with what turned out to be genetically 
related strains of the disease--a phenomenon common enough that the health workers gave it a name, familias 
tebeceanas, tuberculosis families. 
**Kim**'s organization confronted **Peru**'s MDR-form tuberculosis epidemic with what some have called unorthodox 
practices -- borrowing and cajoling its way into medicine for its patients. 
Howard Hiatt, a friend of **Jim** Yong **Kim**'s and a former dean at the ****Harvard** School** of **Public Health**, said he 
was concerned about how PIH was getting medicine to combat the epidemic: 
"Sure enough. **Paul** and **Jim** would stop at the [**Harvard**-affiliated] Brigham pharmacy before they left for **Peru** 
and fill their briefcases with drugs. They had sweet-talked various people into letting them walk away with the 
drugs." [Hiatt] was amused, all in all. "That's their Robin Hood attitude." In fact, they'd only borrowed the 
drugs... 
Then **one day** the president of the Brigham stopped Hiatt in a corridor. "Your friends Farmer and **Kim** are in 
trouble with me. They owe this hospital ninety-two thousand dollars." Hiatt looked into the matter. "Sure 
enough. **Paul** and **Jim** would stop at the Brigham pharmacy before they left for **Peru** and fill their briefcases with 
drugs. They had sweet-talked various people into letting them walk away with the drugs." He was amused, all in 
all. "That's their Robin Hood attitude." 
To many seasoned managers of **Public Health** projects, what Farmer and **Kim** were doing would have looked 
quite reckless--like a stunt, as some would later insinuate. They didn't
