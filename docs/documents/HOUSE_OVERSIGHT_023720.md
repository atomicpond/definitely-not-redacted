Is Shame Necessary?
Jennifer Jacquet
Jennifer Jacquet graduated with a master’s degree in environmental economics from Cornell
University in **2004** and earned a PhD in 2009 from the University of **British Columbia**, where
she now holds a postdoctoral fellowship. As part of the Sea Around Us Project, a joint
collaboration between the university and the Pew Charitable Trusts, she researches marketbased
conservation initiatives related to seafood and other natural resources. With colleagues
from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology and UBC’s Mathematics Department,
she is currently conducting a series of games and experiments to study the effects of honor and
shame on cooperation.
Financial executives received almost $20 billion in bonuses in 2008 amid a serious financial
crisis and a $245 billion government bailout. In 2008, more than 3 million American homes went
into foreclosure because of mortgage blunders those same executives helped facilitate. **Citigroup**
proposed to buy a $50-million corporate jet in **early 2009**, shortly after receiving $45-billion in
taxpayer funds. Days later, **President Obama** took note in an **Oval Office** interview. About the
jet, he said, “They should know better.” And the bonuses, he said, were “shameful.”
What is shame’s purpose? Is shame still necessary? These are questions I’m asking
myself. After all, it is not just bankers we have to worry about. Most social dilemmas exhibit a
similar tension between individual and group interest. Energy, food, and water shortages, climate
disruption, declining fisheries, increasing antibiotic resistance, the threat of nuclear warfare—all
can be characterized as tragedies of the commons, in which the choices of individuals conflict
with the greater good.
Balancing group- and self-interest has never been easy, yet human societies display a
high level of cooperation. To attain that level, specialized traits had to evolve, including such
emotions as shame. 1 Shame is what is supposed to occur after an individual fails to cooperate

with the group. Shame regulates social behavior and serves as a forewarning of punishment:
Conform or suffer the consequences. The earliest feelings of shame were likely over issues of
waste management, greediness, and incompetence. While guilt is evoked by an individual’s
standards, shame is the result of group standards. Therefore, shame, unlike guilt, is felt only in
the context of other people.
The first hominids could keep track of cooperation and defection only by firsthand
observation. Many animals use visual observations to decide whether to work with others. Reef
fish in the **Red Sea**, for instance, watch wrasses clean other reef fish, to determine whether or not
they’re cooperative, as biologist Redouan Bshary discovered. Bshary went scuba diving off
**Egypt**’s coast to observe this symbiotic relationship. Bluestreak cleaner wrasses (Labroides
dimidiatus) eat parasites, along with dead or infected tissue, off reef fishes in more than 2,000
interactions a day, each of which can be considered an act of cooperation. Wrasses are tempted
to eat more than just the parasites, but if the reef fish loses too much flesh in the deal, it will
refuse to continue working with the wrasse. Reef fish approach wrasses that they see cooperating
with their current clients and avoid the wrasses they see biting off more than they should chew. 2
Like the Bluestreak cleaner wrasses, humans are also more cooperative when they sense
they are being watched. Researchers at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne examined the
effect of a pair of eyes on payments for tea and coffee to an honesty box. Alternating images of
flowers and human faces were posted above the box in the university coffee room **each week** for
ten **weeks**; researchers found that people paid nearly three times as much for their drinks in

**weeks** during which they were exposed to the human gaze. 3
The feeling of being watched enhances cooperation and so does the ability to watch
others. To try to know what others are doing is a fundamental part of being human. So is fitting
in. The more collectivist the human society, the more important it is to conform and the more
prominent the role of shame. 4 Shame serves as a warning to adhere to group standards or be
prepared for peer punishment. Many individualistic societies, however, have migr
