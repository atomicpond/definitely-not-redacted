**Hi Jeffrey**, 
Please find attached **InsightsPod** business plan for your consideration. 
Since **Twitter** is live streaming the presidential debates, the social media activity will accelerate and it will help 
us in making better predictions of outcome. It was apparent from the US Election report, which I sent you 
previously that we need a Data Scientist who can translate our data into better insights. Taking this into 
account I hope you can help us by backing this venture. 
Thanks, 
Zubair
