Prince Andrew sex allegations: Jeffrey 
**Epstein**'s butler **Alfredo Rodriguez**, who 
stole tell-all 'black book', dies age 60 
Rodriguez served prison time after refusing to hand over **Epstein**'s (pictured) book in **2011** 
and attempting to sell it for over £30,000 
Loulla-Mae Eleftheriou-Smith 
**Wednesday**, 7 January 2015 
**Alfredo Rodriguez**, the butler of convicted sex offender **Jeffrey **Epstein****, has died, and with 
him the location of a `black book', which allegedly details "the full scope and the extent of 
**Epstein**'s involvement with underage girls", and contact details of the businessman's 
celebrity friends. 
Rodriguez died at the age of 60 after suffering from mesothelioma **last week**, his widow 
Patricia Dunn told DailvMail.com.  
Dunn alleges that her late husband 'knew all about Prince Andrew," who has been named in 
the current sex scandal centring on **Epstein**. Allegations levelled at the Prince are that he 
was supplied with a teenage girl who was used by **Epstein** as a "sex slave". Buckingham 
Palace has denied the allegation. 
The 'black book' that Rodriguez had in his possession is journal in which **Epstein** is 
understood to have detailed the girls which attended his properties for "massages" for him 
and his friends, and details of his celebrity friends and associates who had no connection 
with alleged offences, including Bill Clinton and Donald Trump. 
**Jeffrey **Epstein****: Controversies surrounding paedophile billionaire  
Rodriguez, who stole the book, claimed he needed it as insurance against the businessman 
to protect his own life. 
The butler failed to tell prosecutors he possessed the book and later refused to hand it over. 
He was jailed for **18 months** for attempting to sell it for $50,000 (01,000). 
In **2011** it emerged that the journal "detailed the full scope and the extent of **Epstein**'s 
involvement with underage girls," according to prosecuting lawyers, who referred to it as 
"The Holy Grail". 
Rodriguez died on 28 December. The current location of the document has not been 
disclosed and the Mirror claims  **Epstein**'s lawyers are "petrified" about where it will go, 
according to a source.
