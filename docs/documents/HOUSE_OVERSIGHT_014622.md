Top 10 US Ideas – 1Q17
The backdrop for risk assets has changed dramatically over the past year. As Michael
Hartnett pointed out, 2016 saw global interest rates fall to 5,000-year lows and the
likely end of what has been the greatest bull market in bonds ever. We experienced a
historic US Presidential election and Republican sweep of Congress on November 9th.
Later that same month, OPEC reached a historic deal to reduce crude production by
1.2mn b/d with non-OPEC producers delivering an additional 600k b/d of cuts – the first
such joint curb since 1998. Risk assets responded with 30-year Treasury reaching a
yield of 2.088% in July, US equity markets reaching all-time highs, and oil prices rallying
more than 40% since the start of the year. Given the Republican sweep - and the
resulting likelihood that the logjam of Washington gridlock will be broken - our Top 10
stock selections are more heavily geared toward companies that may benefit from
increased fiscal stimulus, a more pro-business agenda, and/or tax-policy reform. Our
current strategy stands in stark contrast to our stance last year of looking for defensive
growth ideas.

Top 10 US Ideas Quarterly
Our Top 10 US Ideas are based on our view that these companies could have the most
significant market and business related catalysts over the next three months. The list
reflects primarily a bottoms-up approach, with calendar-specific events noted for most
stocks. We constructed our list by canvassing BofAML Fundamental Equity Research
analysts in order to find 10 BofAML-covered stocks which we think will significantly
outperform or underperform peers during the quarter. We considered only Buy-rated
names for outperform ideas and Underperform-rated names for underperform ideas. We
then narrowed the list after consulting our Equity Research colleagues.
To be eligible for the list, the stock must be covered by BofA Merrill Lynch AMRS
fundamental equity analysts with a rating of Buy or Underperform, for long and short
stock recommendations, respectively.
Stocks will be chosen on a discretionary basis by the Alpha Generation team, which
currently includes strategists with experience choosing stocks for BofAML’s US 1 list.
Stocks will be chosen for the list using a bottoms-up approach after taking into account
the views of the relevant BofA Merrill Lynch Fundamental Equity analyst and upcoming
catalysts. Diversity of the list and BofAML macro views will also b
