**Palm Beach Post** Editorial #1 
He was over 50. And they were girls 
By Elisa Cramer 
HASH(Ox5fa474) 
Friday, August 04, 2006 
If the women whom Palm Beach police say a part-time town resident invited to his home 
and paid for sex acts were, in fact, women, the solicitation charge against **Jeffrey Epstein** 
might feel more sufficient. But, according to police records, they weren't. He was over 
50. And they were girls. 14. 15.16.17-year-old girls. That should count for something - 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030299 
the difference between prostitution and pedophilia. 
So, it is baffling that Mr. Epstein, who was indicted last month by a grand jury on one 
felony count of solicitation of prostitution, has not been charged, as Palm Beach police 
strenuously urged, with unlawful sex acts with a minor and lewd and lascivious 
molestation. 
Conviction of crimes against minors would mean steeper penalties than the maximum 
five-year prison term Mr. Epstein faces if convicted of the single count of felony 
solicitation. It also would help carry a message of intolerance to perverts who prey on 
girls. 
Prosecutors did not pursue charges against Mr. Epstein reflecting the age of the victims 
because they assumed a jury would view the girls not as victims but as promiscuous, 
untrustworthy, willing participants. The presumption is offensive. 
Mr. Epstein, a 53-year-old Manhattan money manager who has hired Harvard law 
professor Alan Dershowitz and defense attorney **Jack Goldberger**, has denied knowing 
how old the girls were. But police interviews with five alleged victims and 17 witnesses 
under oath, as well as phone messages, a high school transcript and other items that 
police found from searching Mr. Epstein's trash and 7,234-square-foot waterfront home, 
provide evidence that he knew the girls were teenagers. 
One girl couldn't show up when Mr. Epstein wanted because she had soccer. Another 
time, Mr. Epstein had to wait for his "massage" session because the girl he wanted was 
still in class. 
Why didn't State Attorney **Barry Krischer** let a jury decide whether to believe the 
teenagers - including a 16-year-old who went to Mr. Epstein's house to "work" in 
December 2004 after being asked whether she needed to make money for Christmas 
gifts? 
Prosecutors gave greater weight to the details Mr. Dershowitz provided about the girls in 
an apparent effort to assail their character. Mr. Dershowitz pointed out to prosecutors that 
some of the teenagers had talked on myspace.com about marijuana and alcohol use. 
The 20-year-old **Royal Palm Beach** woman who told police she recruited girls for Mr. 
Epstein has a Web page on myspace.com that features one girl using the name "Pimpin' 
Made EZ." 
Although no charges of witness tampering have been filed, the parents of at least one of 
the teenage victims complained to police of being followed and intimidated by two men. 
Police determined that their vehicles were registered to two private investigators. Mr. 
Goldberger denied knowing anything about it. 
Police also note in their reports that the state attorneys office offered Mr. Epstein a plea 
deal that would have placed him on probation for five years, allowing him ultimately to 
walk away with no criminal record at all. 
I asked Mr. Krischer's spokesman, Mike Edmondson, why the case was referred to a 
grand jury instead of Mr. Epstein being charged and facing a trial before a jury. And 
shouldn't the victims credibility be a factor to determine whether a crime's been 
committed, not whether a jury will convict? (After all, as Mr. Goldberger told The Palm 
Beach Post of Mr. Epstein, "He's never denied girls came to the house.") 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030300 
Especially, I asked Mr. Edmondson to explain: Why shouldn't the public look at this case 
and think there are two kinds of justice - one for the wealthy and one for the rest of us? 
Mr. Edmondson said he could not comment on the case because it is active, but on the 
latter point, he offered, for the sake of "philosophical debate": "Whet
