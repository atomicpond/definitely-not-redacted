It won't take long to do. We're just swamped. I'll get something to you when I can. 
My biggest fear about taking this job is that there wouldn't be enough to do. You told me that concern was 
crazy. You were right.

On our to-do list, but back of the envelope, we satisfied ourselves that after depreciation, we would show a 
profit. (In part because **Apollo** charter payments factor in depreciation.)

Adding Internet and possibly changing cushions. I recommended we do it with the 4 year inspection in the 
spring, but haven't heard back from him. I think I talked him out of automating the divans. I agreed with 
what you said about that.

GV is in inspection and going well. Not sure what renovations you mean? 
On depreciation, we think we cannot use accelerated due to foreign travel preponderance, and obviously 
can't use bonus because not new. We think we are stuck with straight-line depreciation which will be
