So he didn't read the affidavit?

Subject: RE: <no subject> 
He verified the affidavit- like a notary- verifying/swearing to only the fact that the officer who filled it out and signed it 
was who he purports to be. When an officer does that for the officer drafting the document that is all he is doing- he is 
not swearing to the contents of the document or their veracity- just like any other notary. Make sense?

Hi, Tonja, 
I'm not going to get into this in this story, but I'd still like you to address the state's contention that Kogan signed the resisting 
arrest charge against Hart. What happened?
