good, how are you? 
Well, I just sent this email to Brockman: 
Hey **John**, 
I've been working on an article for the Village Voice but it seems to be 
evolving into a relatively short book — 3 segments: 
TRUMP THE REPUBLICAN ELEPHANT 
A Funny Thing Happened On the Way to the Inauguration 
Lies, Jokes, Fake News, and Alternative Facts 
I Was a Dishonest Journalist Between **Breitbart** and Bannon 
[Will Durst has agreed to write an intro.] 
Please let me know if you'd like to consider the possibility of representing 
this. 
As ever, 
p aul
