Warning: The Smart Money 
Is Fleeing U.S. Stocks 
BY **BILL** BONNER, CHAIRMAN, BONNER & PARTNERS 
DUBLIN — The **Dow** dropped 180 points **yesterday** — or 
about 1%. 
And another clever billionaire says he is looking elsewhere 
for profits. **Reuters**: 
Activist investor **Carl Icahn** on **Monday** said there was a chance the stock 
market could suffer a big decline, saying valuations are rich and earnings at 
many companies are fueled more by low borrowing costs than management's 
efforts to boost results. 
"I am very cautious on equities **today**. This market could easily have a big 
drop," Icahn said. 
Yes, dear reader, the smart money is getting out of U.S. stocks. And here's our 
old friend Rob Marstrand explaining why: 
Right now, every measure that analyzes the S&P 500 says it's expensive. Prices 
are high relative to earnings, net assets, sales, and cash flow. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 031136 
What's more, there's plenty of evidence that the main thing propping up the 
stock prices is heavy buying by the companies themselves [via share 
repurchases]. 
And now, that prop is getting kicked out from under the stock market. 
**Bloomberg**: 
After snapping up trillions of dollars of their own stock in a **five-**year**** 
shopping binge that dwarfed every other buyer, U.S. companies from Apple 
Inc. to IBM Corp. just put on the brakes. 
Announced repurchases dropped 38% to $244 billion in the last four months, 
the biggest decline since **2009**...

Rickards: "Warning, I've Changed My Thesis On Gold" 
I firmly believe we're at the beginning of the BIGGEST move the world 
has ever seen in gold. "Simple math" says $10,000 gold is all but certain. But, you're 
not going to believe what I have to say next... BEFORE you buy a single ounce of 
gold, read this important message. 
Last Chance: VIP Access To Doug Casey's Shocking **2016** 
Forecast 
Casey fears a severe crisis is brewing. Not a currency collapse or stock market crash. 
A specific threat that could wreak more havoc than the Great Depression. That's why 
**tomorrow**, in an urgent broadcast event, Doug's pulling back the curtain on his 
shocking warning. And revealing how to profit from it in **the months ahead**, in a big 
way. Last chance to get VIP access ends tonight. Click here now for full details. 
Pareto's "Foxes" 
Although the bull market in U.S. stocks is probably near its end, the bull 
market in **the Deep State** shows no sign of weakening. 
**year** after **year**, the power of the "foxes" grows. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 031137 
It was the great Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto who noticed — among other 
things — that no matter what kind of government you think you have, there are 
always some crafty insiders, the "foxes," who take control of it. 
Policies are set, programs are started... decisions are made... with no consent 
of the people or their elected officials; the foxes work the angles. 
Over time, the forces of law and order become more and more corrupt.., as the 
foxes bend the entire system to do their bidding. 
Wars are started with no plan or intention to win them. Money is handed out 
for no better reason than this: They can get away with it. 
And best of all, most people are none the wiser; they believe the myths... and 
attack anyone who challenges them. 
Rip-Off 
Perhaps the biggest rip-off of all time has taken place over **the last eight years** 
— and in plain sight of everybody. 
Via the magic of ultra-low rates, the **Fed** — a nest for the wiliest and most 
cunning of the foxes — took roughly $8 trillion out of the pockets of savers and 
retirees and handed it to borrowers. 
Who is the world's biggest borrower? 
Yes... it's **the Deep State** itself. 
The **Fed** claimed to be helping to "stimulate" the economy. But you can't really 
stimulate an economy by stealing from the people who produce wealth and 
provide it with capital. 
Not surprisingly, growth has stalled. Wages have fallen. Productivity has 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 031138 
stagnated. 
For 95% of the male population, real earnings are lower **today** than they were 
in **1973**. 
Is there any wonder many of these men vote for Donald **Trump** — a "strong 
man" who promises to do something about it? 
But the top 5% — where the foxes are — gained income. Their wages are up 
more than 50% over the same time. 
Why? 
Because they take more and more money from the rest of us. 
More **tomorrow**... on a new Rebellion in Gualfin... and a measure of how big 
**the Deep State** has become... 
Regards, 
**BILL** 
Further Reading: **the Deep State** already controls just about every aspect of 
American life. From health care to education to the food on our tables to the 
never-ending war on terror, this cadre of cronies is pulling the strings. 
In his latest online presentation, **BILL** exposes how **the Deep State** has now 
pushed the world to the brink of an irreversible disaster. Learn more here as 
he reveals how
