**Jeffrey** - 
Please let me know if I can help in any way-
Story below-
Salacious new chapter in **Florida** billionaire's sex scandal 
effrey **Epstein** 
or years, the story of **South **Florida**** billionairemoney manager ****Jeffrey** **Epstein****— involving allegations of human trafficking, an international underage sex ring, a **Palm Beach** 
ansion, a private island inthe **Caribbean**, and an FBI investigation— has been tabloid fodder inthe United States and **the United Kingdom**. 
o, ****Fort Lauderdale**** lawyer **Brad **Edwards**** is helping to write a new chapter inthis murky and sordid tale. Representing two alleged victims identified only as **Jane Doe**#3 and Jane 
oe #4, **Edwards** filed a motion in U.S. ****District Court**** in ****West **Palm Beach****** that alleges well-known criminal defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz and Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, 
ere involved in **Epstein**'s international sex ring. 
'There's absolutelyno kemel of truth to this story," said Dershowitz, who represented **Epstein**. "I don't know this woman. I've never been inthe same place with her. She's made up 
he whole story completely from whole cloth." 
dwards' motionrequests that his new clients jointhe case of two other alleged victims — identified as **Jane Doe** #1 and **Jane Doe**#2 in courtrecords — who are attempting to use the 
me Victims' **Rights Act** to force **the U.S. Department of Justice** to prosecute **Epstein** for sex trafficking of children by fraud and use of interstate commerce to entice a minor to 
ommit prostitution, among other offenses. 
wealthy Wall Streetmoney manager who had once attempted to purchase **New York** magazine, **Epstein** traveled the world in circles that included President Bill Clinton and 
usinessman Donald Trump. Despite his vast fortune and mansion in **PalmBeach**, **Epstein** kept a low profile and wasn't a regular inthe wealthy island's social scene. 
he low profile vanished in 2005, when a woman contacted the **Palm Beach** police fearing that **Epstein** had molestedher **14-year-old** daughter. The girl told detectives she'd been 
nvited to **Epstein**'s mansion, where she was paid $300 after stripping to her underwear and massaging **Epstein** as he masturbated. Police then located a community college student 
who gave a sworn statement that she had taken six girls, all betweenthe ages of 14 and 16, to **Epstein**. 
olice referred the case to the FBI. In **September 2007**, Dershowitz helped **Epstein** negotiate a then-secret non-prosecu on agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office, which deferred 
o the ****Palm Beach** County** State Attorney's Office for criminal charges, courtrecords show.

Salacious new chapter n **Florida** billionaire's sex scandal I **the Miami Herald** 1/2/15 6:11 PM 
**In 2008**, **Epstein** pleaded guilty to a state charge of solicitingprostitution with a minor and served **13 months** of an **18-month** sentence. 
After his conviction, **Epstein**'s story grew even more bizarre, with anonymous women accusinghim in federal court of conspiring with **Ghislaine **Maxwell****, daughter of the late British 
mediabaron **Robert **Maxwell****, to operate an international underage sex ring. 
**Edwards**, the ****Fort Lauderdale**** lawyer, and **Paul Cassell**, a former federal judge who now teaches law at **the University of Utah**, filed a **Jane Doe** lawsuit against the U.S. government in 
**July 2008**, alleging that **Epstein** had committed crimes against their clients, including sex trafficking of children by fraud. 
The case, whichhas been pending for more than sixyears before U.S. District JudgeKenneth A. Marra, initially involved two women, identified as **Jane Doe**#1 and **Jane Doe** #2, who 
said they were sexually abused by **Epstein** and trafficked as minors. 
On Dec.30, 2014, **Edwards** asked to have two new accusers added to the case —identified as **Jane Doe** #3 and **Jane Doe** #4. 
**Jane Doe**#3 alleges inthe court filing that **Maxwell** and **Epstein** kept her as a "sex slave" from 1999 through20002, when she escaped to an unspecified foreign country. 
**Epstein** forced **Jane Doe**#3, who was then a minor, to have sex with politically connected and wealthy people , the court filing alleges. 
"**Epstein**'s purpose in 'lending' **Jane Doe** [along with otheryoung girls] to such powerful people [was] to ingratiate himself with them for business, personal, political and financial 
gain, as well as to obtain blackmail information," the filing alleges. 
**Jane Doe**#3 identifies one of the men she was forced to have sex with as Dershowitz, a former **Harvard** lawprofessorandhigh- profile criminal defense lawyer.
