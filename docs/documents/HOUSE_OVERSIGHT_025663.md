What is Blockchain Technology?

Illustrative Schematic: Centralized Network versus Distributed Network
Centralized Network
Distributed Network
• Blockchain is the critical and differentiating infrastructure that underlies cryptocurrencies.
• Unlike most networks today, which rely on a centralized hub, a blockchain is a public distributed network whose
complete database can be accessed and maintained by each member of the network.
• The blockchain is a shared and continually reconciled database. As new transactions occur, data is quickly
disseminated to, verified, and incorporated across all nodes on the network.
• Because it has no single maintainer, the blockchain’s history is resistant to editing by a malicious actor.

• Banks are focused on blockchain technology for post-trade
settlement and clearing, with aims to:
� Streamline equities settlement from T+2 to T+0.
• Potential to securely link identity and payment credentials to
a unique individual.
� Benefit peer-to-peer businesses reliant on counterparty
trust.
� Streamline compliance and anti-money laundering
surveillance.
• ****Goldman Sachs**** **Global Investment Research** expects limited blockchain adoption over the next 2-5 years, and broader

Capital market adoption may take over **10 years**, given regulatory oversight and the multitude of participants.
