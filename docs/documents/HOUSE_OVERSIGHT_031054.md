[7:07 PM] Jeffrey E.:
  I assume you are still close to invanka . if so , there are a few of his heavy hitter friends that would like to help ( me not included of course ). I think a war council. schwartzman wynn, rudy, lorber lefrak.you barrack , should be called in to give suggestions . weissleburg , cohen pecker all together doesn't bode well. . I didn't add bannon as i know ivanka hates him. though as you said about bedfellows . he would be a good addition if it wasn't for his baggage .

[7:15 PM] Jeffrey E.:
  and not sure he will actually follow any advice but you could try .
