White Castle. Twenty five years ago, I had a friend with a peculiar way of responding to seeing things he didn’t like on TV: he
would throw White Castle hamburgers at the screen. I always thought this was a bad way to waste a good hamburger, but I had
one of those moments the other night when watching news reports on debt ceiling discussions. Media outlets have referred to
**President Reagan**’s scolding of Congressional Republicans for delaying debt ceiling increases, and the 18 increases that took
place during his Presidency. The implication: reservations about raising the debt ceiling are as irresponsible now as they were
then. This is a disingenuous argument; in the 1980’s, the debt ceiling being debated was 50% of GDP, and had no
bearing on the solvency of the United States. Today, the proposed increase raises the debt limit twice as high, measured
relative to GDP or government revenues. While a default is a very bad idea (deserving of a White Castle hurling of its own),
unconstrained debt growth with no plan to slow it is bad as well. Some suggest we not worry about debt growth, since demand
from foreign central banks and **the **Federal Reserve**** would keep yields in check. That logic is irresponsible at best. Debt limit
legislation is a rocky but healthy way for a democracy to decide whether mega-deficits are in the long-term public interest.

Over **the last few days**, the Gang of Six plan, the Reid-McConnell plan and the Obama-Boehner plan have all been
raised up the flagpole and then lowered. By the end of the process, we’re still looking for deficit reduction of $3 trillion+
over **10 years** (relative to the CBO Alternative case in which there is no deficit reduction at all). However, **Congress** is running
short on time, and may have to do a smaller debt ceiling increase/deficit reduction first. For now, we wait to see the balance of
spending cuts and revenue increases 1 will be agreed to. ****last week**’s** Profiles in Courage piece walked through the history and
dynamics of this process, so we won’t repeat that here. Here’s our take on what has been proposed so far, with the caveat
that many plans are not crystal clear what baseline they are using 2 , or what steps they recommend to get to that baseline first.

All tax cuts extended; AMT indexed to inflation;
no **Medicare** reimbursement cuts
Cuts to discretionary and entitlement spending
Defense cuts,discretionary spending reductions
Top two brackets return to 2001 levels; phaseout
of itemized deductions; some discretionary
spending cuts; **Medicare** reimbursement freeze
Discretionary and entitlement cuts (CPI chain
weighting), limit on itemized deductions, "bracket
creep" (faster migration to higher tax brackets)
All tax cuts return to 2001 levels; AMT no longer
indexed to inflation; **Medicare** reimbursement
cuts to Doctors proceed as planned
Tax rates lowered, combined with reduction in
deductions to generate net tax revenue increase;
cuts to discretionary and entitlement spending
1 On the AMT: the Tax Policy Center estimates that if the AMT is not indexed to inflation, it would impact 31 million filers in 2012 (and
raise $132 billion in revenue), compared to 4 million filers in 2011 (and $39 billion in revenue).
2 For example: the Gang of Six state that they used the President’s budget as a baseline (scored by CBO in **March 2011**), reduced deficits by
$3.7 trillion, and ended up with a 71% debt/GDP ratio; but they do not explain how they get to the President’s baseline in the first place.

I have a feeling that revenue increases will be a material (e.g., 25% or more) part of the deal. The Peterson Foundation’s
sampling of 6 policy groups shown below indicate that 5 of 6 recommend revenue increases compared to where we are today;
the **Heritage Foundation**’s “Woody Guthrie Memorial Budget Plan” is the only exception. What kind of revenue increases?
Raising the top two brackets, which would affect joint filers with
