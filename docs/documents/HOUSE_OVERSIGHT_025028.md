FACTOR 
iur Sirussle to see. the True 'Threat 
**FrontPage Interview**'s guest today is Bill Siegel, a lawyer and 
business executive. He has been a producer of several documentary films and assists numerous non-profit 
organizations. He is the author of ****the **Control Factor****: Our Struggle** to See the True Threat. 
FP: Bill Siegel, welcome to **FrontPage Interview**. 
Congratulations on this brilliant book. It is without question one of the most vital works of our time. 
Let's begin with what inspired you to write it. 
Siegel: Thanks for having me Jamie. As a young boy born in the mid 1950s, I was fascinated with footage 
of Hitler and **the Third Reich** and could never understand how the Jews of the time could not see the evil 
that seemed so obvious. Not yet appreciative of the benefit of hindsight, I could not comprehend the 
blindness. Following 9/11, like so many others, I began to study Islam, its history, its current movements, 
terrorism and so on. As I would learn one stunning aspect after another, I would discuss them with friends 
and associates. Rather than confront the facts I would present, they would find one clever way after another 
to avoid the frightening truth of what America and the West truly face. Their fear appeared obvious to me. I 
began to catalog many of my friends' different maneuvers to dispel the anxiety that they found so difficult 
to endure. The more I focused on their mental processes (as well as my own) the more I began to see a 
structure to the mental endeavor and to understand what I had, as a child, found so difficult to explain. 
FP: Tell us about **the **Control Factor****, what you describe as "that effort our minds enga ge in in order to keep 
us blind" and that "process of a voiding seeing the threats we face." It's also about, as you state, trying to

believe that the threat is under our control, when in fact it is not. Kindly enlighten us as to these profound 
insights you make in terms of **the **Control Factor****. 
Siegel: First, let's distinguish the "real world" where real battles are taking place from the mental battlefield 
which occurs in each of our minds. We tend to believe our perceptions are simply clear realizations of what 
is "out there" and overlook how much our internal worlds can literally determine what we see. When our 
internal minds become anxious and sense a loss of "control," they tend to concoct ways to distort our 
perceptions so as to restore that sense of inner control. I describe **the **Control Factor**** as an "active and 
continuous process" designed to maintain that sense, if not illusion, of control. We natural ly think that our 
thinking and feeling processes are passive; that they just happen. Yet when faced with truly frightening 
prospects, the mind is geared to actively distort. 
Similarly, the sense of control must be continuously maintained so **the **Control Factor**** operates constantly. 
In turn, the sum of this active and continuous undertaking makes these perceptions all the more familiar and 
thus seemingly all the more "real." In one sense, **the **Control Factor**** is the mechanism of what Andy 
McCarthy entit
