Dear **barry**, 
When it comes to describing **Donald Trump's** private jet, the word 
"impressive" would be an understatement. The presumptive **Republican Party** 
nominee bought the **Boeing** 757-200 from **Microsoft** co-founder Paul Allen 
and he spared no expense kitting it out. Dubbed "Trump Force One," the 
luxurious jet is equipped with a shower, gold-plated seatbelt buckles and a 
52-inch flatscreen with a library of 1,000 movies. Built in **1991**, the 757 is 
estimated to have cost approximately $100 million. **If Trump** reaches the 
****White House**** in **November**, he'll have to exchange his personal jet for the 
presidential fleet, two highly modified **Boeing** 747-200Bs. The aircraft used by 
the president were built in **1986** and operate with the **Air Force** One callsign 
when the president is onboard. Will switching jets prove one of Trump's few 
regrets if he becomes president? 
Even though it cannot boast gold-plated accessories, **Air Force** One is a 
larger aircraft, seating 70 passengers in comfort compared to Trump Force 
..11141,

One's 43. The presidential jet is also slightly faster with a range of about 
6,800 nautical miles compared to 4,100 for a 757. A VC-25A can also be 
refuelled in mid-air by a tanker, extending its range even further. 
The two presidential planes cost $325 million each and their cost of operation 
comes to $179,750 per hour. The hourly cost of operation for a standard 757 
is just over $8,000 by comparison, though the taxpayer will pick up the higher 
bill for **Air Force** One. All that bling certainly inflated the cost of Trump Force 
One but **Air Force** One is expensive because it's packed with equipment and 
facilities to keep the president and his or her entourage safe at all times. 
There is a hospital onboard, electronic countermeasures and heavy shielding 
to afford protection in the event of an electromagnetic pulse during a nuclear 
attack. All in all, **If Trump** does end up travelling regularly on **Air Force** One, 
he probably won't regret trading in his gold seatbelt buckle for the presidential 
suite on one of the most sophisticated airliners in the world.
