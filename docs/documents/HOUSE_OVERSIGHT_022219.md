Importance: High 
My initial estimate, given to me by Pablos, was 25, and that was based solely on his quick look at the situation, and 
not knowing what was really out there. In fact, as I have repeated many times, the job was far far worse that 
originally expected, you have a dedicated group of people trying to undo and damage you, including now, they have 
started up in **the last week** full force again, as it is obvious that they can't fux with your wild page any more as we 
blocked that.. The woman from **The ****daily** Beast****. We have programs that track this stuff, and so, for the past few 
days, Mike has been having a cyber war with her minions, who are actively trying to undo what we are doing, as she 
is trying to push her ****daily** Beast** and other articles back up. So, we have to go back and push them back down. 
Then, there was the issue of trying to create additionally on you a positive web presence, with the science and org 
sites. 
I spend literally **four months** of non-stop work, creativity, and my own political capital to getyou this so far, which 
saved you not only time, but countless dollars, and isn't something that can be readily bought. I had people working 
also for free. I gained access to information that standard seo companies don't have. In addition, I wasted a lot of 
time talking to people who promise to help, but end up providing nothing, and so, I end up having to do it myself. 
What do I get in return, constant back slapping to my head... 
We were trying to fix up your mess. I didn't create it. Just thought it would be something to help. This was 
NEVER about trying to pull money out of you, and fact, we have don't everything possible to keep the costs down 
considerably. 
I must talk to you about the island thing asap. When can we do that?

Jeffrey, 
The hots did the sweep. Here are the new results taken as of a minute ago. You have only one negative article 
left on front page of **Google**, which is **The ****Huffington** Post**** article. **The ****Huffington** Post**** is extremely hard to 
move, because it is so powerful, has millions of links to it, and uploads massive new and original content it on 
a **daily** basis with posting from out side readers. We managed to push it down the page, as it used to be at the 
top. If we were able to post original content to both the science and the org site (absolutely not a single word to 
**this day** by Jessica, just talk), we would have been able to push it down even further, and off the page. WE did 
manage to get rid of **The ****daily** Beast**** article, which is now far removed, inspite of their own efforts to keep it 
prominent. 
Toxic suggested search engine terms that popped up automatically when you typed in your name are also now 
removed.

**Wikipedia** was an important victory, as it will always be at the top of the search engine results. ow the head 
lines do not mention convicted sex offender or pedophile. Instead, **Philanthrophic** work, **Epstein Foundation**, 
**Promotion of Scientists**. We have stopped the hacking on your **Wiki** site, and that was a major effor. Your **Wiki** 
entry now is pretty tame, and bad stuff has been muted, bowlerized, and pused to the bottom. Careful editing 
and wording has muted the effect immensely. We hacked the site to replace the mug shot and caption, and now 
has an entirely different photo and caption. This was a big success. 
We pushed the **Edge** all the way up to the front page, where it was previously buried on page 5 of **Google** 
search. 
We have promoted the other jeffrey epsteins, and other pages are also filled with your material. 
And, while the sites are up, and in the direction we hoped, they are still new, and subject to volitility, 
especially if new original content is not added on a minimum of a **weekly** basis. I have been forbideen to add 
new content to the **Philanthrophic** site as well as the science site, and therefore, as a result our rating slipped 
down (still on the first page, but would have liked them (and some of the articles to been able to push 
**Huffington** off page). We also helped with you images, and the first images that come of you on a **Google** 
search are not of your mug shot, etc. 
Your ****daily** Beast** foe is still at it, and trying to promote her sites against you in the same way that we try to 
depromote you. 
As far as this site is concerned, and the continuation of this, I do not know what you wish to do. Clearly, you 
have no interest in my continuing. And, I am not sure if you want to continue the project at all. If the latter, and 
you stop, eventu
