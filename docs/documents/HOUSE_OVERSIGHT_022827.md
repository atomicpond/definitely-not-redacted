Is Clinton willing to say he was not there? Btw, I've just filed a column for **USA Today** for **Monday** 
explaining how Dershowitz and Andrew allegations were picked up from unverified civil court docs, 
transferred to UK tabs, which go wild because of no libel rules on U.S. court papers, and then translated back 
here as "reported fact." Problem with Mi=story is that tabs are too invested in present story line, and 
unlikely that the **Times** or **WSJ** will want to touch it--tho, depending on who is willing to on record, they 
might. There is another politico reporter I know who might do it, again, if the on-the-record sources are 
public people. Or, I will use it for **New York Magazine**, but that won't be until Feb. Can you still talk 
**tomorrow**? When works? Woody and Soon-Yi coming for dinner tonight. m
