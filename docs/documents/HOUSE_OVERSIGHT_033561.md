Why Palm Beach, **Florida** Is The 'New **Greenwich**' For Wall Streeters 
JACQUELINE DETWILER, DUJOUR

The Palm Beach finance crowd can paddleboard whenever they please. 
Behind a semicircular brick drive and a lawn as manicured as a putting green sits a 30,000-square-foot 
masterpiece of Italian Renaissance architecture called Casa Nana. 
John Porter, a **Real Estate** associate for Corcoran who oversees some of the largest sales in Palm Beach 
**County**, **Florida**, points out the spiral staircase, built by famed 1920s architect Addison Mizner for the 
founder of the National Tea Company. "This home went for $30.2 million in **2003**; today that sum wouldn't 
be in the top 25 highest prices" of houses for sale in this area, Porter says. "Palm Beach **Real Estate** 
has gone from nothing going on to nothing left to sell." 
Porter is giving me a tour of the so-called Billionaire's Row, a stretch of South Ocean Boulevard on the 
island of Palm Beach that is bordered by some of the highest hedges I've ever seen. Through gaps in the 
greenery appear stone fountains, elephant statues, pools the size of tennis complexes (next to actual 
tennis complexes), and more clay roofs than one could count. It's a monumental display of wealth, and it 
is rapidly expanding, not just here but in **Delray Beach**, **Jupiter**, Palm Beach Gardens and **Boca Raton**, as 
money pours out of the Northeast (and in some cases, from as far as **London** and **Singapore**) and into this 
already wealthy section of southeast **Florida**. Approximately 70 hedge and private equity funds are now 
headquartered here, many of which have set up shop in **the last two years**, jacking up home prices and 
spurring a countywide initiative to become, as some have said, "the new **Greenwich**." 
For hedge fund managers who might normally be inclined toward Westchester or **Connecticut**, the allure of 
**South **Florida**** is as plain as grits on toast. The homes are sprawling; the Intracoastal Waterway is a 
yachter's paradise. It has a glittering social scene. During high season—October through March—there 
might be several fundraisers on any given night. Perhaps the key factor, however: **In **Florida****, there are 
no individual income taxes, no estate taxes and no capital gains taxes. A hedge fund manager reporting $1 
million in income can expect to pay only the federal government, whereas his counterpart living in 
**Connecticut** pays that plus an extra $67,000. And if the poor schmuck were still in **New York City**? He'd 
better be ready to fork over $104,300. 
As for why all of this is happening now, when **Florida** has long been a sunny tax haven, so to speak, 
financiers point to the upcoming application of Section 457A of **the Internal Revenue Code**. Before 457A 
was enacted, certain fees and related earnings could grow tax deferred in offshore accounts for up to ten 
years. But now, according to the section, hedge fund managers will need to funnel all of the fees that 
were deferred before **2009** and their related earnings back into the U.S. by 2017. If a manager lives in

**Florida** when this happens, he's much less likely to pay exorbitant state taxes on the whole amount. If he 
still lived in **New York City**? Fuggedaboudit. 
It's the job of Kelly Smallridge, president and CEO of the Palm Beach **Business Development** Board, to 
ensure that hedge fund and private equity managers are informed of these benefits, in the hopes that 
they, and their firms, will become Palm Beach **County**'s newest residents. She's developed a red-carpet 
tour that goes beyond looking at office space and **Real Estate** to include meeting headmasters at private 
schools, the school-district superintendent and the mayor and speaking with the governor's staff and CEOs 
who have moved their operations here. Plus, of course, a few nights on the town. 
In **the winter**, when the well-to-do from all over the Northeast visit **Florida** for charity balls, the board 
hosts dinners and parties for prospective relocators and local captains of industry. **last year**, 
Smallridge and company sponsored a soiree aboard a $70 million yacht that featured Veuve Clicquot, caviar 
and live jazz. Guests—who included the CEOs of a national IT company, a major finance company and a land 
developer, venture capitalists, hedge fund managers and the creator of ****Goldman Sachs****' prime brokerage 
division—took private tours with the captain of the yacht. 
Smallridge is also working with former hedge fund **CIO** Dr. Rainford Knight to develop a club for local 
investment managers called SocialAlpha that encourages bankers in Palm Beach Coun
