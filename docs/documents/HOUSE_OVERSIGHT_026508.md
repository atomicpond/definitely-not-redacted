I believe there are, but don't know how careful they are. I will try to get you references.

Yes, we can expect more extremists to run under **RCV**. But also more centrists (e.g., **Bloomberg**). Since the 
centrists are closer to the median voter, they will defeat the extremists. 
The evidence I have seen suggests that **RCV** increases turn-out. [But it's important that voters be given the 
choice to rank as many or few candidates as they like, so that a voter always has the option of voting for a 
single candidate (in effect, he would be ranking all other candidates as tied for second). In practice, most voters 
choose to rank two or three candidates, but a significant fraction just rank one] 
In fact the increase in the diversity of candidates under **RCV** is related to turn-out. If **RCV** had been used in 
**2016**, **Bernie** Sanders could have run as an independent in the general election without fear of guaranteeing a 
**Trump** victory. Many of the **Bernie** supporters who stayed home on **election day** might then have voted---and 
presumably would have ranked **CLINTON** second. This would have given lier a victory over **Trump** in **Michigan**, 
**Wisconsin**, and **Pennsylvania** (and possibly elsewhere).

I get that formal argument 
What about aspects not quite in model. 
More folk will run from extremes if they can attract more First run votes. Candidates can position a bit. 
Separately I pitched this to someone **today**. 
He said he had heard that because of its greater complexity African American and lower income turnout was 
depressed. Is there evidence on turnout impacts?

Hi **larry**, 
Thank you very much for taking the meeting **This morning**. I'm glad you found it worthwhile, and I agree with 
you that Adam Friedman's commitment to the project is impressive. 
I AM serious about working on this---it's a nice opportunity to make important practical use of some 
interesting theory. Voting rules may seem nerdy and dry, but they can make an enormous difference to actual 
politics 
The formal argument that **RCV** promotes centrism better than the current system (plurality rule) is 
straightforward. Suppose that most voters vote ideologically in the sense that the closer a candidate is to their 
own position on the left-right spectrum, the more like they are to vote for him. Then under majority rule (my 
favorite voting system)---in which voters rank candidates and the winner is the candidate who beats all other in 
pairwise comparisons----the winner will be the median voter's favorite candidate-----in other words, the most 
centrist candidate gets elected (this assumes that there are enough candidates running so that there is one who 
is reasonably close to the median voter). Now observe that **RCV** is in between majority rule and plurality rule, 
and so will promote centrism better than plurality rule. 
Best wishes, **Eric**

It was fun and interesting. 
I admire your friends determination. 
Are you serious about working on this? 
Has anyone done a full analysis of this and polarization. 
Seems like on one hand it might encourage Ralph Nader cuz he d get more first round votes and not elect 
George bush. This might be bad.

On other hand, gore would not have to move left to take Nader vote. 
If I like centrism is it clear that this is better. 
I get that it avoids arbitrary outcomes but assume that a tea party nut is as likely to elect a dem as a lefty
