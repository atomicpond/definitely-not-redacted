## Document Text

Subject: FYI 
Importance: High 
This is what I'm now going with—what do you think? 
In **the **White **HOUSE******, the President, to general surprise, announced that he would not accompany his family to 
Mar-a-Lago over the holidays—a confounding, even alarming, turn for anyone who knew how much he valued 
a golf-and-warm-weather opportunity over any presidential business. Melania certainly had no intention of 
staying behind. Among other issues, friends suggested that she was still furious about his fireside Christmas Eve 
chat with a seven-year-old boy, during which **Trump** asked the boy if he still believed in **Santa**. "Melania didn't 
think that was funny," said one aide. **Trump** was "clearly a guy who had never dealt with a seven-year-old." 
In an empty **White **HOUSE****, **Trump**'s personal secretary, **28-year-old** Madeleine Westerhout, brought his 
papers and call sheets from the West Wing up to the residence, finding him, she told friends, in his underwear. 
And herein, suddenly, was another subplot. 
Westerhout had been the elevator girl in **Trump** Tower during the transition. The comely young woman ferrying 
dignitaries and job-seekers up to the President-elect soon became something of a meme herself Bannon recalled 
noting that **Trump** took a particular interest in her. A leering **Trump** kept repeating, "She's got a way about her," 
his signature, and creepy, stamp of approval for young women. 
Now the president was telling friends that he wasn't staying at **the **White **HOUSE****** because of the shutdown—he 
was staying because he was "banging" Madeleine. 
Shutdown bravado? Locker room talk? Or all part of a new alternative reality that only he seemed to be living 
in?"
