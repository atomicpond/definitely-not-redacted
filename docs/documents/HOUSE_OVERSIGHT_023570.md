﻿**Sunday**,May14,2017 CHINADAILY

Jorge-Tuto Quiroga
Time for a ‘Belt and Sea
Lane’ for **Latin America**
President Xi Jinping will host dozens of world leaders on
**Sunday** and **Monday** at the Belt and Road Forum for
International Cooperation, as **China**’s Belt and Road Initiative
has seized worldwide attention. Right after this
important event, the Chinese government should take advantage
of the major shifts in the **Americas**, look across the **Pacific**
and launch a parallel effort: the “Belt and Sea Lane” initiative
for **China** and **Latin America** (**Mexico**, the **Caribbean**, and Central
and **South America**).
Three recent seismic changes have dramatically affected Latin
America. First, the economic links that **China** has developed
over **the past 13 years** with **South America**. Second, the end of
populism in this region. Third, the election of Donald Trump as
president of **the United States**, which will severely damage economic
integration in the **Americas**, as shown by the recent
demise of the US-led Trans-**Pacific**-Partnership agreement. Let
us broadly review these three waves to understand the opportunity
for **China**.
**South America** swayed from the “lost half decade” of 1998-
2003, to the “golden decade” of 2004-14, and this change happened
mainly because of **China**. South American nations are
rich in minerals, energy and food, which **China** started buying at
growing prices and in ever increasing volumes. **China** is the
main purchaser and price driver for commodities; whether it is
copper from **Chile**, soybeans from **Argentina** or Paraguay, iron
ore and grains from **Brazil**, gold from **Peru**, beef from **Uruguay**,
tin from **Bolivia**, oil from **Venezuela** and **Ecuador**, or coal from
**Colombia**.
This economic link became crystal clear in the US financial
crisis of 2008 that slowed down the economies of **Mexico**, Central
America and the **Caribbean** (CAC), which all depend heavily
on exports to the US market and remittances from there, but
**South America** kept growing so long as **China** kept growing. The
dividing line became clear: in **Latin America**, south of the **Panama**
Canal the economic driver is **China**, north of the **Panama**
Canal it still is the US.
**China** has become the main buyer of South American commodities,
a more important lender and an active investor. The
challenge remains to have **China** become a full blown, long-term
development partner for **South America**.
The Chinese influence in **Mexico**-CAC is different. Here **China**
is viewed as a competitor for access to the US market with manufactured
goods (**Mexico**) and textiles (CAC), as well a price hiker
for food products, and fuel that CAC needs to import. So the
Chinese economic influence is dominant in **South America**. The
US has been the prevailing influence in **Mexico** and CAC, until
Trump was elected. The future for **Mexico** and CAC is now
uncertain.
With sky-high commodity prices, **South America** was governed
according to the Hugo Chavez project in **Venezuela**, the
Workers Party (PT) in **Brazil**, the Kirchner power couple in
**Argentina**, and other like-minded projects in the region. South
American coffers were filled by Chinese purchases of oil, grains
and minerals, as populist regimes reigned over **South America**.
There was a tendency to nationalize companies, spend freely, set
low unsustainable consumer prices, close off free trade and not
be very friendly to foreign investment in general.
With the commodity price decline since **2014** (especially oil
prices) and voters fed up with and tired of corruption and abuses
of populist regimes, the tide turned. More countries now have
market-friendly governments. The end of populism in South
America bodes well for **China**, as the current governments are
more open to Chinese investment, more open to trade and can
assure a better structural framework to collaborate with **China**.
For the first time in its history, the US has elected a president
who combines a protectionist trade position with an anti-migration
policy. Trump has particularly targeted **Mexico**, promising
to deport 11 million people, to build a wall by seizing remittances
sent from the US, to hike duties for manufactured goods and
abrogate the North American Free **Trade Agreement**. This is
very worrisome for **Mexico**, but it also affects many countries in
**Latin America** that have citizens sending remittances from the
US. The trade disruption will eventually affect all CAC countries,
as well as **Chile**, **Colombia** and **Peru**, that all have similar free
trade treaties with the US.
**South America** swayed to the “golden
decade” of 2004-14, and this change
happened mainly because of **China**.
Taking into account the economic interdependence between
**China** and **South America**, the end of populism in **South America**,
and the dramatic threats that the Trump administration poses
to **Mexico** and CAC, it is clear that time, circumstances and
events are providing a significant opening for **China** to propose
a full-blown partnership with **Latin America**.
The proposal should seize the opportunity of the “demise” of
the Trans-****Pacific** Partnership** agreement. **Mexico** now needs reliable
partners
