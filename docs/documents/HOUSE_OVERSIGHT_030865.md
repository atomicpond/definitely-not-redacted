**CLINTON** vs. **Trump**: A sweep by either party would likely rattle markets 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 030865 
Our **S&P** targets and sector strategy assume a balanced outcome from the US general election on Nov 8th 
that maintains the current split in power. However, if Democrats keep the Presidency and take **Senate** or 
Republicans take the Presidency and keep **Senate**, it likely brings policy uncertainty and market volatility. 
Longer-term, it will be the policies and implementation that will influence markets, which both parties, many 
individuals and circumstances will craft. This note identifies sectors, industries and stocks that we think would 
be price sensitive to an unbalanced election outcome tilted toward one party. 
Dividing issues: Taxes, trade, favored infrastructure types and monetary policy 
It's difficult to pin down specific policies from either candidate, but on several economic issues their general 
bias is clear. These issues include taxes, trade deals, favored types of infrastructure — such as green vs 
conventional energy, preference for monetary policy, and also their expressed views on industries such as 
Health Care and Energy. It is the gist of the candidate's preference on these issues that we used to identify 
sectors and stocks sensitive to a sweep. 
Big banks might outperform small banks and oil might go down on Rep sweep 
While many of our conclusions align with conventional judgment, we think we differ in that we think a Rep 
sweep could: 1) be good for some domestic oil producers, as it should permit more drilling, but negative to the 
recovery in oil and gas prices, as more supply, and thus negative for the broad Energy sector, 2) bring 
somewhat faster **Fed** hikes and a stronger dollar than otherwise, 3) the first two could lead to lower inflation 
and a flatter yield curve than otherwise would be. One could argue that **Trump** sized tax cuts and an 
infrastructure and **Defense** spending spree would steepen the curve, but we think this unlikely while 
Republicans control the **HOUSE**. If **Fed** hikes bring yield curve flattening then big banks and capital markets 
likely outperform small banks and insurance companies. Slow hikes that allow inflation to accelerate and 
steepen the curve might favor smaller banks and insurance, but this could pressure PEs at non-financials. If 
the **Fed** falls too far behind the curve, higher long-term rates could threaten the stock market, real estate and 
the overall economy.

6) Favor Metals & Mining over Chemicals & Construction Materials
