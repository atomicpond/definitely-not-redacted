﻿**XI Jinping**, **China** AND THE GLOBAL ORDER:
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF **China**’S 2018 CENTRAL
FOREIGN POLICY WORK CONFERENCE
THE HON. KEVIN RUDD
26 TH PRIME MINISTER OF **Australia**
PRESIDENT OF THE ASIA SOCIETY POLICY INSTITUTE, **New York**
AN ADDRESS TO THE LEE KUAN YEW SCHOOL OF PUBLIC POLICY
NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE
TUESDAY 26 JUNE, 2018
On 22-23 June 2018, **the Chinese **Communist Party**** concluded its Central Conference on Work
Relating to Foreign Affairs, the second since **XI Jinping** became General Secretary of the Party
and Chairman of the Central Military Commission in **November 2012**. The last one was held in
November 2014. These are not everyday affairs in the party’s deliberations on the great
questions of **China**’s unfolding global engagement.
These conferences are major, authoritative gatherings of the entire leadership, designed to
synthesise **China**’s official analysis of international trends, and assess how **China** should
anticipate and respond to them in the prosecution of its own national interests. This one, like
the last one, was presided over by **XI Jinping** and attended by all seven members of the
**Politburo** standing committee, plus ex-officio member Vice President **Wang Qishan**, together
with all other eighteen members of the regular **Politburo**, in addition to everybody who is
anybody in the entire Chinese foreign, security, military, economic, trade, finance, cyber and
intelligence community, as well as the central think tank community.
It’s a meeting that’s meant to be noticed by the entire Chinese international policy
establishment, because if there is to be any new directive concerning **China**’s place in the
world, it’s likely to be found somewhere in **XI Jinping**’s 3,000 character report to this
conference.
Of course, the entire deliberations of the conference are not made public. Three-and-a-half
**years ago**, only a selected part of it was broadcast and reported in the central media. The
same this time as well. And unlike in **Washington**, the Chinese system doesn’t leak every
twelve hours. There is, therefore, an often hazardous reading of the tea leaves in interpreting
what it all means, discerning what is new, what is new-ish, and what is not.
WHAT IS NEW?
How does the 2018 Work Conference compare with the one in 2014? The 2014 iteration
represented the formal, official funeral of **Deng Xiaoping**’s international policy dictum of the
1 of 10
previous 30 years of “hide your strength, bide your time, never take the lead”. It also heralded
the beginning of a new period of confident, independent international policy activism
by **Beijing**. In part this change reflected **XI Jinping**’s greater centralisation of political power in
the Chinese system. In part it reflected the Chinese system’s deep conclusion that American
global power was in relative decline and that **the United States** would not confront **China**
militarily if **China** sought to expand its regional military presence. In part it reflected a Chinese
institutional conclusion that **China** had finally become an indispensable global economic power
to most countries in the world, thereby enabling **China** to begin to project its economic
influence bilaterally, regionally and also multilaterally. It also was an expression of **XI Jinping**’s
personal leadership temperament, which is impatient with the incremental bureaucratism
endemic to the Chinese system, and with which the international community had become
relaxed, comfortable and thoroughly accustomed.
For those who follow these events closely and have written on the importance of this
significant departure from **China**’s traditional strategic framework dating from the 2014
conference, a number of developments since then have been illustrative of this overall change
in the style, content and direction of **China**’s international policy approach. **China** worked
overtime in 2014-16 to expand its military position in the **South **China** Sea** with a rapid program
of island reclamation. **China** took the idea of the New Silk Road and turned it into a multitrillion
dollar trade, investment, infrastructure and wider geo-political and geo-economic
initiative, engaging 73 different countries across much of Eurasia, **Africa** and beyond. **China**
signed up most of the developed world in the first large-scale non-Bretton Woods multilateral
development bank called the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), capitalised it and
launched it so that it now has a balance sheet already approaching the size of the Asian
Development Bank.
**China** has also become for the first time a multilateral diplomatic activist, launching diplomatic
initiatives of its own beyond its own immediate sphere of strategic interest here in the East
Asian hemisphere, as well as actively participating in other initiatives such as the JCPOA on
Iran, rather than declining to reach beyond its own narrowly defined core national interests
as we have often seen in the past. **China** has also developed naval bases in **Sri Lanka**, **Pakistan**
and now Djibouti (the latter with some 5,000 troops based there
