﻿Japan Economics Viewpoint
Ready for ignition
18 November 2016
Consensus underestimating GDP and inflation
We are upbeat on Japan’s outlook and think consensus is underestimating the strength
of medium-term GDP and inflation. We expect growth of 1.4% in CY2017 and 1.2% in
CY2018, well above consensus of just 0.8% growth next year. For the first time in four
years both monetary and fiscal policy are supporting growth. The combination of
modestly higher commodity prices, a weaker yen, and a tightening output gap should
drive Japan-style core inflation to 1.0% in CY2017, and 1.4% in CY2018. We expect the
BoJ to keep its rate targets unchanged for the foreseeable future as inflation moves in
the right direction.
Fiscal and monetary policy realigning
For years Japan has oscillated between loose and tight fiscal policy. Japanese
policymakers now seem to be on the same page and we see little risk of another policy
error. If anything, we see upside risks from greater fiscal stimulus via a third
supplementary budget or a relatively aggressive FY17 ordinary budget. Meanwhile, the
BoJ’s new interest-pegging regime ensures that financial conditions will become
increasingly stimulatory as inflation rises.

2017 – a year of recovering domestic demand
We think the economy is heading towards a cyclical sweet spot and see a broad-based
recovery in domestic demand. Specifically, 1) consumption is poised to rebound as the
saving rate peaks; 2) capex should accelerate in response to the improving demand
outlook, deepening supply-side constraints, and “low-for-longer” real rates; and 3)
increased efforts by policymakers to accelerate income redistribution could push up the
velocity of money at the margin, helping to reflate the economy.

Biggest risk factor: US policy uncertainty
External developments pose the greatest risk to our forecasts, chief among them US
policy uncertainty. The downside scenario for Japan is a combination of rising US
protectionism, sliding global trade, and a stronger yen, which could reduce 2017 growth
to zero. The Trump presidency may increase pressure on Japan to achieve greater
military self-reliance, boosting defense spending. There will also be greater incentives to
deepen economic and trade linkages with key regional players, such as China and Russia.

Escape from zero
The Q3 CY16 GDP print confirms our view that Japan has at last emerged from the de
facto zero-growth trap of the past few years. Growth accelerated to an aboveconsensus
2.2% q-o-q saar, after a 0.7% rise in Q2 CY16 and 2.1% rise in Q1 CY16. We
expect a moderation in Q4 CY16, but underlying growth will remain firmly in the 1.0-
1.5% range. We are currently tracking CY2016 growth of 0.7%, a modest improvement
from 0.6% in CY2015, though the switch to a new GDP standard 1 next month raises
uncertainty around our forecasts.
Upturn in exports to be sustained through Q3 CY17
The recent recovery has been driven by a fading consumption tax shock and stronger
exports. The downturn in the global industrial cycle in 2014-16 hurt Japan, but
manufacturing activity bottomed out early this year and is now modestly expanding
(Chart 2). The OECD leading indicator continues to signal a synchronized pick-up in
global growth (Chart 3). The domestic inventory cycle also points to production gains
ahead (Chart 4). For Japanese exporters, the improvement in demand has been most
visible for Europe (Chart 5). US and Chinese demand will likely follow, though the
mainland’s structural shift to services implies only a modest acceleration. We expect the
current up-cycle in global exports to be sustained through Q3 CY17 – possibly longer
depending on developments in the US (more on this later). The combination of stronger
external demand and a weaker currency should shore up business confidence, especially
among manufacturers, and lay the foundations of Japan’s recovery.
