Lunch with **DEEPAK** I: LSD, **Quantum** 
Healing, and Plato 
A skeptic and a mystic seek common ground. Part one of four. 
Posted Jun 04, 2018 
**In **March****, I attended a debate on the proposition "The more we evolve, the less we need 
God," With **Michael** Shermer and Heather Berlin for the motion and ****DEEPAK** Chopra** and 
Anoop Kumar against the motion. **the next day** I published an account titled "Do Not  
Debate ****DEEPAK** Chopra**" (subtitle: "He's not even wrong."). Soon after, Chopra reached out 
to me and invited me to lunch. **In **April**** I met him in his office at **DEEPAK** Homebase in 
**Manhattan**, we had lunch downstairs at ABC Kitchen, and returned to his office. This is a 
nearly full transcript of our two-hour conversation. 
This is part 1 of 4. Here are parts 2, and 
**Matt**: So, I'm curious why you invited me, what you wanted to talk about. 
**DEEPAK**: I read your article, "Not Even Wrong." [Laughter.] That's been my label for a long 
**Time** from a lot of people, so I thought I'd give you my perspective on what I think reality is 
and see if we can expand the conversation. 
**Matt**: So the debate, it seemed like it was ships crossing in the night. The two sides were 
talking about different things and so I think it was clear to___or everyone else had one 
conception about what the debate was going to be about: the usefulness of the idea of God as 
conceived in monotheistic religions. Whereas the two of you were___it seemed like you were 
avoiding that debate and talking about something else. 
**DEEPAK**: So let me give you a little background to that. The first **Time** we were invited to the 
debate by the organizers____I didn't know who they were___the topic was, "As we evolve do 
we need religion?" So I called the organizers and I said, "Let me rephrase that if you don't 
mind. Can we say, As we evolve do we need religious experience?' So they said "We don't 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 029509 
know what that means." I said, as I look across the religions of the world, the common 
features I see are: Number one: transcendence___as a religious experience, not the dogma, 
not the ideology, not the institution___but transcendence, going beyond subject-object split. 
Number two: the emergence of platonic values as a result of that experience, like the desire 
to know the truth, goodness, beauty, harmony, love, compassion, joy, equanimity, gratitude  
and humility, wonder, curiosity. It's very human but it gets overshadowed by everyday 
experience. And number three: a loss of the fear of death, because that happens to 
experience, not to the consciousness in which that experience occurs. I think they didn't 
understand that, honestly, so they rephrased it as "Do we need God?" So I said, "Listen, 
before I even go there, can we have a conversation?" So they were very gracious. We all got 
together with the board or whatever and we had a conversation. I said, "Honestly, God is a 
very loaded term and if by God we mean some imagined deity or some dead white male in 
the sky then it's not something that we can even address because we don't have that 
conception of God as an imagined deity." 
**Matt**: You mean that's not something you personally can address? 
**DEEPAK**: Yeah I can't address it, nor can my partner. They said, "Well if you make that clear 
up front, then it's fine, but we still want to maintain God in the title." So I was keen to have 
this conversation because **Michael** and I have been going back and forth for **30 years** now, 
and I thought, **Michael**'s come to a very good place with me personally. So we agreed to the 
title. But if you go to the **Eastern** wisdom traditions___Buddhism, Vedanta, Shaoism, all the 
**Eastern** traditions___then God is pure consciousness, period. So the debate, you're right, they 
were talking about the mythical God and we were talking about that which is inconceivable 
as consciousness but makes every concept possible. 
So I can give you a background on that because monotheistic religions are at war all the **Time** 
amongst each other, and all of the problems in the world right now are a consequence of 
that. But nobody talks about "What is a religious or spiritual experience?" Hundreds of 
millions of people across the world don't have that idea at all that the monotheistic religions 
propose. In fact, if you go deep into the teachings of Buddhism, etc., the word God is not 
mentioned. Only consciousness is mentioned. Vedanta, only consciousness is mentioned. 
And it's a very different take on consciousness. So, if you'll allow me for a moment to 
explain that. So when I was a kid, I grew up in **India** with a father who was agnostic or 
atheist, who was trained in **England** as a cardiologist. He went on to become a v
