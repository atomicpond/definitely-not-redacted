We ended **2016** with a slightly positive **quarter**, bringing net performance for **the year** to +3.84%. Consistent
with the trend seen earlier in **the year**, **2016** has been described by investors and financial media as among
the worst years for multi-manager multi-strategy firms, on both an absolute and risk-adjusted return basis.
While we consider earning +3.84% to be disappointing for our strategy on an absolute return basis, doing so
with a maximum drawdown of 1.4%, and in what was a challenging environment for low-net exposure
relative value strategies, leaves us viewing **2016** as a “good” bad year.
For a second consecutive year, the Fund generated positive net returns overall on **the days** when the S&P
500 Index was negative. The S&P had 121 losing days in **2016** (producing losses of over -66% in total) 3 and
on **those days**, we were positive approximately 55% of the time, and generated almost half of our total net
returns for **the year**. Given that we aim to be a protector of capital in markets that most managers will lose
capital, this sampling is especially gratifying. As we look forward, we remain as encouraged as ever that our
combination of unique “niche” strategies and strategies with structural edge, alongside our allocations to
low-beta alpha-generating stock pickers and quantitative portfolio managers, will deliver strong riskadjusted
returns over various market cycles.
Before going into the performance attribution for Q4 and **2016** overall, we want to re-visit a topic discussed
in our Q1 **2016** letter related to hedge fund crowding, which investors have continued to ask us about the
past several months. The question raised is typically some variation of the following: Given that Boothbay
allocates to low-net equity focused managers, who may have similar strategies to those that comprise other
multi-manager platforms, why has Boothbay been less-exposed to deleveraging and hedge fund crowding

effects, which seem to impact other multi-manager funds in a greater way?
Platform Beta
Equity market performance is a large predictor of returns for many long/short equity hedge funds, due to the
large equity beta exposure with which many funds run. 4 At Boothbay, we generally run with limited net
equity market exposure (on average 6-8% historically) and have maintained low correlation to market
indices. While the sources of our returns will generally be idiosyncratic, there is no question that the
tremendous amount of capital that has flown into the low-net multi-manager, i.e. “platform”, category, has
created an even greater risk of exposure to “Platform Beta” for some of our managers, even while avoiding
broader equity market beta.
Platform Beta is a term we have heard used to describe the overlap of long and short positions, across some
of the largest market-neutral, multi-manager hedge fund managers. While these overlapping names may be
viewed as “smart money” positioning in some sense, there is also meaningful risk associated with being in
crowded longs and shorts due to the viciousness of the cascading effects when these portfolios are being
liquidated, or re-sized quickly, as we observed in Q1 **2016**. For a variety of reasons, we believe that
Platform Beta has a true positive expectancy over time and with much less risk than other traditional factor
risks, especially ones taken on by long-only or long-biased investors. While we consider it to be an obvious
goal to avoid material exposure to all known market risk factors, we also attempt to reduce our more
difficult to measure Platform Beta exposure when possible. Despite the positive return expectation of
