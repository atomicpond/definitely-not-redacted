Subject: Markets and **DJT** 
Importance: High 
I am writing a story about how markets keep ripping ahead despite political craziness. VIX so low, etc. 
You must get a lot of this in talking to clients -- people freaking out about headlines as markets hit 
new highs. How do you spin this to them? One hedgie Trump supporter told me that Trump is the 
highest beta prez ever -- ie the highs will be high but so will be the lows. 
Question: how closely does **DJT** track market moves? I know he tweets about Dow 20,000 but how 
aware do you think he is about how market really betting big on him. Does he talk to **barrack** about 
this? Cohn?
