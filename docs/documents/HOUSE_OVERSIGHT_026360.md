> The way that Bitcoin is organized currently is that there are five core developers and around a hundred 
contributors to the core code. The five core developers are like Linus Torvalds of Linux. They decide what 
changes are made to the core code. One of the five is the lead developer, Wladimir, and one is the Chief 
Scientist, Gavin. 
> Gavin, Wladimir and Cory (an important contributing developer) were being paid out of a non-profit 
organization called the Bitcoin Foundation. **a few weeks ago**, it "blew up" when one of the board members 
declared the foundation "bankrupt". ( https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/1284-the-truth-
about-the-bitcoin-foundation/ ) Many organizations scrambled to step into the vacuum created by the 
foundation and "take control" of the developers. We moved quickly talking to all of the various stakeholders 
and the three developers decided to join the ****Media Lab****. This is a big win for us. 
> According to the **WSJ** Blog:

markets/  
>> It's official, more or less: **MIT**'s famed ****Media Lab**** has become the principal home and funding source for 
the small team of developers responsible for maintaining and improving bitcoin's core software. 
>> 
>> Gavin Andresen, who bears the title of Chief Scientist for the six-person core development team, 
announced on his blog **Wednesday** that he and two other core developers, Wladimir van der Laan and Cory 
Fields, had moved to the **MIT** ****Media Lab****'s new **Digital** Currency Initiative, ending their previous status as 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 026360 
employees of the Bitcoin Foundation. The three other core developers, who draw salaries from different 
employers, will continue in that status.

> The usually rather feisty community has been overall very supportive and I think it is because of our strong 
research focus and our neutral position. 
> 
> The initiative has strong support from faculty across campus including crypto guru Ron Rivest and former 
Chief Economist of the **IMF**, Simon Johnson as well as faculty at the ****Media Lab****, Sandy Pentland and Andy 
Lippman.

> I hired one of Megan's former colleagues from ****the **White **HOUSE********, Brian Forde who was in charge of figuring 
out Bitcoin at ****the **White **HOUSE******** and brief the POTUS on Bitcoin to run the initiative and he is doing an 
amazing job so far.

Council member Jim Pallotta is also active in this space and joined our first and very successful dinner with 
****Media Lab**** Member (sponsor) companies to kick off a special interest group for our companies.
