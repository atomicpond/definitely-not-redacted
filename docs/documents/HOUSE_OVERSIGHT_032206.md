Consult a lawyer beforehand, if possible, but be cooperative/nice at this stage. But this sounds like an internal

emerge (around noon Central). Doing great! Hope you are as well. Breakers at **Thanksgiving**. Where will

sign or agree, he was open to disciplinary action. He was concerced that an investigation will now always be 
part of his file. . he was going to meet the title nine woman **today**. does he bring a lawyer. does he record the
