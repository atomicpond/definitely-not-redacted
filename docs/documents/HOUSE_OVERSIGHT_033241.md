I'm against censorship, and that includes **Kathy** Griffin. **CNN** eats chickenshit. What she 
did is nothing compared to Trump's murderous evil. 
P.S. THIS LITERALLY REEKS WITH IRONY...THIS IS WHERE **CNN** GETS ITS 
CHICKENSHIT. A COMMERCIAL THAT THEY'RE LOSING BECAUSE OF **Kathy**: 
SQUATTY POTTY - **Kathy** GRIFFIN "FULL OF SHIT" (2017) 
(**USA**) 
09 May, 201/ By Dabitch 0 Comments 
Second week of May this **Kathy** Griffin ad rolls out digital media only, where **Kathy** tells people that they are "full of 
shit." Literally. See, **Kathy** Griffin has a potty mouth but also a selling point - the reason you'd use the squatty potty 
is to properly empty your bowels. "It's like a colonic" she explains, but without that hose up your ass. A cute blue 
turd bleeps her potty mouth but the point is still made. 
You may remember Squatty Potty's pooping unicorn video created by the Harmon Brothers in **2015**. Now **Kathy** 
Griffin is their first celebrity spokesperson. The brand's CEO and co-creator, Bobby Edwards, finds her quirky, brave 
and fearless, which makes her a good ambassador for the brand as they target women with this campaign. 
Edwards says the brand team fell in love with the "full of shit" idea from Bravery Films, "it got the biggest laughs" 
from staff. Howie Ronay, Bravery Films' founder and chief creative officer, a former FCB exec who worked on the 
**2013** viral hit "Ship My Pants" for Kmart explains: "We know a lot of people struggle with this issue, and we decided 
to take a common colloquial phrase and use it literally." Basically, this is "ship my pants II." Enough about poop, not 
all ads can be great.
