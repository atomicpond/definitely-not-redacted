## Document Text

﻿
Conflicting reports have surfaced on the possible resignation or firing of US Deputy Attorney General Rod **Rosenstein**, who oversees the **Special Counsel** investigation into **Russia**'s role in the **2016** presidential election. 
 
According to US media, **Rosenstein** was meeting with ****White House**** Chief of Staff **John Kelly** after reports surfaced that he had offered to resign in speculation of being fired. 
 
Axios, citing an unidentified source with knowledge of the matter, reported that **Rosenstein** verbally resigned to ****White House**** Chief of Staff **John Kelly**. A second source told the news outlet that **Rosenstein** is "expecting to be fired" so he plans to step down. 
 
**The Wall **Street Journal****, citing an individual familiar with the matter, reported that **Rosenstein** has not submitted his resignation.
 
**NBC News** reported that **Rosenstein** said he would not resign and ****the ****White House******** would have to fire him.
 
**Reuters** news agency, also citing a person familiar with the matter, said **Rosenstein** had not resigned and is still serving as US deputy attorney general. The news agency reported that the unnamed source confirmed that the deputy attorney general had a previously scheduled meeting at ****the ****White House******** on **Monday** and that the Axios reports were false. 
 
The reports come as Trump faces mounting pressure from the investigation by **Special Counsel** **Robert Mueller**, who is looking into **Russia**'s role in the **2016** presidential election. 
 
**Rosenstein** assumed supervision of the investigation after his boss, Attorney General **Jeff Sessions**, recused himself because of his own contacts with **Russia**'s ambassador to **Washington** while serving as a Trump campaign adviser became public. 
 
There was widespread speculation that Trump would fire **Rosenstein** after a **New York Times** report on **Friday** said in 2017 he had suggested secretly recording Trump and recruiting **Cabinet** members to invoke a constitutional amendment to remove him from the office. The newspaper said none of those proposals came to fruition. **Rosenstein** denied the report as "inaccurate and factually incorrect".
