FBI **Epstein** files say he gave info. Does it 
explain sweetheart deal?

E-gcer. 
Uma Sanghvi ****West **Palm Beach****** 
**ten years** after convicted **Palm Beach** sex offender **Jeffrey **Epstein**** escaped federal charges 
in connection with allegations that he paid dozens of teenage girls for sex, the FBI **last week** 
released what appears to be an explosive explanation for what many have long described as 
a sweetheart deal. 
"**Epstein** has also provided information to the FBI as agreed upon," agents wrote in one of 
dozens of heavily redacted, decade-old memos that were unexpectedly and inexplicably 
posted on an FBI website known as "The Vault." 
The simple declaration stunned those who have been following the tortuous and celebrity-
studded case for years. It rekindled talk that the billionaire's 2008 decision to plead guilty to 
state charges to make the federal investigation disappear was part of a cover up to protect 
**Epstein**'s high-powered friends, including **President Donald Trump**, former **President Bill  
Clinton** and **Britain**'s Prince Andrew. 
"That sentence obviously means something but I, too, am at a loss as to what it really 
means," said attorney **Brad Edwards**, who for **a decade** has been trying to unravel the 
mystery of **Epstein**'s plea deal. "If there was some cooperation I would have expected that 
we would have been told. However, nothing surprises me at this point." 
In **recent years**, federal prosecutors have offered various explanations for why they agreed to 
drop the case they were building against the 65-year-old enigmatic money manager if he 
pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges. In court papers, they have said they wanted to 
get justice for **Epstein**'s young victims but worried a jury wouldn't believe them. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 028536 
So, they have said, they negotiated a deal, allowing **Epstein** to plead guilty in **Palm Beach** 
County **Circuit Court** to one count of soliciting a minor for prostitution and another charge 
of soliciting prostitution. In exchange, federal prosecutors agreed to close their investigation. 
They have said they had no idea **Epstein** would only serve **13 months** of an **18-month** 
sentence in a vacant wing of the county stockade___a cell he was allowed to leave 16 hours 
a day, **six days** a week. 
While voicing dismay at his lax punishment, prosecutors have pointed out that the plea deal 
required **Epstein** to pay the roughly 30 young women who filed civil lawsuits against him. 
Further, they said his guilty pleas force him to register as a sex offender for the rest of his 
life, potentially protecting other girls from abuse in the future. 
However, over **the years**, they have never suggested that **Epstein** provided them any 
information in return. 
Like Edwards, two people close to the long-closed federal investigation said they were 
flummoxed by the sentence in the FBI's memo that was written in **September 2008**, roughly 
**two months** after **Epstein** pleaded guilty in state court. 
"I have never, ever heard of **Jeffrey **Epstein**** cooperating in any sense of the word," said one 
official, who requested anonymity because of the top role the person played in the 
investigation. "I am stumped. It's totally out of left field." 
Another individual with ties to the case voiced similar views. **Epstein** may have been 
required to talk to FBI agents but it's unlikely he offered anything that would incriminate 
others, said the person, who declined to be identified because of ongoing efforts to help 
**Epstein**'s victims challenge the plea deal. "I don't think he ever told the truth," the person 
said. 
A lawsuit Edwards filed against the federal government, claiming prosecutors violated the 
Victims Rights Act by not notifying **Epstein**'s victims of the pending plea deal, is still 
pending in U.S. ****District Court****. Also, awaiting trial in ****Palm Beach** County** **Circuit Court** is a 
malicious prosecution lawsuit Edwards filed against **Epstein**. Edwards claims the billionaire 
filed a frivolous lawsuit to punish Edwards for representing a handful of **Epstein**'s young 
victims. 
****West **Palm Beach****** attorney **Jack Goldberger**, who was on **Epstein**'s potent defense team, said 
he was "unable to respond" to questions about the FBI's memo. Other prominent lawyers 
who represented **Epstein**, including **New York** lawyer **Jay Lefkowitz** and retired **Harvard** law 
professor Alan Dershowitz, didn't respond to requests for comment. 
The one line was part of a brief missive dated Sept. 18, 2008, closing the case: "On 9/11/08, 
case agent advised writer that **Epstein** is currently being prosecuted by the Stat
