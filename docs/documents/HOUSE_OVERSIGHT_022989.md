**Palm Beach**

President Donald **Trump** is a shadowy, but ever-present, figure in the never-ending saga of billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.



» RELATED: The **Post**’s complete **President **Trump**** coverage



Mar-a-Lago, the commander-in-chief’s private-club-turned-southern-White-House in **Palm Beach**, was the backdrop for Epstein’s introduction to one of his dozens of teenage victims, according to court records.



In a short-lived lawsuit that **Trump** decried as “categorically false,” a **California** woman **last year** sued **Trump** and Epstein in federal court in **New York City**, claiming the two business tycoons raped her when she was **13 years old**.



And **Trump** is on a star-studded witness list for an upcoming trial in **Palm Beach** County **Circuit Court** that attorney **Jack **Scarola**** promises will be the first public airing of Epstein’s lurid lifestyle.



But, **Scarola** acknowledges, it is unlikely the president will be part of what **Scarola** promises will be a salacious trial in the fall.

Will **President **Trump**** be used as witness in sex offender Epstein case?
