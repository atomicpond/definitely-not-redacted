INTRODUCTION
In light of concerns about mass incarceration and excessive search practices by police, 1 underenforcement of criminal law is
not the first problem that springs to mind for American criminal justice. But in fact, some of the prominent contemporary
complaints about U.S. criminal justice, as well as some longstanding ones, object to underenforcement of criminal law. Two of
the most notable categories are failures to prosecute in cases of unjustified police violence, especially against nonwhite victims,
and in cases of sexual assaults. Lower-profile examples abound as well, as do historical examples.
Given the nation's history, underenforcement problems are often related to race. Insufficient law enforcement attention to
crimes in minority neighborhoods, for example, has been criticized as depriving African American victims and communities of
their fair share of government protection from criminal harm. 2 In earlier eras, law enforcement inattention to, or wholesale
neglect [*845] of, white offenders' victimization of black victims - in lynchings, attacks on civil right activists, sexual assaults,
and other contexts - was often patent. 3 But the problem of unjustified underenforcement is not confined to these contexts, nor
to **the **United States****. Failures to prosecute arise from a fundamental structural challenge faced by all criminal justice systems:
how to ensure unbiased, evenhanded enforcement practices - safeguards in favor of justified enforcement. This challenge gets
less attention than criminal procedure's central preoccupation of guarding against excessive or groundless criminal charges.
Concern about misuse of the state's prosecution authority rightly motivates much in criminal procedure, from search and
seizure rules 4 and judicial review of arrests 5 to evidence disclosure duties, 6 the right to counsel, 7 and standards of proof. 8

Structural responses to the state declining to use its enforcement authority are much fewer and less prominent. At least in
common law countries, enforcement decisions are the province of police and prosecutor discretion, and oversight of officials'
failures to enforce has been left almost wholly to the political process. Decisions to search, arrest, or charge face modest
judicial scrutiny on evidentiary grounds and - at the extreme margins - racial or [*846] ethnic bias. 9 Decisions not to arrest or
charge are virtually immune from judicial review or other nonpolitical oversight. 10 Like other common law jurisdictions, U.S.
justice systems have always rejected an approach long adopted in some civil law jurisdictions to prevent unjustified and
disparate nonenforcement - a rule of mandatory prosecution that restricts executive officials' discretion over arrest and charging
decisions. 11
A broader view, however, reveals that all criminal justice systems incorporate one or more strategies to address
