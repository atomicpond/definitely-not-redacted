Vol in crude continues to collapse

Oil 
A relatively quiet day in Crude **today**. We hovered around unchanged for most of **the day** before selling off in the 
afternoon and testing 50$ BRE again. However, we failed to break it and rallied towards unchanged for the close, 
perhaps off the back of some index buying. Newswise, **Feb** Azeri BTC loadings will be up a whopping 11% m/o/m to 
821kbd. Interestingly, there is apparently some floating storage interest happening as well, as some major phys trading 
firms have booked long term tankers for this as long term charter rates are cheaper and thus make the economics of 
storage look good. The window was again weak with ekofisk and **Brent** offered down a bit. In other news, RTRS cites GCC 
"sources" saying that there is no chance of **OPEC** cut even though oil has dipped to 50$...Stateside, we learned **yesterday** 
that the Seaway Twin is moving 100% heavy crude. Furthermore, USGC diffs weakened again, with LLS now trading 1$ 
above WTI. In the morning WTI spreads were quite bid, but that abated towards **the end of **the day****. The arb did 
however stay bid throughout **the day**, as the fact that LLS/WTI is tight at 1$ means that there is more room BRE to 
discount vs LLS so as to place those **jan** and **Feb** overhang cargoes in the US. In politics land, the **Senate** committee voted 
13-9 to have Keystone "bypass" presidential approval. So if the **Senate** passes this bill (which it should as it has 60 co 
sponsors), Obama may have to veto it. It is not clear that the **Senate** has 67 votes needed to overturn the veto, so this 
should be interesting to follow...In products land, distillate bounced back a bit after **yesterday**'s post stats ugly showing, 
perhaps off the realization that the stats didn't add up along with the extremely cold weather giving NG a (rare) bid as 
well... 
Oil **vols**  
Another day of carnage in oil **vols** **today**. Early morning NY **vols** were down 0.4-0.5 through the curve, but a one way 
selling streak started just before the open and all the bids out there started getting hit. As an example Dec5 atm 
straddles started **the day** 1465/1505, were 1405/1450 at 9am, and were 1350/1390 later in **the day**. Within 2 hours of 
open, **vols** were down about 3 **vols** across the curve..and stayed there for most of **the day** till about 1:30pm when 
futures took a quick leg lower., prompt **vols** traded 1.5% higher than close at that time and Jun5 was up 2% from the 
lows. However, with a quick rally back **vols** started fading again and ended 1.5-2.5 lower. 
Wings got smashed again and put skew collapsed quickly. 8000 lots of $40puts in WTI Mar15 were sold on the screen, 
which is quite an impressive volume outside floor trading..

Index  
No rhyme or reason to flat price action **today**. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 030856 
Energy up, precious down, ags down, softs up, base mixed. 
Contributing to the choppy action was **day one** the SPGS and BCOM index rebalance and it was quite choppy during the 
closing bell. 
Estimated rebalance numbers are next to **today**'s performance grid. Only 4 more days to go......Sean Kemery
