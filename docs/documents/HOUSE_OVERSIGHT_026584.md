DISREGARDED ENTITIES
Disregarded Entities: To Be Or Not To Be?
Exceptions to the general rule that a disregarded entity is treated as a “tax nothing” for tax
purposes have burgeoned over **the last several years**.
Author: BRAD A. BIRMINGHAM and JAMES M. BANDOBLU, JR.
Brad A. Birmingham is a tax partner practicing in the Buffalo, **New York**, office of the
law firm Hodgson Russ LLP. James M Bandoblu, Jr. is a tax associate in the same
office.
As practitioners regularly use disregarded entities (DREs) in estate, corporate, and tax planning,
it is very important that they consider during the course of planning the growing number of
instances in which DREs are considered to exist, in whole or in part, for tax purposes.
Various provisions of the Code and regulations confer “disregarded” status on an entity. This
article briefly describes the four most common forms of DREs and their origins and outlines some
of the more significant—but often overlooked—exceptions and modifications to the general rule
that DREs are treated as “tax nothings.” Because the forms of DREs originate in different
statutory and regulatory provisions, some of the exceptions and modifications are specific to only
certain forms of DREs, others apply to all forms of DREs, and some are unique to grantor trusts.
Practitioners should be attentive to this growing class of exceptions and modifications when tax
planning for their clients.
Types of Disregarded Entities
The discussion below gives a general overview of four of the more frequently used types of DREs
and their legislative creation, but there are also other miscellaneous DREs that arise primarily
through the combined use of one DRE. For example, a partnership between a taxpayer and a
DRE that is wholly-owned by the taxpayer does not constitute a partnership for federal tax
purposes; rather, the partnership is a DRE, absent an election (under the check-the-box
regulations discussed below) to be treated as a corporation. 1
Grantor Trust Rules.
The oldest form of a disregarded entity is the grantor trust. While the development of the
grantor trust rules began in the early 1900s, **Congress** did not issue statutory guidance until
**1954**. That statutory guidance developed into what is commonly known **today** as the grantor
trust rules, which are found in Subpart E of Subchapter J of the Code. 2
In short, the primary result of the grantor trust rules is to tax the grantor of a trust on the trust's
income if the grantor retains dominion and control over the trust (or a portion of it). 3 In doing
so, the grantor trust rules treat the grantor of a trust as the “owner” of the trust (or relevant
portion thereof) for income tax purposes. 4 As a result, in calculating his or her taxable income,
the grantor includes the applicable portion of the trust's income, deductions, and credits. 5
Unlike the check-the-box rules, there are conflicting views regarding the treatment of a grantor
trust as a DRE. While the plain language of the Code's grantor trust rules appears to imply that a
wholly grantor trust (i.e., a trust that is deemed to be entirely owned by a single individual or
entity) will be disregarded for federal income tax purposes and the **IRS** has treated grantor trusts
as DREs, at least one court has not interpreted the rules in that manner. 6 Given the varying
views on the topic, each practitioner needs to determine whether his or her particular grantor
trust may be treated as a DRE. This article assumes that the grantor trust rules treat applicable
grantor trusts as DREs, and will survey the exceptions and modifications that apply given such
assumption.
Check-the-Box Rules.
Prior to **1997**, the federal tax classification of an unincorporated business entity was determined
under what were known as the “Kintner Regulations,” which analyzed four characteristics of the
entity to determine whether it more closely resembled a corporation or a partnership. 7 In **1997**,
**The ****Treasury** Department**** showed sympathy for practitioners when it simplified the classification
of unincorporated business entities by promulgating Regs. 301.7701-1, -2, and -3, now
universally known as the “check-the-box” regulations. 8
A business entity that is not automatically classified as a corporation (a “per se corporation”)
pursuant to the check-the-box regulations (an “eligible entity”) may generally elect its
classification for federal tax purposes. 9 The default classification for a domestic eligible entity is:
(1) A partnership if the entity has two or more members.
(2) “Disregarded as an entity separate from its owner” if it has a single owner. 10
The default classification for a foreign eligible entity is:
(1) A partnership if it has two or more members and at least one member does not have
limited liability.
(2) A corporation if all members have limited liability.
(3) A DRE if it has a single owner that does not have limited liab
