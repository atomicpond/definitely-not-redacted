Subject: **BILL** **CLINTON** Encouraged Donald **Trump** to Run 
Importance: High 
Funny article 
**BILL** **CLINTON** reportedly had an intriguing 
phone call with Donald **Trump** weeks 
before his campaign launch 
Rudolph W. Giuliani, Donald **Trump**, and **BILL** **CLINTON** attend the **2008** Joe Torre Safe 
at Home Foundation Golf Classic at **Trump** National Golf Club on July 14, **2008**, in 
Briarcliff Manor, **New York**. 
Former President **BILL** **CLINTON** and real-estate magnate Donald **Trump** reportedly 
had a phone conversation in **May**, **only weeks** before **Trump** launched his campaign. 
According to a new report from **the Washington **Post****, **CLINTON** called **Trump** in **May** 
and "encouraged **Trump**'s efforts" to become more influential within the **GOP**, 
according to four "**Trump** allies" and one **CLINTON** associate "familiar with the 
exchange." 
From **the Washington **Post****'s Robert Costa and Anne Gearan: 
"Four **Trump** allies and one **CLINTON** associate familiar with the exchange said that 
**CLINTON** encouraged **Trump**'s efforts to play a larger role in **the Republican Party** and 
offered his own views of the political landscape." 
"The tone of the call was informal and **CLINTON** never urged **Trump** to run, the four 
people said. Rather, they said, **CLINTON** sounded curious about **Trump**'s moves 
toward a presidential bid and told **Trump** that he was striking a chord with 
frustrated conservatives and was a rising force on the right." 
****hillary** **CLINTON****, **BILL**'s wife, is the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for 
president in **2016**. 
The **Clintons** have long had ties with the real-estate magnate. As The **Post** notes, 
****hillary** **CLINTON**** attended **Trump**'s wedding in **2005**, and the reality-television 
personality donated money to her past **Senate** campaigns, though he has also 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 030015 
donated to several of his own Republican presidential rivals. He has said 
those donations were transactional. 
The former president has spoken positively of **Trump** in the past. 
In a **2012** interview with **CNN**, **CLINTON** said he liked **Trump**, despite the real-estate 
mogul's controversial campaign to get **President **Barack Obama**** to release his birth 
certificate. 
"Donald **Trump** has been uncommonly nice to **hillary** and me. We're all New 
Yorkers," **CLINTON** said. "I like him. And I love playing golf with him." 
Aides to both **BILL** **CLINTON** and **Trump** did not comment on record to The **Post**. 
******hillary** **CLINTON****'s** campaign also didn't respond to a request for comment. 
**BILL** **CLINTON** has occasionally doled out advice to Republican presidential candidates. 
**In **2012****, **CLINTON** reportedly gave former **Massachusetts** Gov. **Mitt Romney** (R) some 
tips before his successful debate with **President **Barack Obama****, telling the governor 
how to appear in command onstage.
