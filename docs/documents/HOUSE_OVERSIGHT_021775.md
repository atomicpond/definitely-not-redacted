﻿**Palm Beach Post** Editorial #1
He was over 50. And they were girls
By Elisa Cramer
HASH(0x5fa474)
Friday, August 04, 2006
If the women whom Palm Beach police say a part-time town resident invited to his home
and paid for sex acts were, in fact, women, the solicitation charge against Jeffrey Epstein
might feel more sufficient. But, according to police records, they weren't. He was over
50. And they were girls. 14. 15.16.17-year-old girls. That should count for something -
the difference between prostitution and pedophilia.
So, it is baffling that Mr. Epstein, who was indicted last month by a grand jury on one
felony count of solicitation of prostitution, has not been charged, as Palm Beach police
strenuously urged, with unlawful sex acts with a minor and lewd and lascivious
molestation.
Conviction of crimes against minors would mean steeper penalties than the maximum
five-year prison term Mr. Epstein faces if convicted of the single count of felony
solicitation. It also would help carry a message of intolerance to perverts who prey on
girls.
Prosecutors did not pursue charges against Mr. Epstein reflecting the age of the victims
because they assumed a jury would view the girls not as victims but as promiscuous,
untrustworthy, willing participants. The presumption is offensive.
Mr. Epstein, a 53-year-old Manhattan money manager who has hired Harvard law
professor Alan Dershowitz and defense attorney **Jack Goldberger**, has denied knowing
how old the girls were. But police interviews with five alleged victims and 17 witnesses
under oath, as well as phone messages, a high school transcript and other items that
police found from searching Mr. Epstein's trash and 7,234-square-foot waterfront home,
provide evidence that he knew the girls were teenagers.
One girl couldn't show up when Mr. Epstein wanted because she had soccer. Another
time, Mr. Epstein had to wait for his "massage" session because the girl he wanted was
still in class.
Why didn't State Attorney **Barry Krischer** let a jury decide whether to believe the
teenagers - including a 16-year-old who went to Mr. Epstein's house to "work" in
December 2004 after being asked whether she needed to make money for Christmas
gifts?
Prosecutors gave greater weight to the details Mr. Dershowitz provided about the girls in
an apparent effort to assail their character. Mr. Dershowitz pointed out to prosecutors that
some of the teenagers had talked on myspace.com about marijuana and alcohol use.
The 20-year-old **Royal Palm Beach** woman who told police she recruited girls for Mr.
Epstein has a Web page on myspace.com that features one girl using the name "Pimpin'
Made EZ."
Although no charges of witness tampering have been filed, the parents of at least one of
the teenage victims complained to police of being followed and intimidated by two men.
Police determined that their vehicles were registered to two private investigators. Mr.
Goldberger denied knowing anything about it.
Police also note in their reports that the state attorney's office offered Mr. Epstein a plea
deal that would have placed him on probation for five years, allowing him ultimately to
walk away with no criminal record at all.
I asked Mr. Krischer's spokesman, Mike Edmondson, why the case was referred to a
grand jury instead of Mr. Epstein being charged and facing a trial before a jury. And
shouldn't the victims' credibility be a factor to determine whether a crime's been
committed, not whether a jury will convict? (After all, as Mr. Goldberger told The Palm
Beach Post of Mr. Epstein, "He's never denied girls came to the house.")
Especially, I asked Mr. Edmondson to explain: Why shouldn't the public look at this case
and think there are two kinds of justice - one for the wealthy and one for the rest of us?
Mr. Edmondson said he could not comment on the case because it is active, but on the
latter point, he offered, for the sake of "philosophical debate": "Whether wealth buys a
different standard of justice across the country ... the answer to that would, of course, be
yes."
But in this case, he said, "regardless of the battery of attorneys, the outcome would be the
same. Every issue that was debated in public was debated in our office before this case
went to the grand jury."
In this case, it is not the victims' credibility but the state attorney's that deserves
questioning.

Massaging the system
**Palm Beach Post** Editorial
Thursday, August 10, 2006
Palm Beach police say their 11-month investigation shows that 53-year-old part-time
town resident Jeffrey Epstein committed unlawful sex acts with and lewd and lascivious
molestation on five underage girls. Defense attorney **Jack Goldberger** claims that his
client, Jeffrey Epstein, had no idea that the untrained girls he hired for massages were
minors.
The Palm Beach Count State Attorney's Office could have let a jury decide whom to
believe. Instead, State Attorney **Barry Krischer** left the public to wonder whether the
system tilted in favor o
