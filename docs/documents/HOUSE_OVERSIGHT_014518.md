﻿TAX ALERT **2016**‐5
**December **2016****
The **2016** Election: Tax Changes Expected
INTRODUCTION
The election of Donald **Trump** as President is expected to lead to significant tax law changes. The tax changes
may come in two parts: (1) from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (**Obamacare**) and its related taxes and (2)
from comprehensive tax reform. Since Republicans will also have majorities 1 in both the **HOUSE** and **Senate**, it is
anticipated that such changes could be undertaken without the need for bipartisan support. It is likely that the
Affordable Care Act, and its taxes, could be repealed in **early **2017**** and result in an immediate tax cut for dividends,
capital gains and high‐income earners. It is more time consuming to enact comprehensive tax reform and such
efforts may not result in a tax bill until midsummer
or the fall, which could push the
effective date of broad‐based tax changes into
**2018**. Although it is not yet known exactly
what the changes will be or when they would
be effective, we are issuing this Tax Alert to
inform you of changes that are anticipated,
based on proposals made during the campaign
by both President‐elect **Trump** and the **HOUSE**
Republicans. We also discuss how these
changes may impact your planning, both
currently and in the future. When we have
more specifics, we expect to issue another Tax
Alert.
INCOME TAX
Current law. Ordinary income can be subject
to rates as high as 39.6%, and capital gain can
be subject to rates as high as 20%. In both
cases, an additional 3.8% surtax might apply.
Certain itemized deductions are “phased out”
under the so‐called “Pease limitation” when

adjusted gross income reaches certain thresholds. The Alternative Minimum Tax can result in additional tax

In **the **HOUSE** of Representatives**, a simple majority is sufficient to pass legislation. It is more complicated in the **Senate**,
where 60 votes (a super majority) are required to avoid a filibuster. Republicans have a simple majority, but not a super
majority, in the **Senate**. However, there is a budget procedure known as Reconciliation, which allows certain legislation to
be passed without filibuster. Accordingly, it would appear that Republicans could pass tax legislation in the **Senate** with just
a simple majority.
TAX ALERT **2016**‐5: THE **2016** ELECTION: TAX CHANGES EXPECTED
Proposals. Both President‐elect **Trump** and the **HOUSE** Republicans would lower the top tax rate for ordinary
income to 33%. President‐elect **Trump** would maintain the top rate on capital gains at 20%, though it might be
applicable at a lower threshold than current law. **HOUSE** Republicans would lower the top rate on capital gains to
one‐half of the highest rate imposed on ordinary income, or 16.5%. Both President‐elect **Trump** and the **HOUSE**
Republicans have proposed repealing (and replacing) the Affordable Care Act, which is the source of the current
3.8% surtax. The Affordable Care Act is also the source of the extra 0.9% surtax on high‐income earners (wages
exceeding $250,000 for couples; $200,000 for singles) and other indirect tax increases such as the reduced cap on
flexible spending accounts and tighter rules for deducting medical expenses. A repeal of the Affordable Care Act
could lead to an immediate tax cut. President‐elect **Trump** would impose a $100,000 cap on itemized deductions
($200,000 for joint filers); the **HOUSE** Republicans would eliminate itemized deductions other than charitable gifts
and mortgage interest. Both President‐elect **Trump** and the **HOUSE** Republicans would eliminate the Alternative
Minimum Tax. President‐elect **Trump**’s proposal would tax the income from “carried interests” as ordinary
income.
Planning. At its most basic, income tax planning is (i) timing income so it is recognized in a lower‐tax year, and (ii)
timing deductions so they are deducted in a higher‐tax year. However, the proposals listed above contain both
“good news” and “bad news” for **2017**, so we cannot offer a universal rule as to whether income or deductions
are better recognized in **2016**, **2017** or even **2018**. Each taxpayer needs to make an educated prediction. If there
is not a clear answer, sometimes it can make sense to recognize some income (or deductions) in **one year** and
some the next. That approach has the benefit o
