AUTHOR'S NOTE 
Late one afternoon, while taking a leisurely stroll on the Upper 
East Side of Manhattan, Tim Malloy, a friend of mine and a col-
laborator on this book, nearly ran into a trim, silver-haired 
neighbor of ours from Palm Beach. 
The man was walking down Madison Avenue, and several 
things about him were striking. For one thing, he was wearing 
slippers. Expensive, embroidered, monogrammed slippers. But 
slippers all the same. 
For another, he was accompanied by two attractive women. 
Even in Manhattan, an island that attracts beautiful women from 
all over the world, these women stood out. 
As the man half shuffled, half walked down the avenue, the 
women walked slightly behind him, as if they were attendants or 
staff. 
Tim followed, keeping a respectable distance, as the three-
some made a right onto 71st Street and headed toward an enor-
mous town house— a house that was almost a fortress—right

AUTHOR'S NOTE 
in the middle of the block. The imposing residence had a stone 
facade and a fifteen-foot-high front door that wouldn't have 
looked out of place protecting a castle. And, like our neighbor's 
slippers, the house had a monogram: raised brass letters that 
spelled out JE. 
The house and, quite possibly, the two women belonged to 
Jeffrey Epstein, a rich and powerful man who was also a regis-
tered sex offender with a strong taste for underage women. 
Not just sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds. But younger girls 
as well. 
Epstein was alleged to have abused dozens of young women, 
or, more accurately, girls. He'd settled potential lawsuits with 
some of them. He'd done a bit of prison time for his crimes. A bit 
of time. And now here he was, out in the world again. 
Accompanied by two beautiful young women. 
I had been hearing hair-raising stories about Jeffrey Epstein for a 
couple of years. Our interests could not have been more differ-
ent, but Palm Beach, where we both live, is small and tightly 
knit, and we knew some of the same people. 
Epstein's arrest had made headlines in papers all over the 
world. But in Palm Beach, it caused a scandal that continues to 
set off aftershocks and leave a bad smell. 
So I had followed Epstein's case in the media and talked 
about it over dinners with friends. I wondered why it had taken 
so long for the Palm Beach police to catch up with Epstein. And, 
once they did, why he had served so little jail time. 
Those were the obvious questions, but there were others: 
How had Epstein made his money, possibly billions? No one
