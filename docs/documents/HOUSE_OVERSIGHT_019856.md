**Supreme **Court**** REJECTS NEWMAN
REQUIREMENT OF “PECUNIARY OR
SIMILARLY VALUABLE” PERSONAL BENEFIT
FOR INSIDER TRADING LIABILITY FOR
TIPPING FAMILY AND FRIENDS
BY SAMUEL J. LIEBERMAN
**the U.S. **Supreme **Court****** gave the government a
major victory in Salman v. U.S., 1 which lowers
the standard for proving insider trading involving
tipping family or friends, and will embolden the
government to bring similar cases. Salman holds
that a gift of inside information to a family or
friend is sufficient to prove insider trading tipping
liability—even if the tipper did not receive a
valuable quid pro quo in exchange for the tip. This
significantly narrows U.S. v. Newman, in which
Client Alert
Status of the New DOL Fiduciary Rule
BY DANIEL G. VIOLA
Reprinted with permission of Hedgeweek
The Department of Labor’s (the “DOL”) new
fiduciary ruling (the “Rule”) has created strife
in the securities industry and has the potential
to significantly impact how financial advisers
and brokers will manage retirement accounts
in the future.
Currently, brokers, financial advisers, and other
finance professionals do not legally have to act
Salman will almost certainly embolden the SEC and federal
prosecutors to bring more insider trading cases, because it is
much easier for the government to prove a “gift” to a “friend”
than to prove a “pecuniary” or similar quid pro quo.
**the Second Circuit** (a lower appellate **Court**) held
that a tipper must receive “at least a potential
gain of a pecuniary or similarly valuable nature,”
(continued on page 2)
in a client’s best interest, with few exceptions,
such as those who are registered as investment
advisers with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission or in individual states. Those who
are not registered, like brokers, just have to prove
that the investment is suitable, not necessarily
the best option, for their client—no matter that
that fund might be more expensive and provide

**Supreme **Court**** Rejects Newman Requirement of “Pecuniary or Similarly Valuable” Personal
Benefit for Insider Trading Liability for Tipping Family and Friends (continued from page 1)
as a personal benefit necessary to be held liable
for insider trading. 2 Salman will almost certainly
embolden the SEC and federal prosecutors to
bring more insider trading cases, because it is
much easier for the government to prove a “gift”
to a “friend” than to prove a “pecuniary” or similar
quid pro quo.
In Salman, an investment banker at **Citigroup**
tipped his brother about certain pending healthcare
mergers involving **Citigroup** clients. The
brother traded on that information for a profit,
and also tipped his brother-in-law, Mr. Salman,
who also traded for a profit. At trial, the government
relied solely on the tippers giving a gift of
inside information to a close family member to
satisfy the “personal benefit” requirement of tipper-tippee
insider trading liability. The government
did not identify any money or other valuable quid
pro quo paid for the tip. Salman was convicted at
trial, and his conviction was upheld by the **Court**
of Appeals for **the Ninth Circuit**.

a better commission for the adviser. The Obama
administration found that conflicted advice cost
savers about $17 billion a year based on a 2015
report. To be clear, the Rule applies only to retirement
accounts like 401(k)s and individual retirement
accounts (“IRAs”), not to regular taxable
accounts. According to the Investment Company
Institute, Americans invest $7.8 trillion in IRAs
and $7 trillion in 401(k)s.
On **January 20, 2017**, the DOL issued two new
sets of Frequently Asked Questions (“FAQs”) on
the Rule. One of the sets of FAQs focuses on the
new definition of fiduciary investment advice
and the other set is geared toward retirement
investors and consumers, covering consumer
protection features of the new Rule. This is the
second of three rounds of guidance to be published
by the DOL prior to the effective date of
the new Rule.
**the Executive Branch** also issued responses to
the Rule on **January 20, 2017**. **the ****White House******

heads of the executive departments and agencies
