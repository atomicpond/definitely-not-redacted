Importance: **High 
What** nice coverage in **The **Huffington Post****. 
Living in **Europe**, I was not aware that **Trump**'s proposed cuts will be so devastating to the scientific 
community. 
You asked me if I would be in New York ****September** 18**. Did you have something in mind?

****Linda** Stone** was the person who I met with **years ago**. It was **Linda** who suggested that I contact you. 
best wishes, 
Stanley
