economy of near zero marginal cost and the prospect of nearly free goods 
and services. This catch-22 is the inherent contradiction that underlies 
capitalist theory and practice. 
Eighty years after Lange and **Keynes** made their observations, con-
temporary economists are once again peering into the contradictory work-
ings of the capitalist system, unsure of how to make the market economy 
function without self-destructing in the wake of.new technologies that are 
speeding society into a near zero marginal cost e. 
**Lawrence Summers**, U.S. secretary of the **Treasury** during President 
Bill Clinton's administration and former president of ****Harvard University****, 
and J. Bradford DeLong, a professor of economics at the University of Cal-
ifornia, **Berkeley**, revisited the capitalist dilemma in a joint paper delivered 
at the **Federal Reserve Bank** of **Kansas City**'s symposium, "Economic Pol-
icy for the Information Economy," in **August 2001**. This time, there was 
much more at stake as the new information technologies and the incipient 
Internet communication revolution were threatening to take the capitalist 
system to a near zero marginal cost reality in the coming decades.
