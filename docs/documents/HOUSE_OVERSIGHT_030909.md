Subject: Re: Statement in the Daily Beast? 
Importance: High 
Here is my response to the hundreds who are now attacking me on the web: 
I will add one remark here, as most people have not read my full set of comments, posted after the post 
appeared.. I am myself rather disappointed by the lack of skepticality of this community. As I said, I have read 
numerous reports of orgies on **Jeffrey**'s island involving me and other scientists during our meetings.. Orgies 
that never happened, I am VERY skeptical of other claims on his behavior. I am defending **Jeffrey** for 2 
reasons: (1) Based on my knowledge and experience I am skeptical of the claims in the media and of those who 
have settled claims for money... namely I don't believe the published details just like I tend to be skeptical of 
many published details on the internet.. I don't believe **Jeffrey** did what has been claimed, and unless I see hard 
evidence, I will trust my own judgement here, and (2) **Jeffrey** went to prison, and I happen to believe that 
having served time, even those who questioned his behavior should be willing to give him the benefit of the 
doubt, again until proved otherwise, that he is working hard to live a good life and do good things. I for one am 
disgusted that people eat up the salacious nonsense the read on the web and then jump to conclusions about 
things and people they do not know.. I do not jump to condemn people, especially when it concerns their sexual 
preferences. I DO NOT CONDONE sex with young girls, or young boys for that matter.. because there are real 
victims there.. Until I know all the facts however, I do not jump to conclusions, and I am sorry, having seen the 
media frenzy around **Jeffrey**, and having seen the shoddy behavior of those who have attacked him, I remain 
skeptical, and I support a man whose character I believe I know.. If you want to condemn me for that, so be it.

ok.. I just sent an additional email which moderates this.. everyone was a victim, including **Jeffrey** here.. 
and there was no happy resolution.. please add.. "probably everyone was a victim, with no happy resolution 
or consequences of these activities", after "was the victim in this case.".

Okay, thanks for this statement . . . I'll print it in full along with the article, probably **today**. I very, very 
strongly disagree with your position and hope you eventually reconsider, but I do appreciate you taking the 
time to respond.

**Jeffrey** apparently paid for massages with sex... I believe him when he told me he had no idea the girls were 
underage, and I doubt that people normally are asked for or present a driver's license under such 
circumstances... Moreover, I also believe that **Jeffrey** is an easy target for those who want to take advantage 
of him... Moreover, I can say with great honesty that **Jeffrey**'s time in prison led him to seriously examine 
his life in very positive ways and I don't believe in blanket condemnations of people. He served time for 
something that was determined was inappropriate. I honestly don't know who was the victim in this case. I 
fully expect that these masseuses knew what they were doing, and were not swayed to do anything with 
**Jeffrey** that they were not already doing. That is not to approve of the whole behavior, but lots of peopleI 
know and like have behavior I don't entirely approve of. I know it is not politically correct to say that, 
because in general this is a very sensitive issue and all other things being equal one should take the side of 
the young women. But all things are not equal in this case, from my point of view. It is a judgement call, 
and I will not turn my back on a good friend so easily.
