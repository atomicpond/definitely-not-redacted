**Middle **East**** Update

May 25-31, **2011**

 

 

**Syria**

International pressure on **Damascus** is mounting. After the US imposed sanctions on the Syrian leadership earlier in May, the EU foreign ministers agreed to impose travel bans and to freeze the assets of President **Assad** and nine other Syrian senior officials. Within **days** of the EU announcement, **Canada** invoked similar travel and economic sanctions.

 

While **Russia** blocked any reference in the G8 communiqué to the possibility of deferring the issue of **Syria** to **the UN Security Council**, the communiqué’s compromise language illustrates the international community’s increased pressure on the regime. The G8 leaders stated that they were “appalled” by the death of peaceful protesters and called on the Syrian leadership to immediately stop using force against its people or the G-8 countries would “consider taking further measures”. 

 

At the same time, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah—the leader of the Lebanese party **Hizbullah**—called on the Syrian people to give the government time to effectuate reforms, arguing that President **Assad** believes in reforming the system and is determined to implement change. The **Hizbullah** leader denied that his party has dispatched fighters to assist the Syrian regime in quelling the protest movement. Anti-**Iran** and -**Hizbullah** slogans were chanted in a number of Syrian cities in response to Nasrallah’s defense of the regime and his pictures were burned in Deir Ezzor in eastern **Syria**.

 

Syrian protesters declared **Friday** “the day of the Guardians of the Homeland”—a reference to the Syrian armed forces—in an effort to encourage the army to join the uprising. Security and military forces appear, however, to be stepping up their campaign in an attempt to end the protests. Tens of people were killed or wounded over **the weekend** and tanks have entered two suburbs of the city of Homs, Rastan, and Talbiseh. The heavy-handed repression by police and military officials may lead demonstrators to consider a recourse to arms.

 

The government is cracking down on protesters’ use of social media, but, in contrast to what occurred in **Egypt**, it has refrained from a general shut down of the internet. Security officials are forcing dissidents to turn over their **Facebook** passwords and have switched off 3G mobile networks in order to prevent the uploading of protestor videos to **YouTube**. The electricity and phone service has been cut off in neighborhoods where discontent is mounting. 

 

**Facebook** and, in particular, its “Syrian Revolution **2011**” page, has been a vital platform for activists to mobilize protests and to disseminate information. **Syria** has over 580,000 **Facebook** users. In response to government measures, protesters have created multiple **Facebook** pages under different names and have given their **Facebook** passwords to friends in case they are arrested or disappear and their comments opposing the **Assad** regime  need to be quickly removed from personal webpages.

 

Syrian activists acknowledge their debt to the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions, further improvising and improving on their tactics on a **daily** basis in an effort to avoid retribution by the regime and to sustain the protest movement. Daytime demonstrations have moved to the evening in order to make it more difficult for security forces to identify individual protesters and to single them out for arrest. After dark, protesters can disperse to unlit alleyways to escape arrest—a tactic Syrian activists call “tayyara” or flying.

 

**Yemen**

The authority of President **Saleh**’s government continues to erode rapidly and **Yemen** appears to be edging closer towards a civil war. Tribal fighters in the capital of Sanaa, have gained control of key ministries, including **the Interior Ministry**. Brigades from the Republican Guard—the President’s main forces—have surrendered to tribal fighters **East** and **West** of the capital who have succeeded in blocking their deployment to Sanaa.

 

According to well-informed sources, the Vice President, the Prime Minister, and the Speaker of the Yemeni Consultative Council have tried to convince President **Saleh** to sign the agreement mediated by **the **Gulf** Cooperation Council** (GCC) in an effort to avoid civil conflict. Disregarding their advice, President **Saleh** remains convinced that he will be able to stem the uprising and maintain his control of the government.

 

On **Sunday** night, President **Saleh** ordered units of the Republican Guard and Central Security—commanded by his son and a nephew, respectively—to clear the protestors from Liberty Square in the city of Taizs, where they have been camping for **more than four months**. Dozens of civilians were killed and approximately 1000 were wounded. Reports indicate that President **Saleh** is preparing to attack protesters in other cities and towns.
