We have had some positive feedback from the article. Now the issue certainly has more visibility in **Washington**. Bob is 
in the process of setting up the meeting with Tom at the **State** Dept regarding the Human Rights Report for **2016**. Will 
send more as we get more details.

We are working on getting the following article placed in the **Hill** or the **Politico** within **the next week**. As of now it looks 
like former Chairman of Armed Services, Congressman Ron Dellums, will be the author. Please keep highly 
confidential. Will keep you posted on if, when and where it gets published. Once it is published we can all circulate it 
highly. We believe that this article sets the tone for the advocacy we will be doing and having someone very prominent 
like Congressman Dellums will also be a great way to launch this campaign. 
Congressman Ronald Dellums is a thirteen term Member of the U.S. **HOUSE** of Representatives (D-CA) who 
served from 1971-1998. He also served as the 48th Mayor of **Oakland** from 2007-2011. Dellums served as the 
Chairman of **the ****HOUSE** Armed Services** Committee** and the ****HOUSE** Committee** on **the District of Columbia**. He 
also served on the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Post Office and Civil Service Committee, the Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence and co-founded the Congressional Black Caucus. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 026836 
**Senegal**'s Democratic Backslide 
2015 was a banner year for democracy in **Africa**. **Nigeria**, the largest country on the continent, had a 
democratic election, and even more impressively, had its first ever peaceful transition of power when sitting 
President Goodluck **Jonathan** transferred power to Muhammadu Buhari. Former President **Jonathan** conceded 
and famously declared, "Nobody's ambition is worth the blood of any Nigerian." My last piece for The **Hill** 
was titled, 'Will Guinea's experiment in democracy succeed?" It is with great joy that I can report that it 
did! Guinea's first democratically elected President, Alpha Conde, won his reelection campaign in a peaceful 
election that was internationally monitored in which the Guinean electorate reaffirmed its commitment to a 
democracy. 
Despite these victories for democracy in a continent in which I dedicated a great deal of my life's work, I am 
deeply troubled by developments over the last few weeks. **earlier **this week**** **Uganda** President Yoweri 
Museveni extended his thirty year rule and "won" his fifth consecutive election which international observers 
said was marred with intimidation and impropriety. Shortly after the election Museveni, who scrapped 
constitutional term limits **a decade ago**, had his political rival, Kizza Besigye arrested and detained for 
protesting the election results. Of course we have come to expect these actions from Museveni in 
**Uganda**. What I am even most troubled by is what is taking place in **Senegal**, which was once the pillar of 
democracy in Afri
