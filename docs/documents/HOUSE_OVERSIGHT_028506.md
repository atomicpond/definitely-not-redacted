Subject: US Saudi Arms deal but Note **Blackstone** Infrastructure Fund with **SAMA** 
Terje, the attached article appeared in todays FT, I have removed the defence part related to the US$110bn arms 
deal but highlighted the separate deal done with **Blackstone** to establish a fund for US infrastructure this is akin 
/ precedent to what we seek to achieve with **SAMA** focused on global investment fund in Airport Infrastructure 
— Best Richard. 
US **President Donald Trump** began his first foreign trip with a stop in ****Saudi Arabia****, where a $nobn 
arms package was announced that **the **White **HOUSE****** hopes will help ****Saudi Arabia**** and other **Gulf** states 
combat terrorism in the region and ward off threats from **Iran**. 
US defence companies lifted by Saudi deals 
**Lockheed Martin** and **Boeing** stand out after ****Saudi Arabia**** signs a 
flurry of deals 
Separately, the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund has also  
announceo a large investment in US infrastructure 
through a new **Blackstone** fund. The sovereign Public 
Investment Fund intends to invest $2obn into 
**Blackstone**'s new vehicle, with a further $2obn coming 
from other investors. The group's stock price rose 6.7 per 
cent to $31.88.
