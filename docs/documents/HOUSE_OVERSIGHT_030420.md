"I've got a story idea for you. The rebuilding of **Indonesia**. Or **New Orleans**. Or both. Go there. I've just been. You will never 
think the same way about anything again." 
So spoke not Bill or **Melinda Gates**, but ******Ghislaine**** ****Maxwell******, the **48-year-old** woman being written up everywhere at the moment 
as the alleged "procurer" of young women for billionaire ****Jeffrey** **Epstein****. 
**Epstein**, 57, is the financier who spent **a year** in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of another 
investigation because various women, now in **their twenties and thirties**, have come forward with allegations that he molested 
them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British newspapers, which have zeroed in on **Epstein**'s 
friendship with **Prince Andrew**, who has recently tried to publicly disassociate himself from his old pal. 
I wrote a piece for **Vanity Fair** in 2003 called "The Talented Mr. **Epstein**." It was largely a business piece that focused on his 
mysterious exit from **Bear Stearns** in 1981, his close relationships with **Jimmy Cayne**, **Les Wexner**, the chairman of Limited 
Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude Hoffenberg, who is currently serving a **20-year**-jail 
sentence for bilking investors in **Towers Financial** out of $450 million. 
The piece alluded to **Epstein**'s great friendship with ****Maxwell****, and how she introduced him to young women with whom he had 
sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn't really go there, focusing instead on the issue that remains a mystery—how 
**Jeffrey** made his money, and how ****Ghislaine**** made hers. 
This is not to say I didn't hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I concentrated on the intriguing 
financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same ones, different ones. And their stories are bone-
chilling. Journalists from **England** have phoned—and, in one case, flown—to ask me about **Epstein** and ****Maxwell****. Who is he? 
And the British, especially, want to know: Who is she? At this point, I am so bored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all, 
my 2003 **Vanity Fairstory** that really brought him into the limelight—that I have decided to write about this myself. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 030420 
Bizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know **Jeffrey** and ****Ghislaine**** far better after my piece than before it. I kept running into both of 
them, separately, at parties. **Jeffrey** is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of young women with him who stand two feet 
behind him, as if serving a monarch. "Do they speak?" I remember asking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He 
laughed. "Not like you, **Vicky**," was his riposte. 
I remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn't studied math 
since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at home via messenger. It was a 
book: "Math for idiots." 
So he is not without humor, even though he doesn't drink or smoke, and hates restaurants. 
"**Jeffrey** knows a good deal about most subjects," newspaper publisher **Mort Zuckerman** told me **last week**. He was certainly 
preaching to the converted. The truth is, **Epstein** does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few moments in his company and 
you know this to be true. 
When I saw pictures of **Prince Andrew** walking in **Central Park** with **Jeffrey**, my immediate thought was that "Andy"—as **Jeffrey** 
calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his strange title is. Because if one thing's 
for sure: When it comes to international business, **Jeffrey** knows what he's talking about far more than "Andy" does. Which is 
why **Leon Black**, **Mort Zuckerman** and a few other financiers hang out with him. 
And ****Ghislaine****?
