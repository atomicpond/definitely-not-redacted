Message from
the Director
I
am pleased to present the fourth **annual** report from the **Office** of
Government Information Services (OGIS) detailing our fiscal year (FY)
**2013** activities. We are extremely proud of all that OGIS has accomplished
in our four years of operation. We have put **Congress**’s novel idea—
applying Alternative Dispute Resolution techniques to an often highly
adversarial process—into action. We have assisted thousands of Freedom
of Information Act (**FOIA**) requesters from across the country and around
the globe, along with dozens of agencies, in resolving disputes, some of
which would have otherwise led to costly litigation. We have worked with
agencies to better fulfill their responsibility to provide good customer
service, resolve disputes with **FOIA** requesters, and promote compliance
with **FOIA**.
Demand for OGIS’s services is high. Requests for assistance in resolving
**FOIA** disputes greeted me the morning the **Office** opened **four years ago**. In
FY **2013**, the number of incoming cases jumped 40 percent from the previous
year to more than 500 cases; at the same time, we closed nearly 500 cases—
also a 40-percent increase from **the previous year**—and handled hundreds of
inquiries by telephone and email.
Much work remains for our innovative program. While we have carried out
**Congress**’s mandate to review **Federal** agency **FOIA** policies, procedures, and
compliance in several ways, we would like to implement a more robust review
program. OGIS’s mission is broad, and like many government programs, we
2
must make difficult choices about how we carry out our mandate as demand
for our services increases.
We look forward to building on our first four years and continuing our
service of helping anyone—requester or agency—with any part of the **FOIA**
process and improving the administration of **FOIA**.
You may notice that this report is slimmer than our first three reports. Please
visit our blog, The **FOIA** Ombudsman: Information and Advice, where you’ll
find many of the items we included in past reports.
Sincerely,
Miriam Nisbet

Resolving
Disputes
OGIS’s mediation services to resolve Freedom of Information Act
(**FOIA**) disputes, as mandated by **Congress**, comprised the bulk
of OGIS’s work in FY **2013**, as in the previous three years. Requests for
assistance awaited Director Nisbet when she opened the **Office**, and early
on, OGIS decided that demand for mediation services dictated that the
**Office** commit to assisting
anyone asking for help with
**FOIA**.
From the start, OGIS has
served as a confidential and
informal information resource,
communications
channel,
complaint handler, and dispute
resolver. OGIS strives to be an
advocate not for the requester or
the agency, but for an effective
**FOIA** process that works as
intended.
In its first three years, OGIS
handled an average of roughly
350 cases a year. The number
of requesters seeking OGIS
OGIS’s caseload soared above 500 for the
first time in FY **2013**. (NARA Identifier
6443896)

assistance swelled in FY **2013**, the **Office**’s fourth year. OGIS opened 508 cases, a
40-percent increase from FY 2012 when OGIS opened 361 cases. OGIS also handled
more than 230 inquiries—telephone calls and emails yielding quick responses that
did not require cases be opened—in FY **2013**. OGIS closed 497 cases in FY **2013**, a
40-percent increase from FY 2012 when the **Office** closed 354 cases.
OGIS cases involve issues that arise at various points in the **FOIA** process.
OGIS encourages requesters and agencies to communicate
through whatever means work best for them. (NARA Identifier
6479577)
In some cases, requesters attempt to learn
a request’s estimated date of completion as
required by **FOIA**, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(7)(B)
(ii), but are not able to obtain it from an
agency. In other cases, requesters disagree
with an agency’s application of **FOIA**
exemptions or an agency’s decision with
regard to **FOIA** fees. In all cases, there
is some issue that benefits from OGISfacilitated
communication between the
requester and the agency.
OGIS’s mediation services also include
providing Dispute Resolution Skills
training to agency **FOIA** professionals.
The goal of training is not to turn agency
