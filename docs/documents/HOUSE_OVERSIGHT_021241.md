HD: Wall Street, Take Two 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021241 
DEK: In the upcoming sequel to Oliver Stone's groundbreaking film, Gordon Gekko gets out of jail and back to business. Peggy 
Siegal takes us behind the scenes where she got herself on camera along with a few of her famous friends. Nice work if you can get 
it. 
In 1987, right after director Oliver Stone won **the **Academy Award**** for "Platoon," he immediately turned to a domestic arena 
and began working on "Wall Street" in **New York City** where his father had been a stockbroker. Although the film was widely seen 
as a scathing critique of the culture of Wall Street, Stone has said that part of the film is a defense of capitalism, his father's vision of 
finance (as seen through the Hal Holbrook character) and an homage to his father. 
At the time Oliver was also fascinated with the connection between the psyche of Latino Miami drug dealers from his earlier 
"Scarface" script and the American-born 28- to **35-year-old**, white collar stockbrokers. Both groups had an animalistic need to obtain 
big and fast money. They shared an obsession with corruption and greed. 
Oliver sent his actors to ****Bear Stearns**** for research, including then-newcomer **Charlie Sheen**, who played Bud Fox, a kid from 
nowhere. When he learns to cold call, and lands one big client, Gordon Gekko, Fox is thrust into the fast lane with a rock star 
financial mentor who teaches him corruption. 
Oliver needed an old-fashioned villain to create drama, and he cast **Michael Douglas** as Gekko against type. Michael was not 
known as a heavy at the time, but as a charming, handsome, sensitive leading man. Oliver also saw the anger, confidence, 
salesmanship and style that Michael brought to the role. Michael's Gekko looked a bit like Laker's coach Pat Riley with his slicked 
back hair and well-cut suits, and it became Michael's most important role, winning him **the **Academy Award**** for the villain no one 
could ever forget. 
When Gekko delivers his speech, "Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works," cinematic history was 
made. 
"Wall Street" was set in 1985, a time before ten financial news networks broadcasting 24/7 existed. The entire financial services 
industry was largely unknown and Oliver Stone nailed it. 
**four years ago**, Wall Street's producer **Ed **Pressman**** decided it was time for a sequel and met with Fox Film Entertainment co-
chairmen Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos. **Michael Douglas** was immediately on-board pending script approval. Steven Schiff 
wrote the first script before the global economic crash of 2008 rendered it obsolete. 
Alan Loeb was brought in for a rewrite. **Pressman** asked me to meet Loeb at the Carlyle Hotel to explain the social rhythms of 
**New York's** financial high society. Whereas Gekko 's character was modeled after '70s junk bond kings (**Michael Milken**) and '80s 
mergers and acquisitions killers (**Henry Kravis**), Loeb bases the new villain on hedge fund billionaires like John Paulson and Mike 
Novogratz, geniuses who have created stratospheric wealth beyond Gordon Gekko 's wildest dreams. When Oliver Stone agreed to 
direct, he rewrote a port
