Respected and acclaimed as rock stars in the arcane universe of life
sciences, global scientists converged in **Stockholm** in late August this
**year** for the **annual** Swedish American Life Science Summit (SALSS)
meeting, where they unveiled and dissected revolutionary health care
platforms. Among them are the use of robotics in surgery, how
nanotechnology may make us "forever young,” applications of space
technology in life sciences, and the “Moonshot” cancer program
initiated by former Vice President **Joseph Biden**.
Without doubt, global investors are closely watching organizations
such as SALSS to discover the latest innovations and discoveries in life

science. This area is replete with groups deeply involved in original
research. So one of the major topics discussed at the SALSS conference
was “impact investing,” or why investors should pay closer attention to investing in life science.
“In **today**’s world with an aging population, we observe a higher occurrence of chronic diseases, such as cancer and
autoimmune conditions,” noted Hans Straberg, chairman of Atlas Copco, and former CEO of Electrolux. “So Big Pharma and
the industry are looking beyond the chemical and biologically derived molecules.” And as universities and small startups have
taken the lead in R&D investments, "Big Pharma is very much dependent on collaborating with them, or acquiring their
technologies,” he argued.
**today** Big Pharma has a “really strong position” in life sciences and are Looking for "new blockbusters to replace current stars
that are coming off-patent," he said. The current focus, added Straberg, is “very much on finding cures for diseases like
cancer, autoimmunity, allergy and infection,” and employing various new technologies.
So new ideas to address a variety of serious medical issues have always attracted medical luminaries to SALSS, and at this
**year**’s conference, the speakers included Biden Cancer Initiative Executive Director Gregory Simon, Nobel Foundation
chairman Dr. Carl Henrik Heldin, European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries Director-General Richard Bergstrom,
and Microsoft Healthcare's chief development officer Mathias Ekman.
Also among the expert speakers were **Pfizer** executive vice president and chief of the company’s worldwide research
development Dr. Michael Dolsten, Secretary-General of the Royal Swedish Academy Life Sciences' Dr. Goran Hansson,
Google Healthcare and Cloud business manager Ebba Kraemer, China Kindstar Global Diagnostics CEO Shiang Huang,
AVRA Medical Robotics founder and CEO Alen **York**, expert in diabetes-related issues and CEO of Lyfebulb Dr. Karin
Hehenberger, and the founder and former chairman of Human Genome Sciences and currently chairman of ACCESS Health
International **Dr. William** A. Haseltine.

“Throughout **the years**, Swedish research and innovation have led the way to disruptive changes within medicine, which has
resulted in an immense impact on people’s lives and great value for society,” argued Dr. Goran K. Hansson, secretary general
of The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. **today**, “we see an increased interest of foreign capital in Swedish Life Science,
which the Swedish government embraces,” he said. Swedish Life Science players, he added, "look for international expansion

conference theme of "Moonshot & Beyond," one of the speakers was Swedish astronaut Dr. Christer Fuglesang, who talked
