WITH his panoramic view of world affairs sharper than ever, **Paul Keating** blames the current global crisis 
on blunders by European and US leaders and warns that Australia must rediscover the keys to national 
success. 
Interviewed in his Sydney office, furnished in a style he calls "the last gasp of revolutionary classicism", Keating's 
new 600-plus page book sits atop his desk, an insight into his intellectual, aesthetic and political obsessions. 
What has Keating been doing since he left office in 1996? He has been travelling, speaking and analysing the world 
and Australia with undiminished intensity suggesting a man operating as prime minister-in-exile. 
His idea of leadership is more philosophical than ever, more distant from Bob Hawke or **John Howard**. His focus is 
the synthesis between beauty and reason and his book encompasses China's currency, the world malaise, Mahler's 
Symphony No2 and breaking the republic with the Queen. 
DURING THE INTERVIEW KEATING TALKS, AS NEVER BEFORE, ABOUT HIS LEADERSHIP CONCEPT. 
BUT HE IS DOING SOMETHING ELSE: EXPLAINING HIMSELF TO A STILL PUZZLED 
NATION.RECOMMENDED COVERAGE

"The great changes in civilisation and society have been wrought by deeply held beliefs and passion rather than by 
a process of rational deduction," Keating tells me. In retirement, his political inspiration comes from music and 
beauty, not opinion polls. 
There are signs he has mellowed. While ruthless with his judgments Keating is keen to support a struggling Labor 
Party while addressing the source of its strategic demise. 
"The failure of the Rudd and Gillard administrations is the lack of an over-arching story, the lack of a compelling 
story," he says when interviewed last week. 
"I'm happy that Labor took us through this dreadful financial crisis so competently. But they are not in the business 
of teaching. And governments, to succeed with change, must be in the business of educating the community. 
"Our Labor governments have failed to conceptualise the changes. We need a framework. 
"What is the framework? It is 'Australia in Transition' strategically and economically. That's the story we have to 
present. 
"I think the Australian people are very conscientious. During **the 1980s and 1990s** we proved they will respond 
conscientiously to necessary reforms. They mightn't like them but they'll accept them. But reforms have to be 
presented in a digestible format. 
"I know that in the age of the internet, opinion and perpetual static it is difficult to get the message over. I accept 
that. But the big messages have their own momentum. If we get the story of transition right then other things will find 
their place. 
"Our problem is what I call shooting-star policies. We have a policy on carbon pricing, on minerals, on boatpeople, 
but they are not connected up to the big picture about Australia's direction and its transition." 
Pressed on whether he thinks **the **Australian Labor Party**** is in permanent decline, Keating defends Labor, insists it 
doesn't have to decline but highlights the problem. "Labor must recognise what it has created," he says, invoking the 
**Hawke-Keating** era. "It has a created a new society and it has to be the party of the new society. 
"It can't be the party of part of the old society. Labor must be the party of those people who gained from the pro-
market growth economy that we created. Labor must be open to the influences of this middle class, to people on 
higher incomes. And I don't think it is." 
It is, perhaps, the clearest statement of Labor's problem. The party, in an act of strategic folly, abandoned the path 
of its previous success. It turned inwards on itself, away from the community. 
"At the operating level it's become the party of insiders," Keating says. "The problem is that members get too caught 
up in the gift of faction managers and they get caught up in the false construct of popularity, the false god." 
Fixated by the nature of political leadership, Keating's book **After Words** shouts out: "The great curse of modern 
political life is incrementalism." 
Leaning across the table he says to me that briefing notes and economic texts aren't enough: the leader must locate 
his own source of higher command and inner belief. He laments the efforts of US **President **Barak Obama**** and 
German
