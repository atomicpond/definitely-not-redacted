Re: **Edwards**, Bradley adv. **Epstein** 
Our File No.: 291874 
**Dear Mr**. Capp: 
Despite the total absence of competent evidence to demonstrate that **Bradley **Edwards**** 
participated in any fraud against **Jeffrey **Epstein****, and in the face of uncontrovertible 
evidence demonstrating the propriety of every aspect of **Edwards**' involvement in the 
prosecution of legitimate claims against **Epstein**, **Epstein** sued **Bradley **Edwards****. 
**Epstein** sexually abused three clients of **Edwards** — L.M., E.W., and **Jane Doe** — and 
**Edwards** properly and successfully represented them in a civil action against **Epstein**. 
Nothing in **Edwards**'s capable and competent representation of his clients provided 
any basis for a civil lawsuit against him, but the facts did not deter **Epstein** from 
engaging in what was a blatant effort to extort **Bradley **Edwards****, utilizing the nearly 
limitless resources of a vengeful opponent. The extortion failed but the vengeful 
assault by **Epstein** continues. 
**Epstein**'s action against **Edwards** essentially alleged that **Epstein** was damaged by 
**Edwards**, acting in concert with Scott **Rothstein** (President of the **Rothstein** Rosenfeldt 
Adler law firm ("RRA") where **Edwards** worked for a short period of time). **Epstein** 
alleged that **Edwards** joined **Rothstein** in the abusive prosecution of sexual assault 
cases against **Epstein** to "pump" the cases to **Ponzi** scheme investors. As described by 
**Epstein**, investor victims were told by **Rothstein** that three minor girls who were 
sexually assaulted by **Epstein**: LM., E.W., and **Jane Doe** were to be paid up-front 
money to prevent those girls from settling their civil cases against **Epstein**. In 
**Epstein**'s view, these child sexual assault cases had "minimal value" (Complaint &

**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 029315 
Thursday, **September** 12, 2013

42(h)), and **Edwards**'s refusal to force his clients to accept modest settlement offers 
was claimed to breach some duty that **Edwards** owed to **Epstein**. Interestingly, **Epstein** 
never states that he actually made any settlement offers. Even more interestingly, 
**Epstein** was never able to explain how a scheme to defraud third party investors ever 
caused any legally cognizable damage to **Epstein** himself. 
The supposed "proof' of the Complaint's allegations against **Edwards** included 
**Edwards**'s alleged contacts with the media, his attempts to obtain discovery from 
high-profile persons with whom **Epstein** socialized, and use of "ridiculously 
inflammatory" language in arguments in court. Remarkably, **Epstein** filed such 
allegations against **Edwards** despite the fact that **Epstein** had sexually abused each of 
**Edwards**'s clients and others while they were minors. Indeed, in discovery **Epstein** has 
asserted his **Fifth Amendment** privilege rather than answer questions about the extent 
of the sexual abuse of his many victims. Even more remarkably, after filing his suit 
against **Edwards**, **Epstein** settled the three cases **Edwards** handled for an amount that 
**Epstein** insisted be kept confidential. Without violating the strict confidentiality terms 
required by **Epstein**, the cases did not settle for the "minimal value" that **Epstein** 
suggested in his Complaint. 
Because **Epstein** elected to hide behind the shield of his right against self incrimination 
to preclude his disclosing any relevant information about the criminal activity at the 
center of his claims, he was barred from prosecuting his case against **Edwards**. Under 
the well-established "sword and shield" doctrine, **Epstein** could not seek damages 
from **Edwards** while at the same ti
