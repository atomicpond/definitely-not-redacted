The **Guardian** has learned that Rubenfeld is currently the subject of an internal investigation at **Yale**. The 
investigation is focused on Rubenfeld's conduct, particularly with female law students. Students have also 
raised related concerns to **Yale** authorities about Chua's powerful influence in the clerkships process. The 
investigation was initiated before **Kavanaugh** was nominated by Donald Trump to serve on the high court. 
Rubenfeld said in a statement to the **Guardian**: "**In **June****, ******Yale** University**** informed me that it would conduct 
what it terms an 'informal review' of certain allegations, but that to preserve anonymity, I was not entitled to 
know any specifics. As a result, I do not know what I am alleged to have said or done. I was further advised that 
the allegations were not of the kind that would jeopardize my position as a long-tenured member of the faculty.
