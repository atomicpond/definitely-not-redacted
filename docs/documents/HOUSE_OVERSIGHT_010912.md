﻿FREE GROWTH AND OTHER SURPRISES
Draft
Gordon Getty
FOREWORD BY THE AUTHOR
How Come This Book?
**a few months ago**, **Robert Trivers** was kind enough to send me his new book. The
title is “Wild Life”. Perfect two ways. Bob is a world authority on wildlife, to wit
evolutionary biology. But his books and papers about that are already well known.
His new one is about his own wild life, with his ideas in the background.
I’ve started my own book three for four times over **the past decade**. Bob’s got me
started again. Try it. It’s Bob’s real voice. One of his papers, co-authored by Huey
Newton(!), is about deception and self-deception. I never saw much of either in Bob.
I never saw a guy less anxious to impress. Fine if you knew his achievements, and
fine if you didn’t. What he wanted to talk about was great new ideas by others. It
was from him that I first heard about the Hamilton-Zuk parasite theory, and Paul
Ewald’s complementary one about parasites stabilizing population density of hosts.
Both are beautiful examples of the obvious-in-hindsight.
I realized that my book could take a cue from his. My own life hasn’t been wild. It
has been interesting because the genius of my father gave me interesting places to
be and things to do. I could say something about that.
But the book would be mostly about my ideas in economics. Bob’s ideas are well
known to anyone in his field. Mine aren’t. I’m ten years older than Bob, without
much to show for it except in composition. (My last two operas have been getting
some traction, and my SACDs get pretty good radio time.) So I’ll run my economic
ideas up the flagpole, in my real voice, and see if they prove deception or selfdeception
or something worth the time.
Declaring My Biases
I’m a big free market fan. I would love it even if I agreed with socialists that there is
something inherently iniquitous about it. There are bad guys and conflicted motives
Forward By The Author 04/18/16 1
in markets and government both. What I love about it is the chance to prove ideas. I
love Wall Street innovations such as swaps and futures and ETFs and mortgagebacked
securities, even admitting their dangers. And who would have thought that
the ****San Francisco**** Bay area, a stronghold of political correctness at the voters’ booth,
would nonetheless innovate Siri and Alexa and driverless cars, in its free market
havens here and there, over **the past five years**? Remind me the last innovation by a
committee. Who would have thought we would make the world’s best car, the Tesla,
in this labor stronghold? It takes guys who prefer the impossible. It takes guys like
my father.
Yes, that was J. Paul Getty. I’ll declare a bias for him. His faults were just what we
read they were. I liked them fine. My times with him, with an exception I’ll note in
Chapter 1, are some of my favorite memories. I seem to be the opposite of pharaohs
who began their reigns by chiseling off their father’s names from the monuments
and substituting their own. That was something about a ticket to the afterlife. I put
my father’s name on things I build. The afterlife will come as it comes.
Since this book is about growth first, I should say how I feel about growth. Most
economists, which I’m anything but, treat it as a goal. I love innovation, which has
translated to growth, while worrying plenty about growth itself. What happens
when anyone can make a doomsday weapon on his desktop? Depressed people do
away with themselves every day. Some might take the rest of the world with them if
they could. Armageddonist religions wouldn’t be needed. Not even destructive
intentions need be. A doomsday weapon bought at the five and ten might go off by
accident.
Then why do I root for innovation when I’m scared stiff about its consequences?
Because alternatives are scarier still. Humans will innovate anyhow, while Big
Brother or the religious authorities aren’t looking, and I don’t like the prospects of
innovation driven underground. We’ll have to find some way to face the risks and
Forward By The Author 04/18/16 2
manage them. This book doesn’t say how. It will open that can of worms, and others
too, and try to track some but not all to their destinations. One look leads to another.
This shows that I’m not an optimist in the sense of making rosy predictions. But I
seem to show that bias in evaluations. I’m two thirds Panglossian. (Doctor Pangloss
was the guy in Voltaire’s Candide who said that this is the best of all possible
worlds.) I side with the good doctor in that I cannot imagine an improvement to this
world or to the human race. I see the dangers and evils, such as Armageddonists, as
somehow part of the scheme. The world would not be better if it posed no threats
and challenges to solve. To solve them is not to wish them away. The stories of
Aladdin’s lamp and the monkey’s paw tell us that each wish after the first is to undo
the one before. I think that’s what Shaw was telling us in Don Juan in Hell. Don Juan
and the others are free to go to heave
