Flagging for you. This went out to that circle of third party thinkers. Hope all is well, **Jeffrey**.!

Subject: Our May conversation - more thoughts 
Hi all — 
I spent some time mulling additional aspects of a third choice presidential run and wanted to run five 
specific attributes for a candidate by you as a group. 
This much we know - the **Fall** elections are shaping up to be a referendum on the most divisive 
American President in memory. The battle for potential ****Supreme Court**** justice **Brett Kavanaugh**'s 
nomination **this **Fall**** will only amplify the polarity of the political debate that is already deeply 
overwrought on both sides. The rising tide of pressure on Donald **Trump** from the **Mueller** investigation 
shows no sign of ebbing. 
Unless the underlying political dynamics are disrupted, the outcomes of these unprecedented events will 
still leave us with the same unsatisfactory two front battlefield of the **2016** Presidential election. 
Watching these unrelenting, compounding events since our discussion in May, I am guessing we are all 
asking the same question: now what? For the 48 percent of Americans who believe Donald **Trump** 
should not be in **the **White **HOUSE******, perhaps we too want our own "chaos" candidate in **2020**? 
Should **Trump** run again, this could be a "break glass" moment for the majority of Americans who don't 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 026298 
support him. Do we want to break the genteel precedents of two parties running their ceremonious and 
seemingly illogical nominating process to select a candidate? (Why do Iowa and ****New Hampshire**** play 
such outsized roles? What kind of small-d democratic process relies on superdelegates?) The system 
failed **In **2016****, with both parties producing terribly flawed candidates in a race to the bottom. We need to 
build a back-up plan in the event the system fails again. 
It's possible, of course, that we won't need a third-party candidate. **Trump** could decide not to run for 
whatever reason. The Democrats could nominate a winning **2020** candidate. I am not willing to take 
those bets. 
The ideal candidate for a new third party is someone who is widely perceived to be that rare combination 
of both good and great. We are looking for a proven leader of men and women, someone with clear, 
democratic — and moral — values that reflect the best of **America**, not our worst. We know people like this 
on the national stage now. 
As a thought experiment, consider the possibilities of a ticket outside the partisan lanes and imagine the 
chemistry of radical combinations: **Biden**/**Romney**? **Bill Gates**/Hogan? Bloomberg/Haley? Howard 
Schultz/Bob Corker? Sandberg/Kasich? 
As we have discussed narrow path to electing the first president outside the two major party primary 
system in 168 years is more navigable than most think. Heading into **2020**, converging trends in 
American's demands for a third party (a historic high of 61%), disapproval of Donald **Trump** holding 
steady above 50%, and the increasingly leftward drift of **the **Democratic Party**** suggest that electorate may 
be susceptible to merits of a new centrist party. Cynics will say that the structural impediments of ballot 
and presidential debate access, the overwhelming advantages of legacy parties' fundraising and voter 
turn-out operations preordain failure, but they're wrong; the legal and logistical hurdles are amenable to a 
combination of lawyering and resources. The bigger, more consequential factors come in terms of 
candidate quality and policy. I believe a candidate with five specific characteristics including a unique — 
and purposefully non-specific - policy agenda could limbo a win. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 026299 
• This is what I think a successful third-party candidate looks like; a dream third party ticket would 
start off with enough name ID to be an instant contender. Building the name ID to run nationally is 
just too long and expensive of a process to accomplish in the 28 **months** until the next presidential 
election. We can't beat a celebrity without some celebrity of our own, whether from politics, 
sports, business, or entertainment. Instantaneous name ID is so crucial because the candidate must 
start out in striking distance in any three-way poll against **Trump** and a fill-in-the-blank 
Democratic flavor-of-the day candidate. The media and political class will predetermine 
irrelevance otherwise. 
• A Democrat-leaning candidate would have to top the ideal third-party ticket. We need someone 
with a shot at snaking a plurality of the vote in the blue states **Hillary Clinton** won (227 electoral 
votes), but moderate enough to win a plurality in some combination of **Trump** states like **Florida**, 
**Pennsylvania**, **Wisconsin** and **Michigan** (another 119 votes). The right candidate
