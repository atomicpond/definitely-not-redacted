Im not angry, sorry, it is sad. it is apparent that you have no experience trading. we both made a 
mistake. . the spy trades were the results of a rank amatuer. . you took a postion on the direction of the 
market. ok. you decided to play it extra short time and short. . why? becaue the options are cheaper. 
? knowing full well that time premium was running. . first silly move. . I allowed as promised to give you 
authority. . you set a target. . it hit the traget, you moved in back. based on media reporting on trump 
visit? you didnt act. the market dipped and you panicked. . AMATEUR. wrong options wrong timing, 
no discipline and as a percentaage of investment, a **one day** dip fof 25%. wanting to buy the highter strike , is 
ok. but why **the same month**? why the same moment. why the same index. . sorry. I have taught this for 
many years. and your grade is an F. not one good move in many. . re broadcom. the crack happend in 
the morning, options were higher. no alternative presented. no analysis. , this is no way to manage 
money. I have lost a great deal of money hoping you would be able to do as you promised you could . would. 
. Had you told me, **Jeffrey** I d like to try a new job as a manager lets start slow I can learn. i would be 
less annoyed. you told me you had great confidence knew the risks and truly believed you would be able to 
raise money .do well and prosper. . If it were not you, this would have ended **months ago**. . we should 
work on a solution. not sure yet what shape it takes.
