﻿Describe WE Talks, and why you believe it's different from other "empowerment series."

WE Talks (“WE” standing for women empowerment) is an event series for female entrepreneurs and professionals organized on a **monthly** basis. The idea of WE Talks was to create an intimate environment where our attendees can build relationships in an organic way, based on mutual interests and shared values. We encourage our guests to learn not only from our speakers, but also from each other, to connect exchange contacts, and stay in touch. WE Talks is a “safe space,” where it is ok to express your vulnerability (most speakers on our panel address not only their past challenges, but also the current pressing issues), and to ask the community for support and guidance. We also hope that as our community grows, our members meet future business partners, advisors, investors, and friends. 

After attending many business events in **NYC** and internationally, I have noticed that women are less likely to network and introduce themselves than their male peers. That’s why, at every event that we host we try to make curated introductions and make sure that each guest meets at least three people relevant to her business. 

Part of the inspiration for WE Talks was birthed from a negative experience at a popular "empowerment" event. Share that story and how it motivated you to start WE Talks.

Ever since I moved to NY, I have been searching for a community where I would feel comfortable and could turn for guidance. A while ago, I attended a very interesting and intellectually stimulating women summit aimed at empowering female founders and helping them scale up. As the second day of the conference was coming to an end, the participants were encouraged to publicly express their take always. After a long hesitation, I asked for the microphone. It was a big challenge for me, being terrified of public speaking and English being only my third language. I am not sure whether my manner of speaking, or my accent was the reason why the host cut me off after 10 seconds and asked to hurry. After not getting the support I had been looking for from something that was described as the most inclusive and friendly community, I decided to start my own. At WE Talks, we are very inclusive and don’t make judgements based on your accent or physical appearance. If you are driven, ambitious, thoughtful, and giving - you are always welcome here! 


Why is now a more important time than ever for a WE Talks?

I believe the women movement to be one of the most fascinating phenomena of our times. The woman’s role has changed so much in modern society with more women taking leadership positions and starting their own companies. The modern woman is wearing more hats than ever. In the 80-s, a successful woman was expected to pursue an education and then to get married and raise children. Right now, women are expected to have successful careers, be equal financial contributors to the family, and yet maintain their traditional “feminine” roles, including taking care of the home, cooking, and raising kids. 

Yet women with full-time jobs still earn only about 77 percent of their male counterparts' earnings. About four-in-ten employed women  say they have experienced some form of gender discrimination at work. There is also a serious gender gap in startup rates of men and women, where there are about seven women entrepreneurs for every ten men entrepreneurs. The statistics is pretty gloomy in both corporate and startup world. The share of female Fortune 500 CEOs has dropped by 25% in **2018** to 5%. Female founders receive only 2% percent of the venture capital. Nevertheless, female-founded startups generate more revenue and do it with less funding. 

I think networking a paramount to business and personal success. For ages, men had men only clubs, including cigar clubs, university clubs, golf clubs etc. Even nowadays, male investors and intrapreneurs would go out for drinks and talk about business. Women are starting to do it, but just don’t do it enough. Curated networking, right introductions, and a solid community would help narrow the gender gap. 



You were a model, then ran a nonprofit, and now you've started WE Talks. Where did you learn to have the courage to "put yourself out there" and take risks again and again?
I think risk taking is in my DNA. I grew up playing tennis competing on a Junior Circuit and simply couldn’t envision a predictable and “normal” life in **Moscow**. I come from a very patriarchate society where women are encouraged to study and to meet future husband in the their early 20s, then to get married and to take care of the home. The entrepreneurship “à la russe” usually includes your husband or father “buying” a beauty salon/ retail brand/ fashion magazine and the woman “running it”, usually without a solid understanding how business operates and mostly without ever becoming profitable. It just wasn’t for me. My biggest fear in life was not that of f
