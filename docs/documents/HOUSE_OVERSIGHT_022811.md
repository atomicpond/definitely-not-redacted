David BoiesDavid **BOIES**, ****BOIES** Schiller** Flexner 
Diego M. Radzinschi/The National Law Journal  

 
“**Jane Doe** 43″ has formally identified herself as Sarah Ransome in a sexual trafficking lawsuit that her lawyers at ****BOIES** Schiller** Flexner are pursuing against billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.
 
In a notice to change the case caption filed **Friday** in **Manhattan** federal court, Ransome’s attorneys said she “no longer intends to proceed by way of pseudonym” in the case, which claims Epstein forced her to have sex for money.
 
Defense lawyers for Epstein had argued that Ransome must litigate under her own name after she wrote a Nov. 15 letter to **the New York **Times****, which the **Times** published, in which she defended ****BOIES** Schiller** and firm chairman **David **BOIES**** against criticism stemming from **BOIES**’ work for Harvey Weinstein.
 
Ransome identified herself as **Jane Doe** 43 in the **Times** letter, which said **BOIES** “heard me and came to my rescue” when others refused to take her allegations against Epstein seriously. “For the first time in **10 years** I finally feel safe because of **David **BOIES**** and his colleagues,” wrote Ransome, who also said the firm did not charge her legal fees.
 
The letter was prompted by a Nov. 9 **Times** op-ed by **Stanford University** law professor Deborah Rhode, titled “**David **BOIES****’s Egregious Involvement With Harvey Weinstein.” Written in the wake of revelations in **The New Yorker** that **BOIES** had engaged private investigators to kill an investigation by **Times** reporters into Weinstein’s alleged sexual predations, the op-ed suggested that **BOIES**’ work for Weinstein was unethical, partly because the **Times**’ was a ****BOIES** Schiller** client.
 
Two days earlier, on Nov. 7, following publication of **The New Yorker** article, **BOIES** had issued a statement addressed to his firm, stating that Weinstein was no longer a client and stressing that he “would never knowingly participate in an effort to intimidate or silence women or anyone else.”
 
In a Nov. 21 brief in the Epstein litigation, defense lawyer Michael Miller of **Steptoe & Johnson LLP** argued that Ransome had never satisfied requirements to file anonymously and had publicly identified herself with her letter to the **Times**, so she should be required to add her name to the case caption.
 
**Sigrid McCawley**, a ****BOIES** Schiller** partner in the firm’s **Fort Lauderdale** office who represents Ransome along with **BOIES** and others, said her client ultimately chose to go public with her name “in the hopes that her courage will inspire other Epstein victims to speak their truth.”
