Importance: High 
gender differenece. unlikely motivational, every cell is different. size is didfferent. . 
the more radical idea is that brains are the nucleus of the human" cell: the body the membrane, the 
organizm the colletcions and interactions of brains, wisdom of crowds . mirroring. etc. . money used 
as signals. as is spoken language. . what does social behavior mean, it is the cooridiation of indiv brains. = 
I think that mathematics based thinking does not allow for censorship. money people concepts if they are 
all math , then poliiical correctness and their structures are only subsets of a larger group of thoughts. its not 
emotinal for me.

Some thoughts I meant to send back for a long time: 
no worry, if i understand correctly you are suggsting there are layers 1 through N . lets **Cal** them L 1 - 
Ln. there are times T 1- Tn / and then conjecture that changing the time . correlations ( by genetic swtch or 
other method. , you might be able to make blacks smarter by changing the time for motor layer 
development and changing the time for other layers. . ). like telemeres for the cell , are their equivalents for 
the layers. . as you talked about culling the unused neurons in each layer, each neuron in each layer would get 
dfferent ( kill yourself if you are not being used instructions ). 
Exactly. I looked up the statistics, black kids in the US have slower cognitive development (and never catch 
up), which the study of course attributed to social factors without any evidence, and they had faster motor 
development! I suspect this means their brains are slower at learning high-level concepts, because the low-
level structures are optimized for a shorter time. But they will keep the lead in motor development, because it 
is easier to learn, and they have more time and attention to practice once they get the structures in place. 
It could also be that they have an additional set of learning directives in place that adapts them better to a more 
hunting/running style of life, whereas the Europeans had to adapt for identifying long-term seasonal patterns, 
delayed gratification for agriculture etc. 
and CONCEPTS could be layer to layer communicaiton. . are gender differences also a matter of time , and 
structure of interactions. . 
I suspect gender differences are mostly motivational, i.e. we have a reward system for all the different social 
and cognitive needs, which makes us receive different kinds of pleasure and pain, thereby pay attention and 
learn. You cannot learn what does not attract your attention. Women tend to find abstract systems, conflicts 
and mechanisms intrinsically boring. Most women in computer science do not write programs because they 
enjoy solving puzzles, but because they want to help people, get approval etc. There are almost no women in 
math, because it does not help people or yield social attention. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 026393 
Men tend to find elaborate social relations boring. If there is no pleasure in observing and empathizing with 
people, one will not have good social cognition. 
IQ is not the only meaningful difference. Chinese pay an inordinate amount of attention to authority. I suspect 
historically., the authorities tended to kill them a lot if they did not. Jews tend be intellectually independent and 
anti-authoritarian, which might make them creative and inventive in ways that are hard to find in **Asia**. 
At the moment, I think speed/quality of brain development plus motivational system are the key to 
understanding both mind and individual differences. Important part of human language might be the result in a 
motivational need to discover/invent grammatical structure, which as a side effect makes us interested in 
music. 
It would mean that **Chomsky**'s life long hypothesis, that people have a special circuit for grammatical 
language, is wrong. They might be GENERAL learners, just like Gorillas, but with a strong motivational urge 
to build grammatical structure, which the brain simply invents (there are only a few ways in which a natural 
language can work). That is much easier to wire into a brain than a specific circuit. 
i my self believe that african music, westrn music , chinese music are a window into the the structure of those 
layers. . western rigid, african primitve , chinese nature based, . I belive that synphoic movments best 
describe your layering, they open with a basic simple melody„ after it is learned, it is repeated and" 
developed" , inverted, distorted, related, etc. the development stage take a long time. then there is a 
recapitlaltion of the whole. and its inter and intra actions. . african musci has lots of beats. and little 
development. - no accident, it mirrors their learning process. 
Interesting question if music is somehow indic
