Hi **marty**, 
Hope all is well. Noticed this **Guardian** story about **Michael Wolff** s new book, which states Donald **Trump** 
purchased a **Palm Beach** property Mr. **Epstein** had planned to buy, behind Mr. **Epstein**'s back. And that Mr. 
**Epstein** threatened to expose **Trump**'s shady real estate deals. Do you know anything about this? Does Mr. 
**Epstein** have any knowledge of illegal or suspicious dealings by President **Trump**?

Also, we plan on running a story **this Friday** about **the Crime Victims' Rights Act** suit, and the **Jane** Does' 
proposed remedies. The alleged victims want the U.S. Attorney's Office to rescind the immunity provisions in 
the **NPA**, and to pursue a prosecution against Mr. **Epstein** and his co-conspirators. Can you comment on this? 
Thanks so much!
