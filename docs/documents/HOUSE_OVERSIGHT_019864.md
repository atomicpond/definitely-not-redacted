﻿SERIOUS MOONLIGHT
Behind the scenes at the 2017 **Academy Awards** with filmdom’s first lady of Oscar cheerleading
(my close friends know I was captain of the twirlers in high school)
By **Peggy Siegal**
Was **this year** different from all other years at the Oscars?
In one way, it wasn't. A24's "Moonlight" won best picture because voters went for content over
style. The win was for it’s poetic take on the American ideals that the Academy values most and
wants reflected globally. History was also made as "Moonlight" became the first Oscar winner
with an all black cast and addressed the LGBTQ community. And, it was a beautiful film.
But on the other hand, Oscar voters were also dealing with a political and emotional crisis in the
film industry. After two years of #OscarsSoWhite, they responded by nominating a record six
African American actors, four African American producers and one African American director,
Barry Jenkins, the fourth ever nominated in that category. Three films addressing race were
nominated for best picture: “Fences,” “Hidden Figures” and “Moonlight.”
**Lionsgate**'s "La La Land" was a joyous escape from months of simmering frustration and anger
at Donald J. Trump, himself a creature of the entertainment industry. The charming and modern
musical “La La” danced its way to multiple awards from critics, at the PGA, the DGA, the BAFTA
and the Venice Film Festival, a record seven **Golden Globes**, en route to an historic fourteen
****Academy Award**** nominations. Prognosticators predicted a "La La” landslide.
So what happened? Days before the voting deadline, "La La Land" was tripped-up by a lastminute
backlash against frivolity. Even in La La Land, these are serious times.
Backstage at the Dolby Theater, star-struck nitwit accountant Brian Cullinan, oblivious to the
fact that the Oscars are a sacred secular ceremony and distracted while tweeting a photo of
Emma Stone, handed Warren Beatty the wrong envelope. Chaos—and headlines—ensued.
Tweets, chaos and headlines? It was all too Trump for words.
When I arrived at the Dolby Theater that night, I asked a dateless Andrew Garfield to take me
onto the red carpet with him, to the chagrin of his publicist. But a security guard rejected me
because my ticket was the wrong color. Andrew winked, laughed and disappeared. Undaunted,
I went back to the curb to find another walker. As I stood at the limo drop-off, inconspicuous in a
day-glow orange satin dress, Kelly Bush, a publicist I knew from **last year's** "The Revenant"
campaign, sidled over and said, "There is going to be an upset. ‘Moonlight’ is winning."
On cue, “La La Land” producer Marc Platt arrived with the studs on his formal shirt popping off.
As I nervously fiddled in his buttonholes, I blurted, "Kelly Bush just said ‘Moonlight’ is winning.”
Marc turned white.
The red carpet was a three lane highway. The speed lane was for the super stars, the middle for
frantic handlers, and on the right was the schlepper lane for relatives and relative nobodies.
Four security guards escorted me there. By the time Marc and I met again at the end of the
three prong red carpet, "La La Land" publicist and ****West Coast**** campaign queen Lisa Taback
was furious I’d told the shaken producer his film might lose. I said, "Kelly Bush said that, not
me." But I felt terrible.
Sure enough, the “La La” landslide never happened. It did win a spectacular six Oscars before
Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway walked to center stage for the best picture finale.
I was now standing against the wall at the first row of the first balcony. **Lionsgate** publicists Julie
Fontaine and Jennifer Peterson, both dressed in haute couture gowns and borrowed emeralds,
anxiously insisted I join their good luck group hug as best picture was announced. Despite my
faux pas, and my work on most of the year’s top films, including “Moonlight,” “**Manchester** by the
Sea” and “Hidden Figures,” Oscar night I was in the “La La” camp due to my long friendship with
it’s director Damien Chazelle.
So we three bejeweled broads were hugging tightly, when Faye broke Warren’s pregnant pause
and screamed "La La Land". The girls cried, the “La La” producers ran to the stage and I was
thinking about how to apologize to Marc Platt as he thanked his family. Then, the stage filled up
with men in headsets. Producer Jordan Horowitz, the class act of the evening, grabbed the right
card and calmly announced "Moonlight. No Joke." Platt, Horowitz and their co-producer Fred
Berger handed their Oscars to Moonlight director Barry Jenkins, and producers Jeremy Kleiner
and Adele Romanski and left the stage as Mahershala Ali, the first Muslim actor to get the gold
guy, joined the cast waving his historic Oscar.
Julie and Jennifer ran to **Soho House** to oversee **Lionsgate**'s victory party, where hundreds of
confused well-wishers waited to celebrate the “La La” wins, including Emma Stone’s best
actress, Justin Hurwitz’s best score, and Benj Pasek, Justin Paul and Justin Hurwitz’s best song
for “City of Stars.” At 32, Damien
