Wealthy Palm Beacher Jeffrey Epstein in ****Palm Beach** County** **Circuit Court** in 2008 to plead guilty to criminal charges stemming from claims he had teenage girls give him sexual massages. (Uma Sanghvi/**The **Palm Beach** **Post****)

Updated: 3:43 p.m. Friday, **May 12**, **2017** |  Posted: 2:45 p.m. Friday, **May 12**, **2017**





**Palm Beach** —
President Donald **Trump** is a shadowy, but ever-present, figure in the never-ending saga of billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Mar-a-Lago, the commander-in-chief’s private-club-turned-southern-White-House in **Palm Beach**, was the backdrop for Epstein’s introduction to one of his dozens of teenage victims, according to court records.

In a short-lived lawsuit that **Trump** decried as “categorically false,” a **California** woman **last year** sued **Trump** and Epstein in federal court in **New York City**, claiming the two business tycoons raped her when she was **13 **years** old**.

And **Trump** is on a star-studded witness list for an upcoming trial in ****Palm Beach** County** **Circuit Court** that attorney **Jack **Scarola**** promises will be the first public airing of Epstein’s lurid lifestyle.

But, **Scarola** acknowledges, it is unlikely the president will be part of what **Scarola** promises will be a salacious trial. **Scarola** claims Epstein sued attorney **Brad Edwards** in an effort to intimidate and punish the lawyer for representing some of Epstein’s victims. While Epstein dropped his lawsuit against Edwards, who has also represented clients in a lawsuit against **Trump**, the malicious prosecution suit against Epstein will likely go to trial in the fall, **Scarola** said.

When **Scarola** put **Trump** on the witness list in **August**, he said he never imagined the business scion and former television star would soon occupy the Oval Office. The legal battle he would have to launch to get a sitting president to testify simply isn’t worth it, **Scarola** said.

Moreover, while there is a lot of smoke around **Trump**’s relationship with Epstein, there appears to be little fire, so far, **Scarola** said.

“Based on all available public records, **Trump**’s involvement is peripheral,” he said.

While **Trump** has recently distanced himself from Epstein, a 64-year-old financier, it wasn’t always that way.

“I’ve known Jeff for **fifteen **years****. Terrific guy,” **Trump** said of Epstein during a **2002** interview with New York magazine. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”

Attorney Spencer Kuvin, one of dozens of lawyers who successfully sued Epstein on behalf of roughly 30 women who claimed he lured them to his **Palm Beach** mansion for sexually-charged massages when they were as young as 14, said he always found the comment curious.

“How would he know that?” he said of **Trump**’s acknowledgement of Epstein’s penchant for young women. The interview came nearly six **years** before Epstein’s secret sex life exploded into public view when the money manager pleaded guilty to Florida charges of procuring and soliciting a minor for prostitution. “Why would he make a joke like that?” the **West **Palm Beach**** attorney asked.

Further, Kuvin and others say they can’t believe it is purely coincidental that former **South Florida** U.S. Attorney **Alex Acosta**, who signed off on a non-prosecution agreement that kept Epstein from spending **years** behind bars, was tapped by **Trump** to be U.S. Labor Secretary.

During his confirmation hearings in **March**, Acosta said it was “awful” that convicted sex offender Epstein was allowed to leave the ****Palm Beach** County** Jail to work during his **13-month** jail sentence. But he insisted that without the involvement of his office, Epstein would have received far less punishment and his victims wouldn’t have recovered any money from him. As a result of the conviction, Epstein also is on Florida’s registered sex offender list.

**Scarola**, who has represented several of Epstein’s victims in civil lawsuits, scoffed at Acosta’s claims. The evidence that Epstein sexually abused young girls was “overwhelming,” he said.

The answer to the many questions that still swirl around Epstein and his high-placed friends are the subject of roughly a half-dozen lawsuits that are still pending in both ****Palm Beach** County** and New York. Some of the nation’s top attorneys have represented Epstein and some of his victims.

But like many of the past lawsuits spawned by Epstein’s behavior, most of the remaining ones are expected to be settled. And even public court records don’t tell the full story — because many documents have been sealed or are heavily redacted.

For example, a defamation lawsuit against one of Epstein’s close friends was scheduled to go to trial in U.S. ****District Court**** in New York this coming Monday. But both sides agreed to a delay **last week**, often a signal that a settlement could be in the works.

The suit was filed by Virginia Roberts **Giuffre** against British-born socialite and longtime Epstein friend Ghislaine **Maxwell**. In a **2009** lawsui
