only found out afterwards? and the fact according to the indicment was billed as services rendered and 
grossed up. im sure his acct has flipped anyway. . I did talk in detail to **starr** **yesterday** re indicments how 
trump can make a deal ( special counsel) . **Clintons** trash can yes **starr** gave me more. YECHHHH! .
