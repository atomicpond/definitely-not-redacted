Rich Beckler, 
Ken Adams, 
Do you remember when I'd asked you what your daughters did for a living? Especially last night Mr. 
Beckler, as most Friday nights, no? 
Yes, they are the new iterations of **Ghislaine Maxwell**; for you Richard Beckler, this originated from 
my being a former Stone Ridge classmate of his elder daughter Katie Beckler, and because he was 
on the Board of Stone Ridge during this period in time when my every family, friend, acquaintance 
and association was being contacted, bribed in one form or another, and turned against me (see 
below); as for Ken Adams, it stemmed from my having contacted him for representation in my 2011-
filed case against IBM also during this period of time when my every communication were being 
tracked. 
You both are interesting; you let us see what's to become of the Scalia 35 (see below; at bottom, 
****Ghislaine Maxwell**'s** Jeffrey Epstein in context.) 
We start from this following precept: (the repeating 9/11s) 
1. "Toward a New World Order" speech by Pres. George H.W. Bush — 9/11 (1990) 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 015002 
2. WTC Attack — 9/11 (2001) 
3. BENGHAZI Attack — 9/11 (2012) 
But you have to remember that H. W. Bush was planted: 
AUTHOR PETER DALE SCOTT: Sometimes you have little deep events that most people don't even 
notice. One of those would be the Halloween Massacre. The older people remember the Saturday 
Night Massacre which happened under Nixon. I'm talking about the Halloween Massacre of October 
31, 1975, and probably people watching this show have never heard of it. 
That was under Ford, and Ford may have condoned it because it was trying to help restore his 
popularity. He was going way down in the polls. But it was a very important series of events all on the 
same night. The head of the CIA was fired, William Colby, replaced by a relatively unknown man 
called George H. W. Bush who then went on to authorize something that Colby had refused to 
authorize - the Team B report - the Team B to recalculate the Soviet threat and it was pre-
determined. They were going to find that it was much bigger than the professionals angled like 
Raymond [inaudible] that I mentioned. 
They said Russia is less of a threat now than it used to be. Well, that was terrible news for the 
industrial complex so the Team B came in and said oh, no, no, no, it's much more of a threat than it 
used to be, and that's why we got this huge military build-up. It started actually under Carter but we 
think of it as the Reagan build-up, and that of course is a major factor in having ended the Soviet 
Union because **the Soviet Union** tried to match it with a weaker economy. And that arms race which 
was not about threats but was about fighting economic war, that was an arms race which you could 
say that **the Soviet Union** lost because they couldn't keep it up. Their economy went more and more 
downhill because they were deflecting resources away from vital domestic functions. But really I'm 
trying to talk here about the Halloween Massacre... 
Just the change in the CIA was a major historical event but it wasn't very visible. The second thing 
that happened was they fired Jim Schlesinger as Secretary of Defense... It was being done by 
[President Ford's] Chief of Staff and his assistant who are two names barely known then but quite 
famous since. Chief of staff was Donald Rumsfeld and the assistant was **Dick Cheney**. And that was 
the first real intrusion of the Rumsfeld-Cheney team into American politics. And they became the real 
heart of what I consider **the Deep State** in the 1980s when they were planning for Continuity of 
Government which was a plan for emergency rules like warrantless surveillance and warrantless 
detention and the militarization of homeland security. All those things were planned all through the 
'80s - COG planning by Donald Rumsfeld and **Dick Cheney**. Even when Rumsfeld wasn't in the 
government, he was authorized by Reagan to do this planning. 
And why is that important to our history? Because in 2001, these two men were now in the 
government - **Vice President** and Secretary of Defense - the two top people in **Washington** on 
September the 11th, 2001 when Bush was down in Florida - George W. Bush - and what did they do 
on that day? They implemented the plans they had been planning for 20 years. Another major event 
in American history but it's not usually told that way. 
We implemented - it's in the 9/11 C
