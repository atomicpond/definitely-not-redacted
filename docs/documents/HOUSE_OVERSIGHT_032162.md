David Ben Gurion was asked why he, after **2000** 
years, in contrast to the many great leaders in 
the past was uniquely able to re -established the 
**State** of **Israel**. BG responded that he thought that 
it must have been true that in ancient times people 
had been born with a sixth sense. The one 
enabling individuals to have the ability 
to recognize and the seize opportunities. Though 
few of those individuals remain I think I am one of 
the fortunate few. He didn't mentioned the horrors 
or the sacrifice of the 48' war. I believe 
Menachem Begin had it,as **several years** after the 
bitter 73' war he was able to make a daring 
peace with **Egypt**. Als lzhak **Rabin**,who now 20yrs 
ago, signed the Peace treaty with **Jordan** though 
in amidst a wave of terror. He faced huge internal 
rejection but it began the first baby steps towards 
a settlement with the Palestinians. As we all know 
he was assassinated by a Jewish terrorist. These 
leaders all faced many risks, yet were able to see 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 032162 
and seize an opportunity. Statesmanship and 
leadership.. 
During **the last three years** we have been living 
through a geo political earthquake. The world 
order, which existed since the demise of the 
Ottoman Empire, is collapsing.The Arab Spring 
appears to have turned into an Islamist Winter. 
Borders are erased. Old tribal and sectarian 
disputes have awakened. In perfect storm like 
fashion **Israel** now finds itself surrounded by 
clashes of civilizations, in addition to the Islam 
confrontation between fanatic terror and moderna, 
Suna and Shia, the legacy threats: **Iran**, **Assad** in 
**Syria**, Hezbullah in **Lebanon**,**Hamas** in **Gaza** are 
all still active and worrying. 
we have to be alert and ready to strongly respond 
to any threat to our security.. 
But I believe new opportunities are there for the 
taking. This opportunity,which might not occur 
again for generations ,is the potential to reshape 
our relationships with the Arab Moderates based 
on our common concerns. Extremism, Terror and 
**Iran**. This could open the gate to a more peaceful 
**Middle East** based on cooperation and synergies 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 032163 
rather than blood and revenge. However thers is, 
in my opnion n o way to achieve but to move 
forward with the Palestinians 
A precondition to seize such an opportunity is a 
mighty, sober, self confident **Israel**, in strong 
alliance with the US. An **Israel** which can deter or 
defeat any combination of regional powers, yet, an 
**Israel** who is ready to contemplate and consider a 
modified Saudi or Arab League Plan as a basis for 
negotiations. 
The unique relationship we have developed with 
the US over the last 45yrs based on common 
values ,mutual respect and shared interests is a 
cornerstone of our strength, world posture and 
our future. It is also a crucial building block of any 
regional peace and cooperation strategy.Allowing 
IL/US relations to remain damaged, I believe is a 
grave mistake with potentially far reaching 
consequences. 
As the Minister of Defense of **Israel** I've met more 
than once with President Obama , as well as with 
President **Bush** before him„ reiterating with both 
that the though the US is clearly our best friend 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 032164 
and ally, **Israel** is a **Sovereign** **State** and when our 
security and the future of **Israel** and the Jewish 
people are at stake we might need to take 
tough decisions on our own. We cannot and will 
not, I added, delegate the responsibility for such 
decisions to even our best friends ,. We respect 
the fact that we might have different views. 
American Presidents have always understood that 
. We also must have the same respect when the 
US decides it is its interest to take decisions we 
might not fully agree with. 
this relation is of course not fully symmetric. It is 
the US which will provides **Israel** with the new F-
35s and ensures the Qualitative Edge of the **IDF** 
vis a vis any combination of neighbors. It is the 
US who significantly financed the Iron Dome, 
Arrow and David's Sling missile defense systems. 
It is the US that has commited to defend **Israel** in 
the event of a missile attack from **Iran**. 
We should never forget it. 
The recent spurt of verbal exchanges is a 
worrying signal that something has gone wrong. It 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 032165 
needs corrrection.. **Netanyahu** is not a coward. 
I've seen him as a young special forces 
officer ,under my command, facing fire directly and 
taking risks to his life. A very courageous soldier. 
That will never change. cheap words serve little 
purpose .The same applies to President Obama 
and Secretary **Kerry**. they are not enemies of 
**Israel**. they are Good Friends. **Kerry** has exhibited 
**decades** long support for **Israel**. Since he became 
Secretary of **State** he has invested his time 
energy and prestige trying to help **Israel** and the 
Palestinians to bridge disputes and reach a 
breakthrough. it was
