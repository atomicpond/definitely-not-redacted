v.

**United States** **District Court**
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
Case No. 9:08-80736-Civ-Marra/Johnson
JANE DOE NO. 1 AND JANE DOE NO. 2’S RESPONSE TO SUPPLEMENT IN
SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR LMITED INTERVENTION BY ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ
COME NOW Jane Doe No. 1 and Jane Doe No. 2 (the “current victims”), by and through
undersigned counsel, to file this response to the Supplement to Reply in Support of Motion for
Limited Intervention by Alan Dershowitz (DE 317-1). Dershowitz claims that an affidavit
submitted by Jane Doe No. 3 in support of an unrelated pleading proves that she is “lying with
respect to her claims against [him].” DE 317-1 at 1. The affidavit proves nothing of the sort.
Indeed, if recent pleadings show anything, it is that Dershowitz continues to hide the truth about
his activities.
Before turning to the specifics of what Dershowitz argues in his supplement, it is even
more important to consider what he fails to argue. In neither his original reply (DE 306) nor his
recent supplement (DE 317-1) has Dershowitz provided specific evidence to contest Jane Doe
No. 3’s allegations that he sexually molested her. This omission is revealing, because
Dershowitz has repeatedly claimed in the media that he has irrefutable proof that her allegations
are false. For example, on January 7, 2015, on the **Fox Business** (Lou Dobbs) program,
Dershowitz stated: “I did the investigation in a day and was able to prove through all kinds of
1
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 3 of 34
records that I couldn’t have been in these places. The woman is a serial liar. If [Cassell and
Edwards] had done that investigation, they would have come to the same conclusion.” 1
Similarly, on January 8, 2015, on the Greta van Susteren show on FOX, Dershowitz claimed:
“Now I can prove through documentary evidence that I was never at the times and places she
[Jane Doe No. 3] alleges she had sex with me.” 2
Yet despite having publicly claimed to have
“all kinds of records” and “documentary evidence” that “prove” Jane Doe No. 3 is lying,
Dershowitz has yet to produce a single document to this Court. Dershowitz’s intransigence is
not limited to this case, as he has also refused to comply with discovery requests in a parallel
defamation action in state court. His refusal has led to a pending motion to compel. See
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Production of Documents, Edwards v. Dershowitz, No. CACE 15-
000072 (Feb. 23, 2015) (attached as Exhibit 1) (“despite having had 45 days to gather materials
that allegedly provide ‘absolute proof’ than he has never even met Jane Doe No. 3 – and despite
having told numerous media sources that he had already collected such information –
Dershowitz has provided none of these documents . . . .”). 3
The Court should draw the obvious
inference that Dershowitz, despite making broad claims to the media, has no such evidence to
produce – because Jane Doe No. 3’s allegations are true.

3 Jane Doe No. 3 explained in her earlier response that the Court should not allow
Dershowitz to intervene here because he can protect his (alleged) reputational interests in the
pending defamation action. DE 291 at 11-12). The Court may be interested to learn that
Dershowitz has recently filed a counterclaim against Edwards and Cassell for defaming him in
that action – suggesting he can litigate his reputational interests there, and thus has no need to do
so here.

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 4 of 34
In his most recent supplemental filing with this court (DE 317-1), Dershowitz twists the
facts and jumps to conclusions in service of his crusade against Jane Doe No. 3. For example,
Dershowitz notes that Jane Doe No. 3 told attorney Edwards before April 2011 that Dershowitz
had abused her, but then says “she and Edwards sat on this highly charged accusation for three
years and eight months before first using it in their [sic] pleading filed on **December 30, 2014**.
This constitutes laches that prejudiced . . . Dershowitz . . . .” DE 317-1 at 2. Dershowitz ignores
the key fact that in April 2011, attorney Edwards did not represent Jane Doe No. 3. Accordingly,
he could not “sit” on her claims against Dershowitz because he was not empowered, at that time,
to pursue them. 4
With regard to the claim of laches, Dershowitz argues that he has been prejudiced
