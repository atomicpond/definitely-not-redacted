A new lawsuit has revealed the extent of former President Clinton's friendship with a fundraiser who was
later jailed for having sex with an underage prostitute.
Bill Clinton's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, who served time in 2008 for his illegal sexual partners,
included up multiple trips to the onetime billionaire's private island in the **Caribbean** where underage girls
were allegedly kept as sex slaves.
**the National Enquirer** has released new details about the two men's friendship, which seems to have
ended abruptly around the time of Epstein's arrest.
Naming names: A lawsuit between Jeffrey Epstein (right, in 2011) and his legal team has
included multiple mentions about the convicted pedophile's connection to former
President Bill Clinton (left, **Earlier this month**)
Pedophile paradise: The lawsuit included flight records that showed Clinton made multiple
trips to Epstein's private island, ****Little St** James** (pictured), **between 2002 and 2005**.
Women were reportedly kept there as sex slaves
Tales of orgies and young girls being shipped to the island, called **Little St**. James, have been revealed as
part of an ongoing lawsuit between Epstein and his former lawyers Scott Rothstein and **Bradley Edwards**.
It is unclear what the basis of the suit is, but they go on to call witness testimony from some of the
frequent guests at Epstein's island to talk about the wild parties that were held there in **the early 2000s**.
Flight logs pinpoint Clinton's trips on Epstein's jet
between the years 2002 and 2005, while he was working
on his philanthropic post-presidential career and while
his wife Hillary was a Senator for their adopted **State** of New York.
Convicted: Epstein was investigated in 2005 after a
woman reported that he paid her **14-year-old** daughter for
sex
'I remember asking Jeffrey what's Bill Clinton doing here kind fo thing, and he laughed it off and said well
he owes me a favor,' one unidentified woman said in the lawsuit, which was filed in Palm Beach Circuit
Court.
The woman went on to say how orgies were a regular occurrence and she recalled two young girls from
New York who were always seen around the five-house compound but their personal backstories were
never revealed.
At least one woman on the compound was there unwillingly, as the suit identifies a woman as **Jane Doe**
102.
She 'was forced to live as one of Epstein's underage sex slaves for years and was forced to have sex with...
politicians, businessmen, royalty, academicians, etc,' the lawsuit says according to The Enquirer.
Epstein's sexual exploits have been documented since 2005, when a woman in Palm Beach contacted
police saying that her **14-year-old** daughter had been paid $300 to massage him and then have sex.
The claim prompted a nearly **year-long** investigation that led to the eventual charge of soliciting
prostitution which came as part of a plea deal. He spent **13 **months**** of a **18-month** sentence in jail and
remains a registered sex offender.
Several of his famous friends cut ties- including Clinton and then-New York Governor **Eliot Spitzer** who
returned his campaign donations- but not all of them: Prince Andrew reportedly stayed at Epstein's
mansion in New York in 2010, **months** after he was released from jail.

Keeping ties: Clinton was also friends with an unnamed woman who stored pictures of
underage girls for Epstein, and though Clinton cut ties with Epstein after his arrest, he
invited the woman to **Chelsea**'s 2010 wedding
Clinton's connection to Epstein, who worked as a financier and education philanthropist before more than
40 women came forward with claims about him being a sexual predator, has been long-established, but
The Enquirer also tells how the former president was also friends with some of Epstein's seedy
acquaintances.
The lawsuit claims that Clinton was friends with an unnamed woman who 'kept images of naked underage
children on her computer, helped to recruit underage children for Epstein... and pho
