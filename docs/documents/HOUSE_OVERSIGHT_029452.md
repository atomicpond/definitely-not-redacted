Peter
Thiel’s
Money
Talks,
in
Contentious
Ways.
But
What
Does
He
Say?
By DAVID STREITFELD MARCH 7, **2018**
**Peter Thiel** is ****Silicon Valley****’s homegrown Cassandra. He warned for **years** that the
big tech companies were arrogant and clueless and less good for mankind than
they believed.
Comeuppance, the billionaire investor warned, was coming.
Trouble has now arrived. Unfortunately for **Mr. Thiel**, the storm is centered on
**Facebook**, whose board he has been a member of practically since its founding. The
social network, which billed itself as bringing democracy and enlightenment to the
world, was used by the Russians to subvert democracy and sow confusion in the
**United States**.
Even people paid to see the future didn’t see that one coming.
“The board’s role is to help think about some of the medium- and longer-term
problems coming around the corner,” **Mr. Thiel** said. “We were far from perfect in
doing that.”
**Mr. Thiel**, 50, is at the center of nearly every issue that roils ****Silicon Valley****,
ranging from the tech elite’s fascination with ****New Zealand**** hideaways (**Mr. Thiel**
obtained ****New Zealand**** citizenship) to Bitcoin (he is a major investor) to the
problems of herd thinking (he is moving from ****San Francisco**** to ****Los Angeles**** to
escape it) to the evolving role of content on the internet (he has been exploring the
creation of a media company that would outflank **Breitbart** and **Fox** for a younger
audience).
Two subjects are currently overwhelming everything else: **President **Trump****,
whom **Mr. Thiel** aggressively backed for president, and **Facebook**, whose core
mission is being called into question in the wake of the Russian revelations. In a
typical Thiel move — he tends to run toward controversy even as his ****Silicon Valley****
peers try to make themselves inconspicuous — he agreed, in a rare interview, to
talk about both.
“It’s been a crazier **two **years**** than I would have thought,” **Mr. Thiel** said in his new
Midtown Manhattan apartment, which is so far up in the clouds that it literally
looks down on ****Trump** Tower**.
Despite the proximity, the mutual enthusiasm between **Mr. Thiel** and Mr.
**Trump** seems to have cooled. After **Mr. Thiel** spoke at the Republican National
Convention in **2016**, there were unsourced media reports that said Mr. **Trump**
wanted to put him on **the **Supreme Court****. But now even photo ops are rare.
The investor said he had last spoken to the president “**a few months ago**.”
“We don’t talk that often,” he said, but added, “I can get access anytime I
want.”
The **Trump** whom **Mr. Thiel** touted at the Republican convention was a
candidate who would “end the era of stupid wars and rebuild our country,” move
us past “fake culture wars” and start projects the equivalent of the **Apollo** space
program. That does not seem to be the president he got.
“There are all these ways that things have fallen short,” **Mr. Thiel** said. But he
said he had no regrets about his endorsement. “It’s still better than **Hillary Clinton**
or the Republican zombies,” he said, referring to the other candidates.
****the **White House****** did not respond to a request for comment.
**Mr. Thiel** is routinely labeled a libertarian. On a bookshelf in the apartment, as
if in confirmation, is a hardback copy of Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged,” the bible of
the movement. A gift, he said.
A lesser-known but possibly deeper influence was the French philosopher
René Girard, who taught at **Stanford University** when **Mr. Thiel** was an
undergraduate there. For **15 **years****, on and off, **Mr. Thiel** sat in on a study group
about Mr. Girard’s ideas. Mr. Girard believed human beings were deeply mimetic,
which is to say they copy one another.
“It’s very anti-Ayn Rand: There are no self-contained autonomous figures,”
**Mr. Thiel** said. “Our desires are not our own. They get shaped powerfully by the
society around us.”
It was this illumination that helped him see the potential of **Facebook** — where
people could find out in intimate and addictive detail what their friends were up to
— when it was barely a year old. He was the first outside investor, buying 10
percent of the company for $500,000.
He sold most of his holdings in **2012** as **Facebook** went public. A few months
ago, with **Facebook**’s market capitalization at about $500 billion, he sold most of
what he had left.
**last summer**, there was a flap when a memo by a fellow board member, Reed
Hastings, the chief executive of **Netflix**, appeared in **the New York Times**. In the
memo, Mr. Hastings wrote to **Mr. Thiel** that he displayed “catastrophically bad
judgment” in supporting Mr. **Trump**.
**Mark Zuckerberg**, **Facebook**’s chief executive, did not ask him to step down
from the board, and reports that he wants to leave the board are incorrect, Mr.
Thiel said, noting that among other things that he brings “ideological diversity.” He
declined to say exactly how much or what kind of advice the **Facebook** board was
offering Mr. Zuckerberg, but defended the company from criticism that it was slow
to wake up to what the Russians did.
“Remember when **Trump** said the election was going to be
