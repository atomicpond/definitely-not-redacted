**Donald Trump's** newly named chief strategist and senior counselor, Steve Bannon, laid 
out his global nationalist vision in unusually in-depth remarks delivered by Skype to a 
conference held inside the Vatican in **the summer of 2014**. 
Well before victories for Brexit and Trump seemed possible, Bannon declared there was 
a "global tea party movement" and praised European far-right parties like Great 
Britain's UKIP and France's ****National Front****. Bannon also suggested that a racist 
element in far-right parties "all gets kind of washed out," that the West was facing a 
"crisis of capitalism" after losing its "Judeo-Christian foundation," and he blasted "crony 
capitalists" in Washington for failing to prosecute bank executives over the financial 
crisis. 
The remarks — beamed into a small conference room in a 15th-century marble palace in 
a secluded corner of the Vatican — were part of a 50-minute Q&A during a conference 
focused on poverty hosted by the Human Dignity Institute, which **BuzzFeed News** 
attended as part of its coverage of the rise of Europe's religious right. The group was 
founded by Benjamin Harnwell, a longtime aide to Conservative member of the 
**European Parliament** Nirj Deva to promote a "Christian voice" in European politics. The 
group has ties to some of the most conservative factions inside the Catholic 
Church; Cardinal Raymond Burke, one of the most vocal critics of **Pope Francis** who 
was ousted from a senior Vatican position in 2014, is chair of the group's advisory 
board.

**BuzzFeed News** originally posted a transcript beginning 90 seconds into the then-
****Breitbart News**** chairman's remarks because microphone placement made the opening 
mostly unintelligible, but we have completed the transcript from a video of the talk on 
YouTube. You can hear the whole recording at the bottom of the post. 
Here is what he said, unedited: 
Steve Bannon: Thank you very much Benjamin, and I appreciate you guys including us 
in this. We're speaking from Los Angeles today, right across the street from our 
headquarters in Los Angeles. Um. I want to talk about wealth creation and what wealth 
creation really can achieve and maybe take it in a slightly different direction, because I 
believe the world, and particularly the Judeo-Christian west, is in a crisis. And it's really 
the organizing principle of how we built ****Breitbart News**** to really be a platform to bring 
news and information to people throughout the world. Principally in the west, but we're 
expanding internationally to let people understand the depths of this crisis, and it is a 
crisis both of capitalism but really of the underpinnings of the Judeo-Christian west in 
our beliefs. 
It's ironic, I think, that we're talking today at exactly, tomorrow, roo years ago, at the 
exact moment we're talking, the assassination took place in Sarajevo of Archduke Franz 
Ferdinand that led to the end of the Victorian era and the beginning of the bloodiest 
century in mankind's history. Just to put it in perspective, with the assassination that 
took place roo years ago tomorrow in Sarajevo, the world was at total peace. There was 
trade, there was globalization, there was technological transfer, the High Church of 
England and **the Catholic Church** and the Christian faith was predominant throughout 
Europe of practicing Christians. Seven weeks later, I think there were 5 million men in 
uniform and within 30 days there were over a million casualties. 
That war triggered a century of barbaric — unparalleled in mankind's history — virtually 
180 to 200 million people were killed in **the 20th century**, and I believe that, you know, 
hundreds of years from now when they look back, we're children of that: We're children 
of that barbarity. This will be looked at almost as a new Dark Age. 
But the thing that got us out of it, the organizing principle that met this, was not just the 
heroism of our people — whether it was French resistance fighters, whether it was the 
Polish resistance fighters, or it's the young men from Kansas City or the Midwest who 
stormed the beaches of Normandy, commandos in England that fought with the Royal Air

Force, that fought this great war, really the Judeo-Christian West versus atheists, right? 
The underlying principle is an enlightened form of capitalism, that capitalism really gave 
us the wherewithal. It kind of organized and built the materials needed to support, 
whether it's **the **Soviet Union****, England, **the **United States****, and eventually to ta
