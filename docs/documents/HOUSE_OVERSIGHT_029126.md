Terrific; looking forward. 
Excited to go through math candidates on the list, others too. 
Equally important, discuss edits/modifications to the 13 episodes (cutting blahs), expanding math episodes - 
see below. Assuming we expand math episodes, we will need more mathematicians. 
How's late afternoon after **5:30 pm / early evening** today? - or weekend, day/times? (Family issues today - 
mother 102 in May.) 
****Radical Breakthroughs**** - **Initial Revisions** (working model for discussion, red is new) 
Expand and ****Modify Mathematical Breakthrough**** episodes 
1. **Mathematics and Truth / Overview / **Show Excitement**/Importance 
2**. **Mathematical Fields** / **Diverse New Kinds** and Categories 
3. How Math Works in **Disparate Areas** of Knowledge (from fundamental physics to chemistry, 
biology [molecular and evolutionary[, psychology, sociology, economics, etc.) 
4. **Power Laws** 
5. ****Mathematical Biology**** 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029126 
6. **Foundations of Mathematics / Philosophy/Meaning of Math** (discovered/invented?) 
ADD/Exchange to **Biological Breakthrough** episodes 
9/10. ****Replicability Crisis** - Problems** in Statistics in Search for Truth. Deep problems of replicability in 
biomedical and psychological research - the scandal in **recent years**. 
In the non-**Closer To Truth** world.... 
Did **CNN Intl** **This morning** on Trump's China-oil-N.Korea-cheating tweet "Caught RED HANDED..." 
[pun deliberate] 
My favorite fun lines (there are so many) in Trump's **NYTimes** spontaneous interview. 
2) "I like very much **President Xi**. He treated me better than anybody's ever been treated in the history of 
China." 
Ever (-5,000 year history) 
1) "I know the details of taxes better than anybody___better than the greatest CPA." 
Not, mind you, CPAs in general, not even smart Jewish CPAs who work all the time - but whoever, out 
of 664,532 actively licensed CPAs (2016), is the greatest CPA of them all (#1 in citing code? creative 
deductions?) - better than him!

lets talk today. I went through the candidates in math. . we should talk, I have great hopes for this and 
am sure you woudl want to get it right though some of the math people write well , their speakinn style and 
presence is less than A , and probaby closer to a C +/ . Im around today or hte weekend if you would like 
to chat.

`**Blahblahs**' forbidden in '****Radical Breakthroughs****'. So we need two replacements (for Multiverse as Science 
and **Rare Sentience**). 
Initial ideas: 
* Expand the first episode "Mathematics and Truth" into two or likely three episodes. I'm intrigued by this 
because there is so much rich material - pure math, philosophy (discovered or invented), physics (Wigner's 
'unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences)', astrophysics, cosmology, biology, 
general systems theory. I've felt frustrated in this first episode because there is so much material. I think three 
episodes could work - if you agree, I'll get back to you with a suggested structure of the 2 or likely 3 parts. 
Also, **Closer To Truth** has had only a few videos and one episode on mathematics per se (out of 277 
episodes!), so this would be original and complementary. In this may, math would become about half the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029127 
series. 
* **Integrated Information Theory** - quantifying and explaining consciousness (**Giulio Tononi**, Un 
of Wisconsin-Madison), plus supporters and critics. New controversial, science-based radical theory. 
* **Evolutionary Dynamics** - your program at **Harvard** - mathematical models. This is not an area of my 
expertise, but it could well fit **Closer To Truth** in general and ****Radical Breakthroughs**** in particular. But you 
need to tell me if you would like to include this. 
* ****Replicability Crisis** - Problems** in Statistics in Search for Truth. Deep problems of replicability 
in biomedical and especially psychological research - the scandal in **recent years**. See links and attachments.
