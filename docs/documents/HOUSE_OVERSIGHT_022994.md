Thank you for your response. My initial questions are fairly general I believe. 
Was Former Pres Clinton ever a guest on the island? 
Was George Mitchell a guest? 
Would any of the guests get massages from the girls brought by Mr. Epstein or Ms. Maxwell? 
Do you remember 
What was her interaction with Ms. Maxwell? 
How many massages would Mr. Epstein get per day? I understand that the massages happened in a location where, 
based on the article I read, **Ghislaine** instructed you to never go while in use. But I am curious knowing - were the 
massages done by the various young girls brought to the island? Did they appear to be massage therapists? I think I 
know that answer based again on the previous article I read. 
Were you aware of **Ghislaine** flying a helicopter? Flying girls to the island? Flying guests to the island? 
What did you understand **Ghislaine**'s role to be? How did she describe herself or act while there? If she was the 
"queen bee" girlfriend, then what was her explanation of the presence of the other younger girls? And what 
interaction did **Ghislaine** have with those girls? It is our understanding that one of her primarily "jobs" was to find 
the girls to bring to Mr. Epstein but we do not yet have a firm understand where she found them or what interaction 
she personally had with each of them while on the island. I was hoping you could provide some clarity based on 
things you heard or observations you made. 
Again, thank you for any clarification you can provide. I am interested in the facts, including any inaccuracies that 
have been reported in the past which may have given us a misunderstanding of anything. 
Sincerely, 
Brad

Greetings 
Thank you for your letter and sentiments contained there in. 
Cathy and I have read a number of articles that have appeared in the press over **the past few years**. In the cases 
where statements are credited to I can honestly say that we cannot agree to the statements 
made and therefore do not see what further info you need. For example, the notion that we served or witnessed the 
stated alleged acts or parties are untrue. 
If you wish to take this further, please supply a list of questions you think are pertinent and we will then decide if any 
need answering .

Dear Miles and Kathy Alexander, 
I, along with several other attorneys, represent_____________________ She needs your help and we are hoping 
for your assistance. She doesn't need much. In fact, all she needs are some good, honest people who are 
willing to just tell the truth. That seems like a simple request that any compassionate person would 
accommodate; however, for some reason many people have instead decided to stay out of it and allow 
to continue to suffer. A small number of good people have stood up for what is right and told the 
truth. We do not cur
