Claims are ludicrous and self-serving, media is working with the other side's lawyers, this is all about **Donald 
Trump**.

He never tries to explain. He denies, blames media, denigrates someone else.

This thing as model journalism is one more element that could give it legs--so another danger. I don't 
think it's a question now of directly debunking this. That's going against virtue itself What I'd like to do 
is game out everything, creating a structure for thinking this through. Definitely not a piecemeal 
response. Figure out where we want to be and where we can reasonably get and work backwards. 
Maybe we do agree to a big interview with you--**Landon Thomas** or something like that. But this has to 
be war gamed out. Obviously I can contribute, **Kathy** can, would be great to get SB input, but this needs 
a structure, that's why I think Hiltzig or somebody assembling a plan would be helpful. Even if in the 
end you decide to do nothing, at least you've come up with a structured way to think about it.
