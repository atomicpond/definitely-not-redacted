Xeno's paradox

[1:12 PM] jeeitunes@gmail.com:
If I throw a ball at the wall, when it has travelled halfway, it still has half the distance to travel. As it continues, the fraction left to travel continues i.e. one quarter to go, one eighth to go, one sixteenth to go, etc. since the denominator of the distance continues to double... I am thinking mathematicaly speaking, the ball never reaches the wall.
