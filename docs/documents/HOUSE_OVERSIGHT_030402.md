To: ****Michael** Wolff** < 
The **Special Counsel**'s office, nearly leak-proof since its inception **more than a year ago** and seemingly 
immune to the President's constant taunts, might appear to be operating in some parallel universe unmoved by 
the every-day political turmoil. But in the course of conversations I've had recently, as a I research a new book 
on President **Trump** and the forces arrayed against him, what has become clear is that **Robert ****mueller****** and his 
office are preparing for a life or death confrontation with the President and the mother of all constitutional 
crises. 
My discussions have been with both **White **HOUSE**** advisors and people close to the investigation. No source 
involved in this story would speak on the record. 
The sources firmly believe that **Special Counsel** has ready an aggressive legal theory for the indictment of 
the president for obstruction of **Justice**. In the last few weeks, as the President has indulged his pardon 
authority, the ****mueller**** team has also developed a legal strategy to oppose the ikely pardon of former National 
Security Advisor, ****Michael** **flynn****, who had previously struck a plea bargain which could include his testimony 
against the President. 
**Robert ****mueller******, according to one person familiar with the **Special Counsel**'s thinking, could hardly contain 
his disgust when **Rudy **Giuliani****, the President's new lawyer—hired to makes a television case for the President 
and to push back against the ****mueller**** team—in May airily dismissed the notion that a president can be indicted. 
Adding insult to injury, **Giuliani**—who a **White **HOUSE**** source said had likely learned of aspects of the pending 
indictment—said ****mueller**** agreed with that assessment. **White **HOUSE**** sources believe **Giuliani** was daring the 
**Special Counsel** to tip his hand. ****mueller****, in character, contained his outrage and continued to hold his cards 
close as his team finished preparing the obstruction case and refined the legal theories under which it would 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 030402 
claim the right to haul the president into court. 
The ****mueller**** team, according to sources both near the investigation and **the **White **HOUSE******, has prepared a 
case, but it requires the approval of Deputy Attorney General Rod **Rosenstein**, who—with the recusal of 
Attorney General **Jeff Sessions** from the **Russia**-related investigation—oversees the ****mueller**** team. He would 
need to set aside He could do this based on a finding that the former opinion was inaccurate re the president 
being above the law. ttherby creating an inability to indict a sitting president. Indeed, **Rosenstein**, as recently 
as **April**, publicly declared that the President was not a target. This may have been a form of fig leaf to soothe a 
President who regularly demands aides assure him he is not being pursued: the President does not become a 
formal target until **Rosenstein** agrees to designate him as one. 
Any proposed indictment would confront **Rosenstein** with matters with which he has been intimately 
involved. The case, according to my conversations , is fundamentally **Trump** versus the **FBI**, **Justice** 
Department, and ****mueller**** investigation itself. In many ways, it boils down to the word of former **FBI** Director 
**James **Comey**** against the word of Donald **Trump**. **Rosenstein**, at the President's behest, drafted a memo 
justifying the **Comey** firing for how the former **FBI** Director handled the **Hillary Clinton** email investigation. 
But that justification, in an embarrassment for **Rosenstein**, was shortly brushed aside by the President when he 
admitted that he fired **Comey** to disrupt the Russian investigation. What's more, the indictment is said to charge 
that the firing of Andrew McCabe, the former Deputy Director of the **FBI**, who reported directly to **Rosenstein** 
after the **Comey** dismissal, was an instance of illegal retaliation tampering or consipracy by the President 
against a potential witness. 
According to a source with knowledge of the strategy, it will be all the more controversial because if finds 
the entire narrative of the case for obstruction in plain sight. Almost nothing about the cas
