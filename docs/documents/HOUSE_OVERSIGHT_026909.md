The 7.8% intraday peak-to-trough decline in US equities between September 21st and October 11th
has rattled investor confidence. Numerous headlines of stock market “carnage” have further eroded
their confidence. As a result, some of our clients have asked whether this drop signifies the beginning
of the end of a nearly 10-year bull market.
We do not think so. So far, this pullback is actually smaller than the two prior downdrafts we
experienced in late January and in mid-March, neither of which derailed the US economy nor the bull
market. The steady factors we highlighted in our annual Outlook—such as economic growth, benign
inflation, robust earnings, and low probability of recession—have not dissipated. Furthermore, while
the investor focus has shifted to the risks around the unsteady undertow, most of these factors are,
on balance, less concerning today than they were at the beginning of 2018.
Of course, that is not the case across all geopolitical concerns. While trade tensions with Mexico and
1
Canada have abated, those with China have certainly deteriorated and will continue to do so for the
foreseeable future. But, in aggregate, there has been more improvement than deterioration, in our
view.
In this Sunday Night Insight, we will provide a brief update on the steady factors and unsteady
undertow. We then conclude with our view that the steady factors will likely continue to win this tug-ofwar
between the two.
Steady Factors
While the headlines warn of equity market carnage, the facts do not support such alarming headlines.
The S&P 500 is still up 5.1% on a year-to-date total return basis and financial conditions remain at
easier levels today than they did when **the ****Federal Reserve****** began this tightening cycle in 2015,
despite the recent decline in equities and 0.76 percentage point increase in 10-year Treasury yields
year-to-date. Most importantly, as highlighted by ****Federal Reserve**** Chairman, Jerome Powell, we are
in “extraordinary times” of steady growth and low inflation.
Economic Growth
Economic growth remains firm in the US. Both the Institute for Supply Management leading indexes
for manufacturing and non-manufacturing remain at very strong levels. Current activity indicators of
real GDP growth average about 3.5% for the third quarter and closer to 4% for the fourth quarter.
Forecasts for third quarter real GDP average 3.8% and fourth quarter forecasts are about 2.8%.
While growth is slowing from the 4.2% estimate of the second quarter, it is still forecast to be above
trend and we believe a modest slowdown is certainly preferable to continued growth at a pace that
was likely unsustainable and possibly even inflationary.
In aggregate, the economic data since the intraday peak of US equities on September 21st does not
point to any worrisome slowdown in GDP growth or the pace of employment. In fact, while the recent
134K increase in non-farm payrolls was less than expectations, revisions to earlier months offset the
modest headline miss and the unemployment rate still fell to 3.7%. Furthermore, this 134k increase
is above the estimated sustainable level of employment growth based on population growth and
changes in labor force participation, which our colleagues in Goldman Investment Research estimate
is around 96k. Importantly, a modest slowdown in the 3-month average of non-farm payrolls, which
currently stands at a very robust 190k jobs, is more likely to keep inflation in check.
Robust Earnings and Buybacks
Continued above-trend economic growth is supporting solid corporate fundamentals. While many are
quick to dismiss this strength to US tax reform, it is only half the story. Earnings before interest and
taxes (EBIT) expanded by a very healthy 12% in the first half of this year and are expected to grow by
double-digits again in the third quarter. This robust organic profit growth is also fueling sizable
corporate buybacks—a key source of equity market support. Our colleagues on the corporate
buyback desk expect the highest dollar amount for buybacks on record in 2018, with $1tn in
authorizations and $850bn in executed buybacks.

Total Return (%)
Even so, such robust earnings growth has begun to foster concern that we have reached a peak in
EPS growth. While we do expect the pace of growth to slow next year, a local peak in earnings
growth has not signified an imminent peak in the S&P 500 historically. In fact, about 3/4ths of market
peaks occurred **more than two years** after the peak in the growth rate of earnings. Moreover, stock
market returns have remained healthy during this period, with high odds of a positive outcome over
the subsequent 6-24 months (see Exhibit 1). In short, the market u
