Importance: High 
this was just tweeted by famous saudi opposition @mujtahidd.. almost 2 million followers.. 
#**Trump** **MBS** scandal involving President @realDonaldTrump and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman... 
Following @realDonaldTrump's visit to SA, US stance on Saudi affairs changed especially on competition 
between **MBS** & MBN and **Qatar** siege. 
**MBS** = Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (de facto King) 
MBN = Mohammad bin Nayef (deposed Saudi Crown Prince and Interior Minister) 
Prior to @realDonaldTrump, US institutions stood firmly with MBN throughout Obama's presidency. This was 
reaffirmed in a letter to the King. 
After @realDonaldTrump's **Riyadh** visit, he changed the US stance on the **MBS** v MBN power struggle and 
forced the establishment to back **MBS**. 
Past US administrations were keen on avoiding strife within GCC: This is because American interests cannot be 
upheld without a harmonic GCC. 
That was until @realDonaldTrump's return from Saudi upon which **Qatar** siege began and he openly supported 
it contradicting Defence&State Dept 
That was until @realDonaldTrump's return from Saudi upon which **Qatar** siege began and he openly supported 
it contradicting Defence&State Dept 
More bizarrely; **MBS** has a secure direct line to **Trump** like no other leader has - not even Israeli **Netanyahu** & 
British **May**... 
The following story explains **MBS**'s 'special' influence over @realDonaldTrump - even if it means 
compromising **America**'s national interests... 
During @realDonaldTrump's **Riyadh** visit in ****May** 2017** a private yacht discreetly arrived at Jeddah Port; heavily 
guarded and identity hidden. 
Even the Port's authorities were not allowed near it. Only a number of individuals reached it - delivering several 
boxes of cash ($1bn USD). 
After loading the boxes, the yacht disappeared. The operation lasted hours & was kept secret as was yacht's 
identity, origin and destination 
It transpired from **MBS**'s inner circles that the $ lbn was from **MBS** himself & the yacht belonged indirectly to 
@**Trump** Organisation. #**Trump** **MBS**
