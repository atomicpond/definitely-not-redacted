Also think there should be a line in there somewhere which clearly confirms that JE understands and recognizes 
that he did something wrong

Seems very good. Is there reason or opportunity here to evoke JE's **CLINTON** connection? He had been publicly 
connected to the former President and became a proxy for the considerable anger at high levels of the Federal 
government that still surrounded **CLINTON**. Likewise now, one reason to revive the story is that it is a way to tar a 
**Trump** administration official, who, in the normal course of his duties, happened to deal with the case.

Here goes: 
"Sweetheart deal! " So goes the critique of the resolution of a long-ago case involving our former client -- and 
now-friend -- ****Jeffrey** **Epstein****. The critique is profoundly misplaced, supported neither by the law or the facts, 
nor by the structure of our constitutional republic. To the contrary, **Jeffrey** was subjected to an unprecedented 
federal intrusion into a quintessentially local criminal matter in south **Florida**. His offense to the social order --
involving sex for hire -- was entirely a matter entrusted to laws of the several **States**, not the federal 
government. His conduct -- a classic state offense --was being treated exactly that way by able, honest 
prosecutors in ****Palm Beach** County**, but the overweening federal government intruded where it did not 
belong. And now, over **ten years** after the fact, the current assault on federal decision-makers at the time, 
including now-Secretary of **Labor** **Alex Acosta** (then **the United **States**** Attorney in south **Florida**), condemns 
the federal authorities for not going far enough. 
The critics are entirely wrong. Neither the facts nor the law support the misguided criticisms being leveled by 
journalists and politicians at federal officials from over **a decade ago** -- including the highest levels of the 
**Justice Department** in Washington, D.C.. 
Here are the key facts: ****Jeffrey** **Epstein****, a successful self-made businessman with no prior criminal history 
whatever, engaged in illegal conduct that amounts to solicitation of prostitution. That was wrong, and it was 
reasonably viewed as a violation of **Florida** state law. Although no coercion, violence, alcohol, drugs and the 
like were involved, the unsavory facts were carefully assessed by experienced state prosecutors who 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 030315 
aggressively enforce state criminal laws. No one turned a blind eye to potential offenses to the public 
order. To the contrary, the **Palm Beach** State Attorney's Office conducted an extensive **15-month** 
investigation, led by the chief of the Sex Crimes Division. Mr. **Epstein** was then indicted by a state grand jury 
on a single felony count of solicitation of prostitution. 
During that intense investigation, the state prosecutors extensively gathered and analyzed the evidence, met 
face-to-face with many of the asserted victims, considered their credibility -- or lack thereof -- and considered 
the extent of exculpatory evidence. Then, after **months** of elaborate negotiations, the state prosecutors believed 
they had reached a reasoned resolution of the matter that vindicated the public interest -- a resolution entirely 
consistent with that of cases involving other similarly-situated defendants. 
Then, in came the feds. **the United **States**** Attorney's Office tried, to no avail, to fit Mr. **Epstein**'s situation into 
its vision of what it viewed as a commercial trafficking ring targeting minors. This was anything but. At long 
last, the federal authorities acknowledged that stark reality and grudgingly agreed to defer prosecution to the 
state. But there was a huge catch. In the face of our arguments sharply condemning their overreach, the 
federal prosecutors insisted on many unorthodox requirements that tugged at fundamental values of due 
process. For example, the agreement required Mr. **Epstein** to pay an undisclosed list of asserted victims 
$150,000 each. Even more, the feds insisted that **Jeffrey** pay for an attorney to represent such unidentified 
victims if any chose to filed civil litigation against him. When asked what possible legal authority supported 
this extravagant exercise of national power, the feds lamely cited a wildly inapposite case from **Alaska** 
involving cocaine and forced on-the-street prostitution. Apples and oranges. 
Under the federally-forced deal, **Jeffrey** was sentenced to jail. That would not have been the case under the 
agreed-upon state disposition of this non-violent, consensual commercial arrangement. **Jeffrey** comp
