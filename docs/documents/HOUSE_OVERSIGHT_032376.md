**Dear Jeffrey**, 
Since your last meeting in **Paris** and the meeting on site I have had no news from you. I would 
just like to know if you intend to go ahead with the interior design work because **Florence** is 
blocked and waiting. If you want to do it and since about —70-80-90% of the project is 
approved then why don't we start with what is sure and for the remaining points, such as the 
kitchen, we can see about these the next time you are in **Paris**. 
As for the kitchen I understand new samples were sent **yesterday**. These samples are in grey 
which is not a very bright color for a beach **HOUSE** kitchen where perhaps blue might be more 
appropriate. Let's see. 
If you would like us to do the project we will send you a budget recap for the points agreed 
upon along with our first account and fees. 
Big kisses,
