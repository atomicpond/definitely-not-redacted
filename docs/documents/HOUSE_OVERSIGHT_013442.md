﻿Navigating our presidential campaign was a piece of cake compared to understanding the nuances of the 2011 Oscar race for the most revered artistic honor in the world.



This is how nine films fell into the big picture. 



Three premiered in Cannes mid-May, a distant nine months ago, creating an Oscar campaign as long as any human pregnancy.



At the Palais, the first inkling of Oscar buzz was born as reclusive Woody Allen premiered "Midnight in Paris".



PBS later aired a documentary of Woody discussing his forty-four films showing the astonishing depth of his talent that made you want to immediately hand him the Oscar for **Best Picture**. Academy rules and Woody forbade marketing this gem.  



Woody is not a member of the Academy because he doesn’t feel that films should be in competition. He told me, "A statue does not change your life. You still get a cold. You can't get a date. You still have everyday things to worry about". The Academy learned to love him from a distance and gave him best original screenplay as a consolation. 



Terrence Malick's long awaited esoteric "The Tree of Life" unveiled at Cannes and won the coveted " Palme D'Or " positioning it for a nomination. 



"The Artist", created by the French, shot in Hollywood and about Hollywood was the festival surprise. This charming and oddly original black and white silent entry was introduced by the ringmaster himself, Harvey Weinstein. No one could pronounce or spell director Michel Hazanavicius's name. Jean Dujardin could not speak a word of English and neither could his 10 year old co-star, the Jack Russell Uggie who had been rescued from the pound after two adopters found him too wild. Tragically Uggie developed an undisclosed neurological disorder during production, forcing him to retire at the height of his popularity. 



No slam dunk Oscar winner emerged in Cannes. Any future film could easily win.  



DreamWorks’ "The Help" premiered in LA in August and distributer Disney began propelling the politically correct and socially significant film to box office heaven of $200 million. **Viola Davis** and Octavia Spencer were forecast to win Oscars.  



In September, the Toronto and New York Film Festivals and Fox Searchlight presented Alexander s's Hawaiian family saga, "The Descendants," which broke out of the pack with whispers of winning. Beloved George Clooney, playing a father for the first time was hailed a shoe-in for best actor. Directing "Ides of March" was additional momentum.



Also at New York's festival Marty Scorsese and Paramount sneaked an unfinished cut of "Hugo" in Alice Tully Hall, built for concerts but converted into a 3-D theater. Marty was christened the visionary genius of an innovative costly 3-D masterpiece.



Director **Bennett Miller**'s highly anticipated "Moneyball" for Sony hit a grand slam at its west coast premiere in Oakland aligning the film, it’s heart throb star Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill and seasoned writers Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin in play.



Spielberg's epic "War Horse" for DreamWorks came thundering down the pike with a huge premiere back at Alice Tully Hall with posters of Lincoln Center's Tony winning theatrical "War Horse" with their indelible puppets in the background. Steven paid homage to legends John Ford and David Lean and the country fell in love with a horse named Joey and his fourteen stand-ins.



Studios worked their stars to the bone. Ironically, Harvey's independent French talent who lived in Paris were not as available as their competitors, therefore Uggie became a super star igniting a pet war.



Christopher Plummer, who had best supporting actor in the bag promoted his Jack Russell, Cosmo. Diminutive Scorsese was seen on TV on a small couch with his large Doberman, Blackie drooling on his suit. Spielberg never got a chance to trot out his lead horse Joey, previously seen in "Seabiscuit" because his ravishing reddish coat was now darkened for another role. 



By December, as film critics bestowed their own awards upon many films, Stephen Daldry struggled to finish "Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close" with a new score. There was buzz Daldry could be editing the winner. Producer Scott Rudin juggled his astounding three films in one year from Daldry, Miller and David Fincher directing “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.”



Daldry had received three consecutive directing nominations. In January, for his fourth film, he received a **Best Picture** nomination, for a boy's emotional journey dealing with 9/11, and the nine films were officially off and running. Forty-five film and media groups handed out awards leading up to Oscar night.



Wednesday, February 22



My airplane seatmate to LAX was Sony Classics **Michael Barker**. The night before Woody Allen had shown Michael "Nero Fiddled", his latest film shot in Rome rumored to be his best.  



When Woody won the Oscar Sunday night, for a record breaking 23rd overall nomination, he had just finished pasta a Sette Mezzo on Lexington Avenue
