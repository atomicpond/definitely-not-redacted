"That Russian oligarch who spent that money on that property and never moved into it and ultimately tore it 
down, he's also a large shareholder in a bank called the Bank of Cyprus, which has been implicated in Russian 
money laundering. The chairman of the Bank of Cyprus is the former CEO of **Deutsche Bank**, to which **Donald 
Trump** owed all that money at the time he conveniently got this very large influx of cash from a Russian guy. 
The vice chairman of that bank until recently was our new secretary of **Commerce**, long time Trump friend, 
**Wilbur Ross**.
