HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023208

To: Melanie Spinella <________________________> 
Leon, 
Yesterday , I again spent hours upon hours of my time with your office. ,( speak to brad to get 
flavor) and you and i will discuss the results in gory gruesome detail on Friday. it mirrored many other 
weeks spent doing the things that I don;t have the time to do. 
In order to keep things in perspective, maybe reviewing an analogy I have used before with you, 
might be helpful. You and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500 
million dollars per year. It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments, 
in various categories , a desire to enter into others. A panoply of loans, notes. purchases, wide range 
of all types of taxes. , planes. boats homes. . trusts ,grats. a crazy number of bank accts. ( with no 
oversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 800 page tax returns, foreign firms. art consultants. 
construction consultants bill payers, home mgmt.,vast multitude of llc's , including foreign, and with 
all that you only have a combined overhead of less that 3 million dollars. 
I have previously sent you the very same note that i have enclosed again below ,this time with 
highlights . I wrote it to you over a year ago. As my acute disability ( selective memory) seems to 
have been raised as one of your concerns , as a rule I try to memorialize things in writing in an 
attempt to lay out issues that I fear may later turn out to be a problem. ie what i would and wouldn't 
do , - my responsibilities. etc and those things that are not, below you will find details of things that I 
thought needed to be done, so that you wouldn't find yourself in the very 
```
