﻿                    Does Trump Fit the Evolutionary Role of Narcissistic Sociopath?

                    Nathan H. Lents and **Robert Trivers**

There is no shortage of published psychological profiles of Donald J. Trump that attempt to diagnose him, from a distance, as either a psychopath or a narcissistic sociopath. These profiles, of course, are fatally hindered by the lack of access to Mr. Trump for personal examination and completion of personality inventories. However, exploration of the evolutionary features of these very peculiar personality types may provide insight into this important question. 

Psychopaths are indeed an evolutionary conundrum because their particular behaviors are not an obvious path toward evolutionary success. For example, the majority of serial killers are childless when they are killed or apprehended. Narcissistic sociopaths, however, invariably [typically] have families and children whom they support energetically, and many of the traits specific to this phenotype can fairly be called adaptive. This raises the important issue of the evolutionary niche of a narcissistic sociopath within the societies in which they exist. 

The psychological profile of narcissistic sociopathy is generally agreed upon and shares many features with psychopaths including above average intelligence, considerable social savvy, adaptability, likeability, and natural skills in the manipulation of others. They are charming, outgoing, and often feign interest in people and subjects and can convincingly fake both sympathy and conscience. If they engage in charitable acts at all, they are only in pursuit of ancillary selfish benefits. They learn well from past experiences, and show no dedication to a set of moral values, religious beliefs, truth, transparency. If they admire anyone, it is other sociopaths that they wish to emulate. Finally, they are effective liars and show a chilling unconcern for the welfare of others.

There is one particular skill that is common to both psychopaths and narcissistic sociopaths and absolutely essential to their nature: cognitive empathy. Emotional empathy, sometimes called emotional contagion, is regarded as the ability and tendency to closely identify with the emotional experience of others, even “catching” their emotions to a degree. Cognitive empathy is quite different. This is a mental skill involving the close observation and interpretation of the actions and emotions of others in order to understand and predict their behavior. It is morally neutral and common in high-functioning individuals across the moral and ethical spectrum. While social workers and therapists use cognitive empathy to help individuals improve their lives, psychopaths and sociopaths use this skill to manipulate, coerce, and deceive others in order to achieve their own ends. While emotional empathy is an innate cognitive feature we share with most social mammals, cognitive empathy is a skill that can be developed and refined and doing so is key to the behavioral patterns of both psychopaths and sociopaths.

However, the ways in which sociopaths differ from psychopaths is key to understanding their evolutionary utility. For example, psychopaths are more likely than the general public to be violent and to end up incarcerated. Narcissistic sociopaths, on the other hand, are usually nonviolent and happy to work within a system of laws and norms, insofar as it suits their goals, because, while they do not hesitate to harm others, it isn’t a specific aim. Instead, they are highly motivated toward the accumulation of riches and influence; whereas psychopaths are often motivated toward sadistic self-gratification and generally do not seek positions of power and wealth per se. (There is some crossover between these phenotypes and sociopaths who do find gratification in hurting others are labeled malignant sociopaths.) Finally, narcissistic sociopaths always seek reproductive success through procreation and aggressive nepotism, which is usually accompanied by extreme in-group identification, e.g., racism, xenophobia, and nationalism, while psychopaths show no allegiance to family, community, or country.

Therefore, the phenotype of the narcissistic sociopath is not a bizarre combination of traits, but rather a set of highly attuned social skills and behaviors aimed at increasing long-term biological fitness through wealth, status, power, and the future success of progeny. In order words, sociopaths are highly adapted. The evolutionary puzzle is not found in the phenotype itself but rather in the interaction of sociopaths with the society in which they exist. Social groups can detect dishonest and manipulative behaviors and act to punish the actors in order to either correct the antisocial behavior or remove them from the group. Dozens of mammal species have shown this very sophisticated and elastic social behavior, but humans and our close relatives are especially apt at detecting and punishing cheaters, f
