In case you’re interested, President-elect Donald **Trump** meets today with a a group of doctors at his Mar-a-
Lago resort in **Palm Beach**, **Florida**.
They are Dr. John H. Noseworthy, president and chief executive officer of the Mayo Clinic; Dr. Paul B.
Rothman, dean of the medical faculty, vice president for medicine of The Johns Hopkins University and chief
executive officer of Johns Hopkins Medicine; Dr. **Bruce Moskowitz**; Dr. David F. Torchiana, president and
chief executive officer of Partners HealthCare; and Dr. Toby Cosgrove, president and chief executive officer
of **the **Cleveland Clinic****.
**the **Cleveland Clinic**** has lots of patients, but a notable one is U.S. Rep. Tom Marino, R-10, Lycoming Twp.,
one of Mr. **Trump**’s top supporters, who has undergone kidney cancer surgery there.
None of the doctors gave to Mr. **Trump**’s campaign and generally don’t contribute much to political
campaigns if at all. When they do, they donate mostly to Democrats.
Mr. **Trump** is also meeting with Isaac Perlmutter, chief executive officer of Marvel Entertainment, and David
M. Rubenstein the co-founder of **Carlyle Group**.
Mr. Perlumuter hardly ever gives to political campaigns either, but his wife, Laura, gave $2 million to former
presidential candidate **Marco Rubio**’s campaign super PAC, according to **the New York Times**.
Mr. Rubenstein gives extensively to candidates from both parties.
Neither he nor Perlmutter gave to Mr. **Trump**.

**Trump** just met with superinfluential
health-care
executives you’ve probably never
heard of
By Ariana Eunjung Cha December 28 at 1:20 PM
President-elect Donald **Trump**'s meeting **this month** with Silicon Valley's elite made
headlines for its inclusion of such big names as **Apple**'s Tim Cook, **Facebook**'s Sheryl
Sandberg, Tesla Motors's Elon Musk, and **Amazon**'s Jeffrey P. Bezos. (Bezos owns The
**Washington Post**.)
The group talked about a wide range of topics, including bringing jobs back to
**the **United States****, immigration, China, cybersecurity, taxes and technology in schools.
What has been less publicized is that **Trump** has been holding similar meet-and-greets
with other titans of industry in critical areas of the economy, including finance
and network news.
On **Wednesday**, his guests were health-care executives — many of whom represent
companies or institutions that have a big stake in the outcome of **Trump**'s ambitions to
dismantle the Affordable Care Act. According to a pool report, the group, all men, met
with him at 11 a.m. at the Mar-a-Lago estate in **Palm Beach**, Fla. They included John
Noseworthy of the Mayo Clinic, Paul Rothman of Johns Hopkins Medicine, David
Torchiana of Partners HealthCare and Toby Cosgrove of **the **Cleveland Clinic****.
Noseworthy, a neurologist who is president and CEO of the Mayo Clinic, in recent
years has been an articulate commentator about health-care reform on TV shows such
as MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” NBC's “Meet the Press,” and “**Charlie Rose**.” He has
argued that **Obamacare** was basically an expansion of insurance coverage and did not
emphasize patient health enough.
In an interview with **the **Washington Post**** in **November**, he said his office had already
