**Hi Jeff** 
I really find it amusing. I don't agree with everything he says. But it is fascinating. BB is making "historic 
mistakes"(as he likes to blame others) both vis-a-vis Obama as well as in regard to the American Jewry. And 
causes a direct damage to IL. 
Noam is so sharp and focused. Really impressive. 
I did not fully understand how the fallacy he sees in the attitude to the Ants example is related to Big Data 
illusions. An area (deep learning) I spent some time recently trying to better penetrate. 
Btw, the series of cubic differences should look 7,19,37,61 (not 21). 
We greatly enjoyed staying in 62nd. 
We plan to be back in the last week of Aug. for **several weeks** (having some speeches to make) 
will you still be in NM? 
If positive we might come over for **few days**. 
PI let us know.

From Nil as well.

Neat indeed. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025893 
I'm writing about the **Iran** deal. So far have only sent a form paragraph in response to requests. Below. 
Noam 
On **Iran**, as usual, I'm a gloomy contrarian. I'm glad the treaty was signed, and it's kind of fun to watch the 
Republican lunatics shrieking hysterically as they try to kill it (as they may). And Israeli hypocrisy has gone 
well beyond being comical. But in fact the whole thing is farcical, in my opinon. In the US, **Iran** is "the 
greatest threat to world peace", intoned constantly from on high, in the media, everywhere. There is also such a 
thing as world opinion, as measured by such ultra-radicals as **Gallup**. It turns out that the greatest threat to 
world peace is the US, by a very wide margin, no one else even close, and **Iran** barely mentioned. The 
American population is protected from these unwanted facts by the **Free Press**: not reported. There is an 
organization called US intelligence. They brief Congress regularly on the international security situation, all 
quite public. On **Iran**, they point out that it has very limited military power, even by regional standards (a small 
fraction of ****Saudi Arabia****, for example). Its strategic doctrine is defensive. If— a big If— it has plans for nuclear 
weapons, that would be part of its deterrent strategy. Now who would be opposed to **Iran** having a deterrent 
strategy? Answer is clear: the rogue states that rampage violently in the region and don't want any impediment: 
the US and **Israel**, also lesser ones like UK and **France**. One simple way to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons 
would be to establish a nuclear-weapons free zone in the region, as has been done elsewhere (over US 
objections). That's been advocated by the Arab states for **20 years**, with very wide global support, including 
**Iran**. It comes up regularly at the **5-year** review meetings of the Nonproliferation Treaty, at the UN, again a few 
months ago, when, again, it was blocked by the US to protect its Israeli client, which has a huge nuclear 
weapons arsenal and wants to keep it. Again, the population is protected from such facts by the **Free Press** 
(though in this case there are some fringe exceptions, and of course the Arms Control literature). Same with the 
rest of the litany. Reading the US and UK press is like living in some lunatic asylum. I'm wondering whether 
to write about it — again; have done so repeatedly. It's like talking to a wall. **Iran** has an awful government, 
though by the standards of such US allies as ****Saudi Arabia****, it's practically heaven. 
Nevertheless, better to have the treaty than not to, given the nature of the asylum.

the mathematical model. is quite beautiful, though the basic rules are simple , once they have run over and 
over again, and produced a result you cannot tease them out by any form of reductionism. or 
algorithm, just like the series 7- 21 -37... cannot be found by alogrithm, it is simply the difference of 
cubes, . Have you written about the **Iran** deal?

What you suggest is very much the model that has been current in the behavioral sciences for many years. It has a 
record of colossal failure, and for good reasons, I think. It's disproven, but keeps coming back, most recently with Big 
Data illusions.
