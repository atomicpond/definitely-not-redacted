p rince Andrew also fares poorly in the wake of Epstein's 
imprisonment. 
The two men are old friends. They have been ever since 
**Ghislaine Maxwell** introduced the prince to her then-beau, some-
time in the 1990s. In 2000, Epstein had been invited to Windsor 
Castle to celebrate the queen's birthday. **Six months later**, Epstein 
flew to Sandringham, the queen's estate in Norfolk, England, for 
a party Prince Andrew threw for Ghislaine's thirty-ninth birthday. 
The prince had also visited Epstein on several occasions, in 
Palm Beach as well as in New York. And if allegations Virginia 
Roberts made in her 2015 declaration are to be believed, Epstein 
asked her to give the prince whatever he required, then report 
back with the details. 
According to the Guardian, Epstein and the prince had par-
tied together at Windsor Castle, in Saint-Tropez, and in Thailand,

where "Andrew was pictured on a yacht surrounded by topless 
women." 
According to Roberts's lawsuit, Epstein had forced her into 
the prince's bed on Little Saint Jeff's. 
After Epstein's conviction, the British press were using another 
name for Little Saint Jeff's: Sex Island. The Guardian reported 
that the manager of two **Virgin Islands**—based corporations owned 
by Epstein happened to be the wife of the governor of the Virgin 
Islands. There were allegations involving a million-dollar dona-
tion that Epstein had made to the governor's reelection cam-
paign. And then there was Roberts's claim that she had been 
forced to have sex with the prince on the island as well as in 
New York and in London. 
Invariably, the photograph of Prince Andrew with his arm 
around the bare midriff of a very young-looking Virginia Rob-
erts ran with stories that appeared in the tabloids. 
"It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form 
of sexual contact or relationship" with Roberts, Buckingham 
Palace spokespersons would say. "The allegations made are false 
and without any foundation." 
The prince's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, 
while on a skiing trip with the prince and their daughter Euge-
nie in Switzerland, told reporters, "He is the greatest man there 
is. It was the finest moment of my life in 1986 when I married 
him. He is a great man, the best in the world." 
"I won't stand by—because I know what it feels like to have 
salacious lies made up about you—and not support him so pub-
licly because they are just shockingly accusatory allegations,
