The following two airports are in the inner core, inside lONM **Tfr**. 
**PBI** Airport; All General Aviation traffic into **PBI** must clear **TSA** designated "Gateways" for both arrival and 
departures into and out of **PBI**. Departure Gateways - We expect the Gateways to be established at the multiple 
locations at **PBI** with **TSA** operating from 0800-1700 and requires prior reservation (24hrs) with **TSA**. Arrival 
Gateways — Expect Ft. Lauderdale International Airport (FLL) and Orlando Int'l (MCO). Also expecting 
**Teterboro**, Dulles, and White Plains as additional gateways. 
LNA Airport; As initially established by the USSS, the **Palm Beach County** Park Airport (LNA) in Lantana, 
FL will be closed to all departures and flight training. Only arrivals into LNA that have gone through the **TSA** 
Gateway program at one of the designated airports (FLL/MCO) may fly into LNA during the **Tfr**. 
The 30NM outer core will also be in effect and measures will be posted in the **FAA** NOTAM/**Tfr** release.
