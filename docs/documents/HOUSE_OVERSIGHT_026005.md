****August 11**, 2016** 
A federal jury decided **Thursday** that one of **the **Middle East****'s most prominent banks did not commit fraud and 
steal technology from an **Irvine** firm that sued it for half a billion dollars in damages after their partnership 
collapsed. 
**Orange County** company **InfoSpan** had alleged that ****Emirates** NBD** ended a partnership for a mobile payment 
system because it didn't want to share revenue and stole **InfoSpan**'s technology to launch its own service. 
The **Dubai**-based bank, in turn, denied it stole or ever used **InfoSpan**'s technology. It argued that it cancelled the 
partnership because **InfoSpan** couldn't produce a working product and misled it into thinking it was an 
established company, not one with little to no track record. 
After deliberating for **a day**, the jury unanimously decided that **InfoSpan** did not prove its case of fraud and theft 
of trade secrets. 
**InfoSpan** had asked for $540 million in damages. An attorney for **InfoSpan** declined to comment on the 
possibility of an appeal. 
The verdict capped a **two-week** trial that involved dueling accusations of fraud levied by high-profile attorneys 
on both sides, including the former ****White House**** counsel to **President Obama**. 
At the center of the high-stakes battle was San Juan Capistrano resident and entrepreneur **Farooq Bajwa** and a 
mobile payment system that he said would allow migrant workers in **the **Middle East**** to send remittances back 
home through text messages. 
Bajwa contended that **InfoSpan**, with support from outside investors, spent $87 million developing the business 
and technology. 
To launch the system, known as **SpanCash**, Bajwa partnered in 2007 with ****Emirates** Bank**, which is controlled 
by the United Arab **Emirates**' sovereign wealth fund. 
It seemed the ideal collaboration for the Pakistani immigrant, who earned millions operating another **Irvine** 
company that manufactured computer components in **the 1980s** and **1990s** 
The Gulf States rely heavily on migrants to work construction and other low-wage jobs, offering a ready-made 
market for **SpanCash**. **InfoSpan** aimed to allow migrants to transfer money back home far more cheaply than 
**Western Union** or hawala, a traditional **Middle Eastern** broker-to-broker money transfer system. 
A study from McKinsey & Co., cited in court records, projected **annual** revenue of $3.5 billion by the deal's 
**fifth year**, with **InfoSpan** receiving more than $2.8 billion in fees. 
But the relationship between **InfoSpan** and ****Emirates** Bank** soured and the bank cancelled the deal in 2009. 
**A few days later**, **Emirates** filed a criminal complaint in **Dubai** against Bajwa and a partner alleging that they 
defrauded the bank and misrepresented **InfoSpan** as an established business with a working technology. 
**Two years later**, **InfoSpan** sued in U.S. ****District Court**** in **Santa Ana** and alleged that its technology was working 
and that it delivered its source code to the bank on servers. **Emirates** ended the deal, **InfoSpan** said, to launch its 
own mobile payment system after stealing **InfoSpan**'s technology. 
In court, an attorney for **InfoSpan** argued that **Emirates** torpedoed the **InfoSpan** relationship because it abhorred 
how much money it would have to share with the **Irvine** firm. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026005 
"They wanted **SpanCash** and they wanted the money," attorney William A. Isaacson said in his closing 
arguments **Wednesday**. 
Isaacson — a partner with powerhouse law firm ****Boies Schiller** & Flexner**, chaired by high-profile litigator David 
Boies — argued that the bank resorted to "pure extortion" in an attempt to get its way. 
As a result of the bank's criminal complaint, **InfoSpan** alleged Bajwa's partner, **Larry **Scudder****, was detained at 
the **Dubai** International Airport and taken to a cell where he was locked in with 30 other men for 19 hours until 
he secured his release by turning over his passport. 
According to the lawsuit, Bajwa tried to resolve the situation but was told **Scudder**'s passport would be released 
and he could leave the country only if **InfoSpan** gave up ownership and control of **SpanCash** to the bank. 
**Six months later**, the bank withdrew the fraud accusations and **Scudder** got his passport back, but **SpanCash**'s 
reputation was tarnished and it collapsed, Bajwa previously told The **Times**. 
The bank disputed that it acquired **InfoSpan**'s source code or used it at any time. 
Former ****White House**** counsel and an attorney for the bank, Kathryn Ruemmler, said that **Emirates** never would 
have acquired source code in a joint-partnership deal like the one reached with **InfoSpan**. She said such 
technology would instead be held by a third-party escrow company for the length of the partnership. 
In her closing arguments, the partner with global firm Latham & Watkins told the jury that Bajwa and **InfoSpan** 
sold the
