Tonja--
**the National **Enquirer**** is preparing to publish a story that **BILL** Clinton used a private "orgy" jet to travel to 
Brunei for an extraordinary dinner with a royal accused of duping American women into "white slavery." 
The **Enquirer** will report that **BILL** was accompanied by the 727's owner, billionaire pedophile **Jeffrey **Epstein****, 
when he landed in the tiny South-East Asian country on May 25, 2002. His entourage also included two 
women who allegedly worked as "madams" for **Epstein**, luring teenaged girls into sex trysts with the tycoon 
and his powerful and famous friends. 
According to The **Enquirer**'s investigation, **BILL** spent the day playing golf at a seven-star hotel -- and then was 
invited to dine with Brunei's sultan, Hassanal Bolkiah .....who was charged with holding a deeply-religious 
Christian beauty queen as a "human chattel." Far from being embarrassed by the ruler's tawdry 
reputation, moreover, records for **BILL**'s nonprofit foundation reveal that Brunei made a donation towards his 
Clinton Presidential Library that year of between $1. million and $5 million. 
Please kindly attempt to provide any comment by 4 pm ET tomorrow, Friday January 30th to Lachlan 
Cartwright, Executive Editor, at [Office] or 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 031994 
Thank You,
