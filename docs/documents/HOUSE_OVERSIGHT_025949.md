Subject: Re: Mechanisms for learning 
Importance: High 
Some thoughts I meant to send back for a long time: 
no worry, if i understand correctly you are suggsting there are layers 1 through N . lets cal them L 1 - 
Ln. there are times T 1- Tn / and then conjecture that changing the time . correlations ( by genetic swtch or 
other method. , you might be able to make blacks smarter by changing the time for motor layer 
development and changing the time for other layers. . ). like telemeres for the cell , are their equivalents for 
the layers. . as you talked about culling the unused neurons in each layer, each neuron in each layer would get 
dfferent ( kill yourself if you are not being used instructions ). 
Exactly. I looked up the statistics, black kids in the US have slower cognitive development (and never catch 
up), which the study of course attributed to social factors without any evidence, and they had faster motor 
development! I suspect this means their brains are slower at learning high-level concepts, because the low-level 
structures are optimized for a shorter time. But they will keep the lead in motor development, because it is 
easier to learn, and they have more time and attention to practice once they get the structures in place. 
It could also be that they have an additional set of learning directives in place that adapts them better to a more 
hunting/running style of life, whereas the Europeans had to adapt for identifying long-term seasonal patterns, 
delayed gratification for agriculture etc. 
and CONCEPTS could be layer to layer communicaiton. . are gender differences also a matter of time , and 
structure of interactions. . 
I suspect gender differences are mostly motivational, i.e. we have a reward system for all the different social 
and cognitive needs, which makes us receive different kinds of pleasure and pain, thereby pay attention and 
learn. You cannot learn what does not attract your attention. Women tend to find abstract systems, conflicts and 
mechanisms intrinsically boring. Most women in computer science do not write programs because they enjoy 
solving puzzles, but because they want to help people, get approval etc. There are almost no women in math, 
because it does not help people or yield social attention. 
Men tend to find elaborate social relations boring. If there is no pleasure in observing and empathizing with 
people, one will not have good social cognition. 
IQ is not the only meaningful difference. Chinese pay an inordinate amount of attention to authority. I suspect 
historically., the authorities tended to kill them a lot if they did not. Jews tend be intellectually independent and 
anti-authoritarian, which might make them creative and inventive in ways that are hard to find in **Asia**. 
At the moment, I think speed/quality of brain development plus motivational system are the key to 
understanding both mind and individual differences. Important part of human language might be the result in a 
motivational need to discover/invent grammatical structure, which as a side effect makes us interested in music. 
It would mean that Chomsky's life long hypothesis, that people have a special circuit for grammatical language, 
is wrong. They might be GENERAL learners, just like Gorillas, but with a strong motivational urge to build 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025949 
grammatical structure, which the brain simply invents (there are only a few ways in which a natural language 
can work). That is much easier to wire into a brain than a specific circuit. 
i my self believe that african music, westrn music , chinese music are a window into the the structure of those 
layers. . western rigid, african primitve , chinese nature based, . I belive that synphoic movments best 
describe your layering, they open with a basic simple melody„ after it is learned, it is repeated and" 
developed" , inverted, distorted, related, etc. the development stage take a long time. then there is a 
recapitlaltion of the whole. and its inter and intra actions. . african musci has lots of beats. and little 
development. - no accident, it mirrors their learning process. 
Interesting question if music is somehow indicative of genetically defined prefs, but I am not sure. It could be 
path effects, starting in culture. 
re taboo 
, maybe climate change is a good way of dealing with overpopulation. . the earths forest fire. potentailly a 
good thing for the species 
Making having children expensive in terms of upbringing and missed opportunity (like in the west) is a more 
humane way. Environmental stress while leaving near rock bottom tends to lead people to have more children, 
because there is no missed opportunity, and high mortality requires more attempts at procreation. Humans are a 
hardy species, outside of focused famine events and wars only small fractions of any given population die. 
I suspect that strong reductio
