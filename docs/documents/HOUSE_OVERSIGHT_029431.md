****Jeffrey** Epstein** [jeeyacation@gmail.com] 
thank you to friends of **Poetry** in **America** 
poetry_logo_cmyk_light-bgjpg 
Importance: **High 
Dear **Jeffrey****: (and please see personal P.S. under my signature!) 
I am writing now, as I have for **the last several years**, to update you on the work that **Poetry** in **America** and ****Verse Video Education**** have done in the 
**last year**. Below, I detail the accomplishments of 2017 and, below that, some projects I hope to complete **In 2018**. But first: my deepest thanks to you 
who have contributed financially, intellectually, creatively, and in so many other ways to **Poetry** in **America**'s work. 
Some of you receiving this letter have generously supported ****Verse Video Education****, the independent non-profit production company (a 501c3) I 
founded in 2015. ****Verse Video Education**** now partners with **WGBH** television as well as with ******Harvard** University**** (and others) to make the highest 
quality educational media for broad audiences. Whether you supported me by sharing your own interpretive talents on camera or by helping me to 
land elusive talent; whether you provided me funding, or equipment, or business wisdom, or organizational advice, 
or a space in which to film, or just plain interest in the work-- I am immensely grateful. Making media-- and especially television-- is complex, and 
expensive, and I could not have navigated the road from professor to professor/producer/director without you. 
Others of you have supported my humanities work at **Harvard**, and, in particular, **Harvard**'s efforts to provide distance education of all kinds. Now 
(along with partners at the Bok Center, HarvardX, the Graduate School of Education, and the Extension School), I produce educational content for a 
wide global community of learners. Increasingly, **Poetry** in **America** not only distributes state-of-the-art humanities content within and beyond 
**Harvard**'s gates, but we also train, mentor, and support a growing number of **Harvard** undergraduates and graduate students with interests in 
education, media, and the public humanities. These students now comprise a vibrant community of young **Harvard** humanists gaining experience in 
online teaching, curriculum design, educational policy, international education, video production, video editing, and more. By supporting **Poetry** in 
**America**, you 
also support forward-looking humanities education at **Harvard**. (Update: those of you who are alumni of ******Harvard** College**** are now eligible to receive 
class credit for your donations to **Poetry** in **America** projects.) 
It's thrilling for me to report that our two largest efforts of **the last few years** are both coming to fruition. 
**Poetry** in **America**'s 13-episode television series, along with its parallel PBS LeamingMedia Collection for educators, will air on PBS stations 
nationwide beginning in **April 2018**. Click here for a sneak peek at our 90-second series trailer (password: Poetry90). Featuring such guest 
interpreters as those in the trailer-- and dozens of others-- each half-hour episode of the series offers a deep dive into one important American poem. 
Discussions on a second season have begun! 
Meanwhile, our **Harvard** partners at the Extension School and the Graduate School of Education have agreed, for a limited time, to make the full 
suite of **Poetry** in **America** online courses accessible to learners all over the world, offering a steep reduction in course fees. Students and teachers 
worldwide can now take any **Poetry** in **America** course-- at any credit level-- for $200. (Take a look at our 2018 offerings here.) Those of you who 
support individual schools or school networks: please note that through 2018 groups of five teachers or students can take any **Poetry** in **America** 
course for $1000 and receive graduate, undergraduate, or professional development credit-- and, that group's facilitator can receive free tuition. 
Please feel free to distribute our offerings to educators whose work you support anywhere in the world. 
**Harvard**'s highly unusual decision to slash tuition for **the next year** follows the great success of **Poetry** in **America**'s first course for educators--
**Poetry** in **America** for Teachers: The City from **Whitman** to **Hip Hop**. In recognition of this course, **David Coleman** (president of **the **College Board****) 
has offered support to allow us to continue developing and providing access to the highest quality educational and professional development 
humanities content. **In 2018**, as I lay out below, we seek to expand the scope of our offerings, and to work with our many partners to broaden access 
to all learners. 
Thank you for your support for this work, and warmest best to you all in this holiday season. 
Sincerely, 
Lisa 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 029431 
P.S. and thank you so much, **Jeffrey**, for your amazing support, without which much of what I've managed in **the last few years** would never have 
happened. My next course for teachers„ as you'll notice, has shifted from art to environment--n
