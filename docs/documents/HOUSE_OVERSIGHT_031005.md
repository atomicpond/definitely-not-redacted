Hi **Darren**: 
I hope you are well. 
Since we are no longer working for **Jeffrey**, I'm forwarding this ****daily** News** request to you so you can handle it as you see 
fit. 
Many thanks,

**Howard**: 
We're working on a story for our **Sunday** column about ****Jeffrey** **Epstein****. I thought I might send 
my questions to you tonight, so you'd have them first thing **tomorrow**. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 031005 
Would you like to comment on the following: 
1. You've said that the women pressing suits against Mr. **Epstein** "have lied repeatedly, and in 
no way shape or form were they victims. They were at his place freely and voluntarily. And one 
of them showed **Epstein** a fake ID." What do you have to say now that Mr. **Epstein** has 
admitted in his federal plea bargain that he did conspire to entice minors to engage in 
prostitution? Accepting that these women came voluntarily, isn't Mr **Epstein** still guilty of 
statutory rape? 
2. **Brad Edwards**, an attorney who represents three of the women, recently served a 
**Subpoena** to Testify at a Deposition on **Epstein**'s former girlfriend, **Ghislaine** 
****Maxwell****. The **Subpoena** asks that ****Maxwell**** produce "a list of all girls" that visited 
******Jeffrey** **Epstein****'s** homes in **Palm Beach** and **Manhattan**, or flew on his 
planes. Edwards said in an interview that ****Maxwell**** was "second-in-command of 
**Epstein**'s criminal enterprise." He added, "She was on **Epstein**'s plane, transporting girls 
for the purpose of having sex with other people. She kept a computer database of hundreds of 
girls and oversaw the schedule of girls who came to **Epstein**'s homes." 
3. A suit filed **last May** by "**Jane Doe** 102" against **Epstein** alleges that, after recruiting her as a **15-
year-old** girl to give **Epstein** massages, ****Maxwell**** and **Epstein** took part in "sexually assaulting, 
battering, exploiting, and abusing Plaintiff." 
4. The same suit alleges that **Epstein** "lured" the girl "every day for **next two weeks**" to his 
**HOUSE**. The suit claims that she eventually became a "sex slave" to **Epstein**, traveling with him 
around the world. "In all of these locations, she was required to engage in sex acts with him and 
other women - including other minors." 
5. Did **Jane Doe** 102 — who now lives in **Australia** — go on the **2002** trip where 
President **CLINTON** flew on Mr. **Epstein**'s **Boeing** 727? 
6. "Most of these acts of abuse occurred during a time when defendant [**Jane Doe** 102] knew 
that the plaintiff was approximately 15, 16 and **17 **years** old** and, after **years** of **daily** sexual 
exploitation continued into her adulthood ... until she fled at **age 19**," 
7. When ****Maxwell**** and **Epstein** celebrated **Jane Doe** 102's 16th birthday with her, **Epstein** joked that 
he would have to "trade her in" because she was getting too old for him. 
8. Not only was **Jane Doe** 102 required to satisfy **Epstein**'s "every sexual whim," but she also was 
exploited by **Epstein**'s adult male peers. They included "royalty, politicians, academicians, 
businessmen and others in various locations around the world." 
9. **The **Palm Beach** Post** and lawyers representing **Epstein**'s alleged victims have called his federal 
non-prosecution agreement a "secret," "backroom," "sweetheart" deal, noting that none of his 
alleged victims was consulted. Several critics have claimed **Epstein** "bought" the agreement, using 
politically-connected lawyers. Would he like to comment? 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 031006 
10. Is **Epstein** cooperating with federal suit against **Bear Steams** hedge fund managers **Ralph Cioffi** 
and **Matthew Tannin**? Willhetestifyintheircases? 
11. Mr **Epstein** was deposed on **this week**, on **Thursday**. Is it true that he answered almost every 
question by invoking his FifthAmendmentrights? 
12. Defense attorney **Brad Evans** has filed a motion to freeze Mr **Epstein**'s assets. Has Mr. 
**Epstein** moved his money from the US offshore or abroad, or does he intend to, in order to 
protect his assets from possible damage claims? 
13. What did Mr. **Epstein** do during his work release program while serving time. Reports have 
said he engaged in "scientific research." If so, what was he researching? 
14. Has Mr. **Epstein** returned to pursuing his investment business? Is Mr **Epstein** still on 
probation? 
15. Is Mr. Epsteinpermittedto leave FloridaortheUnited Stat
