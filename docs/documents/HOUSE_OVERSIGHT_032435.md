"What they would like to say to their friends is, 'Look, I have a butler, an English-style 
butler in my home,' to show how wealthy they are," said Neal Yeh, a Chinese-born 
Briton living in **Beijing**, who for **over **a decade**** has helped train and find jobs for 
butlers. 
"The country now with the biggest trend in butlers is **China**," said Mr. Yeh, whose 
English accent would be at home on "Downton Abbey," the television series about a 
blue blood family in **England**, which was avidly watched in **China**. "I dare say I have 
played a part in starting this trend." 
Butler training schools and agencies have been doing business in **China** for more than 
**a decade**, but the number of recruits has grown sharply in **recent years**, according to 
those in the business. Most are Chinese and many are women. The International Butler 
Academy **China** opened in **2014** here in Chengdu, a haze-covered city in southwest 
**China**, and offers a six-week boot camp on dinner service, managing homes and other 
minutiae of high living. 
"The Chinese are vacationing more now 
than ever in history, and so they're being 
exposed to the **West** more and more," said 
Christopher Noble, an American trainer at 
the academy who previously ran bars in 
**Cleveland**. "But Chinese people see that, 
experience top-class personal service 
abroad, and they want to experience it 
here."
