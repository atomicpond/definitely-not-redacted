the talks are pretty far along.”
Greenpoint Technologies is currently

from **Boeing** and installing the center’s
StandardAero in Springfield, Ill. does major
refurbishment on large- to small-cabin jets.
“Anything that can be done with an interior, we do
in Springfield,” says StandardAero’s Scott Taylor.
Aeroloft rest area in each before further
delivery of the airplanes to other completion
centers for outfitting.
The Aeroloft is located in the area
above the main deck and aft of the
upper-deck, forward lounge in the
executive 747. It was designed, engineered
and is built by Greenpoint. The
center is licensed by **Boeing** to do the
necessary modifications and installation.
It will receive EASA certification
**this year** and adds 393 additional sq
ft to the 4,786 ft in the main deck and
upper lounge.
Sloan Benson, executive v-p at
Greenpoint, said interest is growing in
the Aerolift elevator it designed for the
747-8. “We’re expecting to book one
**later **this year****.”
Greenpoint has contracts to modify
three more 747-8s for the Aeroloft. Two
of them, like the first two, will go on to
other centers for installation of the Aeroloft
kit and for the full interior completion.
A fifth green 747-8 will arrive
**next year** and remain at Greenpoint for
full outfitting. It will be the **KIRKLAND**,
Wash. center’s first green completion
of a twin-aisle airplane, an appropriate
way to mark Greenpoint’s 25th anniversary
in the business.
Gore Design Completion delivered
two twin-aisle airplanes in 2011: a 767 to
a central Asian head of state and a 777.
Kathy Gore Walters, co-founder and
president, said the company expects to
deliver its first BBJ3 in June for a Middle
East client, and in **the same month** to turn
over an ACJ320 for a central Asian client.
**later **this year****, Gore design expects also
to deliver two ACJ340s.
Pats Aircraft Systems continues to
install its FAA-certified auxiliary fuel systems
in BBJs. “We’ve done more than 140
aux fuel systems installations on behalf
of **Boeing**,” said senior v-p of sales and
marketing John Eichten.

**SkyTheater** TAKES MOVIES TO THE MAX
**earlier **this year****, a flying theater rolled up
to the Signature FBO on Teterboro Airport’s
south side in the form of a Global Express
XRS equipped with an entertainment system
called **SkyTheater**. With it came **SkyTheater**
founder Gregg **Launer**, 52, a friendly bear of a
man who tries for modesty but whose enthusiasm
spills close to hubris when he describes
the custom-built entertainment package as
being to the average movie experience what
Sofia Vergara is to simply being female. **Launer**
is something of a likeable version of Steven
Jobs. His knowledge in the world of sound is
such that he frequently stops and searches his
vocabulary for language that the average listener
will understand. And frequently failing,
he will offer an apology and start over. In his
own circle, he is often described by clients as
a genius. To lesser human beings, his thoughts
seem to run like a pinball through the random
light and sound of an arcade game, with a purpose
difficult to recognize.
“I’m a true audiophile, and what I’m
building is a sensory experience that will so
completely absorb my clients that it becomes
reality and they lose themselves in the world
that the director or cameraman or composer
**SkyTheater** founder Gregg
**Launer** put nearly 1,000
movies into a Global
Express Avod.
created,” he explains. “I
build every system as if it
were going into my own
airplane. I want to impress
even myself, and I’m my
own worst critic.”
His earliest memories
are of music and theater
and lying awake in
bed and listening to legendary
DJ Cousin Brucie
lay down a cascade of rock and roll on **New
York**’s powerhouse WABC. Even **decades**
later, one of his favorite toys at home is a
Rock-Ola Jukebox. “When you listen to Dean
Martin, or Elvis, or Chuck Berry on a jukebox,
you’re hearing rock and roll the way it was
made to be heard,” he avows.
And he recalls a summer when his parents
took him on vacation to the Deauville Beach
Resort in **Miami Beach**, where The Supremes
were performing. “They were in the room
across the hall from us, and Mary Wilson and
Flo Ballard shared a cabana next to ours. I was
too young to attend the show, but the resort
manager had mercy on me, took me by the
hand and put me in the front row.”
By **the age of 18**, **Launer** held a first-class
radiotelephone license from the FCC and by 19
was an audio engineer producing music tracks
at NBC in Miami. And along the way, he also
indulged what he describes as his alternative
passion of flying, picking up his private license
and going on to become a flight instructor.
At the age of 32, he and wife, Blanche,
formed a company that ****two years** later** became

**SkyTheater**. And as if life had determined to
create a movie script for him, **Launer**’s first customer
and later
