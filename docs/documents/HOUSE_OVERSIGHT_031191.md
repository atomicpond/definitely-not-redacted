______• May 20, **1997** 
**Donald Trump's** instincts regarding **Jeffrey **Epstein**** were solid. Rut if 
the reporters who were beginning to look into **Epstein**'s mysterious 
background had dug a bit further, there's a chalice they would have hit 
pay dirt as well—and not just in **Palm Beach**. 
In **California**, for instance, a paper trail already stretched from the 
Santa Monica Police Department to **Epstein**'s front door. 
In **the spring**—almost the summer—of **1997**, a call came in to the 
police. The young woman who placed it—a young actress who'd 
appeared on Baywatch and General Hospital—said she'd been sexually 
assaulted at a trendy hotel called Shutters on the Beach. 
The officer who took the call knew the woman's name—
and her voice. A week earlier, she'd told him about an encounter with 
**Epstein**. The worliall had not wanted to make a formal complaint at the 
time. But she had taken the cop's card, and now he was happy to hear 
that she'd changed her mind. 
In a shaky voice, described **Epstein** as a tallish man—five feet 
eleven or six feet in height was her guess—with gray hair and brown 
eyes. He was the owner of a large black four-door **Mercedes** and was a 
regular at Shutters on the Beach, which was the kind of place that cost 
one thousand dollars a night and was frequented by actors, agents, and 
other **Hollywood** types. 
told the cop that she was a model and actress herself. She'd 
known Epc;i0in for **about a month** They had a friend in common, and 
she'd sent him her head shots.
