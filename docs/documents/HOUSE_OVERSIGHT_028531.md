**Summers** withdraws from **Fed** race 
**Lawrence **Summers**** has taken himself out of the running to be the next chair of 
**the **Federal Reserve****, withdrawing his name after opposition from key Democratic 
senators indicated they would oppose his nomination. 
Mr **Summers**, a former ****Treasury** Secretary** and senior economic adviser to 
**Barack Obama** in his first term, galvanised opposition among left-of-centre 
Democrats who painted him as symbol of the wrongs of financial deregulation.
