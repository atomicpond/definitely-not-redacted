Importance: High 
China's big tech stocks have fallen into a bear 
market at the same time that regulatory threats 
against U.S. big tech companies are gaining 
momentum. Can U.S. big tech stocks soldier on 
alone or is this a harbinger that the group as a whole 
is losing its tremendous leadership position?

In **recent months**, China's BAT collapse has demonstrated how costly the expectation of 
invincibility can be—Baidu, **Alibaba**, and **Tencent** are all down more than 24% 
from their **year-to-date** closing highs. **Citigroup**'s head of Asia strategy, Mohammed 
Apabhai, told CNN an apt analogy about the investor sentiment that led to BAT's collapse, 
likening "the exuberance for tech stocks to the Looney Tunes cartoons in which Wile E. 
Coyote chases Road Runner over a cliff." Given they've more or less moved in 
tandem for years, will FAANG follow the same path as BAT? 
Source: Stockcharts.com 
The BAT collapse was triggered by subpar earnings and a shifting regulatory environment 
in China. **Facebook**'s miss in 2Q18—which drove a $120 billion single-day market cap 
loss, the biggest ever for a U.S. company—showed how decisive a turn could be if more 
U.S. tech darlings stumble **this quarter**. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032806 
There are mounting fundamental reasons to question the 3Q18 earnings 
prospects of FAANG, from the accelerating user backlash against **Facebook** to Apple's 
trade war exposure to **Amazon**'s rapidly-intensifying workforce revolt that could see the e-
commerce giant left with no option but to raise wages and improve workplace conditions 
for its warehouse and ****Whole Foods**** employees. 
However, as Apabhai suggests, the message BAT is sending is less about earnings, and 
more about the cost of exuberance. And FAANG exuberance faces threats that go beyond 
fundamentals. A flurry of regulatory announcements **last week** signaled the 
political tide has turned in the U.S. Across every branch of government, the 
message was consistent: the U.S. no longer trusts tech giants to self-
police. And the public agrees—according to a Gallup poll **last month**, 79% of 
Americans now believe "tech companies should be regulated the same way 
the news media is." 
Regardless of political will, threats may not turn to action in the near term. Nonetheless, 
FAANG appears increasingly vulnerable to a decisive sentiment shift. At some point, the 
relentless barrage of bad news will force investors to begin pricing in regulatory risks. Any 
sustained stumble by FAANG's leadership could cripple exuberance, and cause an 
unraveling of passive and algorithmic strategies that are heavily overweight tech 
(see W/LTWApril 7, 2018 for more). We will continue to watch closely to estimate 
timing, but given SAT's collapse, today more than ever, acute scrutiny of tech 
giant leadership is required. 
Through August 28, **Amazon**, Apple and **Microsoft** had accounted for greater than 35% of 
the S&P 500's total return **this year**, according to S&P **Dow Jones** Indices data. It took 
**Amazon** just 165 trading days to grow its market value from $600 billion in **January** to $1 
trillion. The combined market cap of FAAMG (**Facebook**, Apple, **Amazon**, **Microsoft**, and 
**Google**) now sits over $4 trillion, or roughly equal to the combined market cap of the 283 
smallest S&P 500 members. 
Tech's continued market leadership means investors have largely discounted 
the mounting risks tech giants face. We have been warning about the downsides of 
tech giant monopolism for **more than two years** in these pages, from surveillance/data 
security concerns to anticompetitive behavior and their role in escalating inequality. For 
the political establishment, for the media, for the public, **this year** has seen a 
broad awakening—the ****Cambridge** Analytica** scandal, the backlash against **Jeff Bezos**' 
astonishing wealth, and tech's ever-skyrocketing market caps were all warning signs. The 
past month signals a new phase has begun: from a distant rumbling of change 
to preparation for action. 
The number of significant tech-related regulatory developments that have emerged from 
the U.S. and the E.U. in **recent weeks** is nothing short of staggering. Here is an 
abbreviated list: 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032807 
• **President Trump** attacked **Google** for liberal bias, and claimed **Google**, **Facebook**, 
and **Amazon** represent "a very antitrust situation". 
• Attorney General **Jeff Sessions** convened a meeting of Republican state 
attorneys general to discuss whether tech giants "may be hurting competition and 
intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms." 
• **Facebook**, **Twitter**, and **Google** were called to testify in front of the House and Senate 
about election interference, political bias, etc. **Google** declined to attend.
