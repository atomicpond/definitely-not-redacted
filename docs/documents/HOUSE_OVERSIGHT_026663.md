REGULATORY & COMPLIANCE ALERT 
FEBRUARY 15, **2017** 
TIC Form **shc** Deadline Approaching - Form Deadline is 
March 3, **2017** 
The U.S. Department of the Treasury recently released a revised Form **shc**. Form **shc**, which is part of 
the Treasury International Capital ("TIC") data reporting system, is the mandatory **five-year** benchmark 
survey of the ownership of foreign securities by U.S. residents. Absent an announcement of a delay 
from the **Trump** administration, the report is due to the **Federal Reserve Board** of NY ("FRBNY") by March 
3, **2017** for data reportable as of **December 31**, **2016**. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 026664 
All U.S. resident custodians and end-investors with holdings of foreign portfolio securities above the 
reporting thresholds must report. In addition, all U.S.-resident custodians and end-investors that are 
notified by the FRBNY are required to file a report. 
The reporting threshold for Schedule 2 is $200 million in total fair value of all foreign securities owned 
by the **shc** Reporter and not held with a U.S.-resident custodian. The reporting threshold for Schedule 
3 is $200 million in total fair value of foreign securities held with any one unaffiliated U.S.-resident 
custodian that is not a central securities depository. 
Custodians are all organizations that hold securities in safekeeping for other organizations. Most U.S.-
resident custodians also invest in foreign securities for their own account. U.S.-resident custodians 
should report both the foreign portfolio securities held in safekeeping for other U.S. residents and their 
own foreign portfolio securities. 
End-investors are U.S.-resident organizations that invest in foreign securities for their own portfolios or 
invest on behalf of others, such as investment managers/fund sponsors. This includes securities that are 
held-for-trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity. U.S.-resident end-investors include, but are not 
limited to: 
• Financial and non-financial organizations 
• Managers of private and public pension funds 
• Managers/sponsors of funds, country funds, unit-investment funds, exchange-traded funds, 
collective-investment trusts, hedge funds or any other similarly pooled, commingled funds. Also 
managers/sponsors of private equity companies, venture capital companies, hedge funds and other 
private investment vehicles 
• Insurance companies 
• Foundations 
• Institutions of higher learning 
• Trusts and estates 
• Funds and similar entities that own shares or units of, or other portfolio equity interests in, 
a foreign related or non-related entity 
Form **shc** is comprised of three schedules: 
Schedule 1 - Must be filed by all entities thati) receive a copy of the **shc** forms and instructions 
from the FRBNY, or 2) are notified by the FRBNY that they are required to file the **shc** report. 
Schedule 1 requests information that identifies the reporter. It also provides contact 
information, indicates the reporting status, and summarizes the data, if any, reported on 
Schedule 2 and/or Schedule 3. 
Schedule 2 - Used to report detailed information on foreign securities owned by U.S.-resident 
investors (1) that the reporter safe-keeps for itself or for its U.S.-resident clients or (2) for which 
the reporter directly employs foreign-resident sub-custodians or U.S.-resident or foreign-
resident central securities depositories (CSDs) to manage the safekeeping of those securities 
(Foreign securities in safekeeping with U.S.-resident CSDs are reportable on Schedule 2.) or (3) 
that are instruments of the type that there is no U.S. custodian to manage the safekeeping of 
those securities. 
Schedule 3 - Used to report summary amounts for all foreign securities entrusted to the 
safekeeping of a U.S.-resident custodian, excluding those entrusted to a U.S. - resident CSD.

Completed reports may be submitted to the FRBNY on paper or electronically through the Federal 
Reserve Reporting Central System. Additional information and a copy of the Form SCH are available
