ELISA NEW 
Powell M. **Cabot Professor** of **American Literature 
November** 25, 2018 
Dear **Ms. Williams**: 
Tel: 
Fax: 
I am writing now to invite you to be a featured guest of Poetry in **America** 
(poetryinamerica.org). Poetry in **America**'s first season's guests included **Bill 
Clinton**, **Joe Biden**, **Cynthia Nixon**, Shaquille O'Neal, **Yo Yo Ma**, Samantha 
Power, **Herbie Hancock**, **John McCain**, **Nas**, **Angela Duckworth**, **Bono**, **Regina 
Spektor**, **Frank Gehry**, **Stuart Weitzman**, **E.O. Wilson** and many others. Seasons 
Two and Three will feature just as distinguished a line up. The series airs on 
public television stations everywhere, streams via ****Amazon** Prime** and other 
streaming services, and it is now also airing on a variety of domestic and 
international airlines. 
The poem we'd read and interpret together is by **Pulitzer Prize** winner, Sharon 
Olds, and it's called "The Language of the Brag." It's a gutsy poem that 
compares feats of (male) athletic prowess-- and feats of poetic prowess-- to 
childbirth. You are the ideal reader for this poem. We would use what we 
filmed together in upcoming season of Poetry in **America**. I'll also use the 
content in an online course for medical professionals I am creating in 
partnership with ******Harvard** Medical School****. 
I thank you for considering this request. I would be very honored to work 
with you. 
Sincerely, 
Elisa New 
Director and Host of Poetry in **America** 
Powell M. **Cabot Professor**, **Harvard**
