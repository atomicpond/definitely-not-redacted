Subject: Re: 
Importance: High 
Absolutely. **23rd** is great. I teach my seminar that day at 1 but could tape in the morning or after class--in my 
office (very private), or at the Harvardx studios (less) or in the Woodberry poetry room (the nicest place). . If 
**Woody** wanted, we could bring some students into the taping or just do the two of us... 
**Woody** is absolutely welcome to come to the seminar, of course 
**John McCain**, **Tony Kushner**, **Al Gore** have all signed on the last 2 days...crazy
