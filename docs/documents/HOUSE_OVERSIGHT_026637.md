My Thoughts on Currencies 
Stephen L Jen (London) 
November 29, 2016 
Bottom line. Some retracement in the market trends we've seen since 
November 8 makes sense, in light of the magnitudes of the moves as well as 
the upcoming event risks (Italian referendum, OPEC meeting, and the 
FOMC meeting). But I think none of these events will likely surprise the 
markets, and President-Elect Trump will likely continue to drive the 
markets, extending the recent trends. By the way, he has left the US 
****Treasury** Secretary** post last to be filled, and it is the most important 
appointment for the markets as it will both reflect and influence key policies 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026637 
on trade, tax cuts, and infrastructure spending. (1) The doves at the Fed 
have been silenced as, under **President Trump**, the US policy mix will likely 
be less lop-sided and the emphasis will be on Arrow 3, with Arrow 1 being 
downgraded. I think the effective demotion of the Fed has just begun. Its 
independence will likely be challenged, as it should be, in my personal 
view. November 8 marked the beginning of the end of the financial 
repression in the US. (2) Generating outsized economic growth will be key 
to settling several important inconsistencies in macro. I will elaborate on 
this point below. But the market trends witnessed since November 8 will 
not be sustained unless **Mr Trump**'s policies indeed lead to significantly 
higher nominal GDP growth. (3) The mainstream media remain negative on 
**Mr Trump**, but this will keep the hurdle low, and in turn pressure President 
Trump to deliver early in 2017 and thus for him to impress favourably. A 
shift away from identity politics, in my view, based on my personal 
experience from **Taiwan**, should lead to positive economic 
progress. Investors won't need to wait long for there to be more concrete 
announcements on the various parts of Arrow 3, including both the content 
of the policies as well as their sequencing. (4) FWIW, my two policy 
recommendations to the reformers are (i) design an effective global taxation 
scheme to properly tax multi-national corporations and (ii) adopt industrial 
policies to help countries focus on their comparative advantages. The US, 
UK, Japan, and Italy are all prime candidates to do (ii). (5) The dollar is 
already moderately over-valued, but this will not prevent it from 
strengthening further, especially against the EM currencies. Think in terms 
of 'growth alpha' and 'growth beta.' Much of EM, including China since 
February of this year, have not possessed 'growth alpha' and have continued 
to rely on 'growth beta' vis-à-vis the rest of the world. I struggle to think of 
key reforms that EM countries have embarked on in **recent years**: even 
countries like **France** and Italy have undertaken more reforms than most EM 
countries. Squeezed by (i) a more hawkish Fed, (ii) a China that will 
continue to soft land, and (iii) a potentially more inward-looking US, EM 
will struggle without 'growth alpha.' I think we may be entering into a 
period of differentiation among the EM markets: those that have 'growth 
alpha' will be rewarded while those that continue to rely on 'growth beta' 
will not. (6) The world according to Trump will be more Darwinian for 
countries and less Darwinian for US citizens.This notion applies to investing 
in EM, to countries' growth prospects, and to international competition — 
(potentially) very different from **the last few years**, when 'the Fed was the 
only game in town' and everyone and everything floated higher by central 
bank liquidity... In any case, the dollar should be in a good position to 
thrive, I think. 
Economic Olympics. The markets are no longer driven only by the Fed and 
central bank policies, but by forward-looking policy inclinations. The 'false 
economy' that central banks have nurtured will gradually be replaced by real 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026638 
economies. In my view, **Mr Trump**'s victory will have many social, 
geopolitical, and economic consequences, but for investors I think he will 
start a period of 'Economic Olympics', whereby the federal governments 
around the world will take more responsibility and be more proactive to help 
their 'national
