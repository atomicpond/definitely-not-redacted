average humans is the wrong term. it is humans that are distributed think ant colony.( workers soldiers etc 
) not average ant. no such thing. in isolation

general intelligence so hard to get from human brains?

Cells seem to be mostly indistinguishable (except for XX), I thought? 
Size is different on average, but males with small brains are still male. 
Variation of all traits is higher for males, so there are more high IQ men (wider **Bell**-curve). Given average 
brain size difference, the small difference in average IQ is surprising, I think 
gender differenece. unlikely motivational, every cell is different. size is didfferent. . 
the more radical idea is that brains are the nucleus of the human" cell: the body the membrane, . the 
organizm the colletcions and interactions of brains, wisdom of crowds . mirroring. etc. . money 
used as signals. as is spoken language. . what does social behavior mean, it is the cooridiation of indiv 
brains. = 
I think that mathematics based thinking does not allow for censorship. money people concepts if they 
are all math , then poliiical correctness and their structures are only subsets of a larger group of 
thoughts. its not emotinal for me. 
most people have censorship built in at a deep level, social reasoning gets to different results than equivalent 
abstract reasoning

Some thoughts I meant to send back for a long time: 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 026413 
no worry, if i understand correctly you are suggsting there are layers 1 through N. lets cal them L 1 - 
Ln. there are times T 1- Tn / and then conjecture that changing the time . correlations ( by genetic swtch 
or other method. , you might be able to make blacks smarter by changing the time for motor layer 
development and changing the time for other layers. . ). like telemeres for the cell , are their equivalents 
for the layers. . as you talked about culling the unused neurons in each layer, each neuron in each layer 
would get dfferent ( kill yourself if you are not being used instructions ). 
Exactly. I looked up the statistics, black kids in the US have slower cognitive development (and never catch 
up), which the study of course attributed to social factors without any evidence, and they had faster motor 
development! I suspect this means their brains are slower at learning high-level concepts, because the low-
level structures are optimized for a shorter time. But they will keep the lead in motor development, because it 
is easier to learn, and they have more time and attention to practice once they get the structures in place. 
It could also be that they have an additional set of learning directives in place that adapts them better to a 
more hunting/running style of life, whereas the Europeans had to adapt for identifying long-term seasonal 
patterns, delayed gratification for agriculture etc. 
and CONCEPTS could be layer to layer communicaiton. . are gender differences also a matter of time, 
and structure of interactions. . 
I suspect gender differences are mostly motivational, i.e. we have a reward system for all the different social 
and cognitive needs, which makes us receive different kinds of pleasure and pain, thereby pay attention and 
learn. You cannot learn what does not attract your attention. Women tend to find abstract systems, conflicts 
and mechanisms intrinsically boring. Most women in computer science do not write programs because they 
enjoy solving puzzles, but because they want to help people, get approval etc. There are almost no women in 
math, because it does not help people or yield social attention. 
Men tend to find elaborate social relations boring. If there is no pleasure in observing and empathizing with 
people, one will not have good social cognition. 
IQ is not the only meaningful difference. Chinese pay an inordinate amount of attention to authority. I 
suspect historically., the authorities tended to kill them a lot if they did not. Jews tend be intellectually 
independent and anti-authoritarian, which might make them creative and inventive in ways that are hard to 
find in **Asia**. 
At the moment, I think speed/quality of brain development plus motivational system are the key to 
understanding
