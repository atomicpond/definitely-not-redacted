Hi**.. so, here is the event I am still invited to give in **Germany**. It is Oct 19th. I was previously invited to give a 
major lecture in **Heidelberg** Oct 14 but they had to cancel it after the university determination re **Australia** was 
publicized by the bitch. That air ticket, which they had paid fo, was about 5250 euros. There is a $900 
cancellation fee, and they have agreed to let me keep the ticket if I pay them 4500 euros. I offered that to the 
other place but they only have $5K USD total, which includes the $4K fee they originally offered me. I am 
going to check other tickets now, but wanted to know if you might be flying to **Europe** around then and could 
take a hitchhiker. :)

Hi **Lawrence**, 
just back from a long tour ,,on origins". 
As promised you will get my message promptly. 
As you may understand, before we start recruiting for the Festival our budget 
implies more freedom. Now I simply do not have the flexibility to decide so easily 
on amounts in „kilos". (especially as a prominent Nobel laureate shortly before 
deadline agreed to come and implied a pretty large sum). 
What I can offer you is 5k as a lump sum. This is the ultimate at the moment. 
I deeply regret these limitations but I cannot ignore redlines. 
So please let me know if you can or cannot come. 
As ever **Jakob**

Hi.. update.. noam cannot do anything anyway.. nor UK that week.. So, I have been able confirm I can get the 
ticket for the discounted amount of 4500 Euros.. Are you game with my proposal? I have until end of Sept to

Well it depends on UK.. if they can't do it, then alas, it would be the whole thing.. I could check for a discount 
ticket of course.. and maybe even economy class... There is also a small chance that I might do the event in UK 
with **Noam Chomsky**, and I am wondering whether, if I could convince him to join me in a dialogue at your 
place whether that might change the dynamics of the event for you, and free up some more money perhaps..

Hi **Jakob** 
There has been a complication. The Gottingen event had to be cancelled so that means I now do not have an air ticket to **Germany**. I 
am going to check whether I can arrange anything in the Uk which might cover part of the cost for a new ticket. In the meantime I 
thought I should let you know and ask whether it is possible to cover part or all of the cost for a ticket.
