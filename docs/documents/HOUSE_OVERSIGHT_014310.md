Navigating post-**Trump** volatility 
• We are recording unprecedented divergences in falling equity **Vol** with rising rates **Vol** post **Trump**'s win. Intra-
day **S&P** realized **Vol** collapsed from near 60% to below 20% in 2d [Chart 1] 
• While equities have shown less conviction over what a **Trump** win means (given strong sector rotation), the 
bond market has sold off with one of the largest moves in history [Chart 2 & 3] 
• Stabilizing rates volatility from here is key to markets remaining calm and while equity upside may continue, it is 
not without higher risks 
• We like cheap optionality to hedge long-equities if rates continue to move sharply 
For investors long equities, we look at ways to cheapen protecting from downside risks in the event of further bond 
market volatility catalysed by **Trump** policy uncertainty  
• Buy an **SPX** Apr-17 95% put conditional on US 10Y **CMS** > 2.5% at maturity for 0.87%
