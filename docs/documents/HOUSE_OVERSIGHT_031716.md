What **the **Middle **East****** Needs
Now from **America**

For **decades**, the U.S. has pursued misguided policies.
At pivotal moments in our history, **America** has courageously
concluded that a central tenet of its foreign policy, conceived with the
best intentions, simply isn’t working. Hard though it’s been for this
proud and mighty nation to admit failure, trading a losing strategy for
a fresh course has brought such triumphs as the **Nixon**-Kissinger pacts
with **China** that isolated **the Soviet Union** and helped to end the Cold
War.
**today**, **America** faces just such a reckoning in **the **Middle **East******. Our
objective is clear: halting the spread of terrorism that’s headed for our
shores, threatening mass murder in our suburban shopping malls, city
tunnels, and crowded parks. With **the **Middle **East****** in chaos—as though
a raging desert sirocco is destroying all sense of order––the US should
make a radical, historic shift in its outreach towards the Arab world.
Given the reluctance of **America** and its Western allies to launch a
military offensive, it’s impossible to know when peace will be restored.
But right now, while the battles rage, the US can take decisive
diplomatic steps to stem the poverty and despair that makes the
**Middle **East**** a breeding ground for radical Islamic terrorism. **America**
should forge alliances with a new generation of Arab leaders whose
principal goal is improving the daily lives of their people. Providing
jobs and raising hope among the region’s impoverished youth is the
best protection for the world’s wealthy nations, from **America**, to
**Europe**, to the Arabian Peninsula.
Once peace is restored, the US should take the lead in establishing a
21st century “Marshall Plan” of economic aid to durably lift living
standards in **the **Middle **East******’s poorest areas.
So what went wrong? For **decades**, the U.S. has pursued a misguided
policy I’ll call “embrace and abandon.” It started with the “embrace:”
recruiting and financing leaders who were blatantly autocratic, yet at
the time qualified as **America**’s allies. Then, the U.S. invariably
exhorted these strongmen to champion revolutionary democratic
reforms in the name of “nation building.” Yet the newly-installed
regimes owed their existence to denying freedoms that would rally
dissidents to overthrow them. So the democratization **America**
encouraged was doomed from the start.
Then came the “abandon.” Time and time again, when the
governments **America** had nurtured and praised faced resistance or
rebellion, **Washington** deserted their leaders, citing the popular excuse
that their repressive measures were enslaving their own people.
Supporting leaders when they kept **the **Middle **East****** stable, then
dumping them when they failed to adopt Western ideals, was a
blueprint for disaster. And it’s disaster that ensued. Many of those
strongmen––from Mubarak in **Egypt** to **Gaddafi** in **Libya**––have
fallen. Once dominated by repressive but stable nation-states, vast
swaths of **the **Middle **East****** are now borderless, a hodge-podge of
territories controlled by warring factions that’s a throwback to its
tribal past.
The search for a solution to this chaos requires a clear understanding
of how we got here in the first place.
For **centuries**, the Ottoman Empire had neutralized the historically
rooted sectarian divisions within **Islam**. Those divisions stem from its
ancient political legacy as a “caliphate,” a religious state with united by
military might, but with constantly shifting borders. Following the
Ottoman collapse after World War I, European colonial powers
assumed the role of regional administrator, and colluded to redraw
boundaries (i.e. Sykes-Picot) in the Middle-**East** to create nation states
that satisfied competing Western interests. Those newly-created
nations, occupying territories defined by legal borders, ignored Arab
history and tribal custom. Modern Western notions of distinct nations
bound together by geography, language, self-determination or political
ideals been relevant in the Arab world. To Arabs, tribe and religion
always trump an imposed political structure, especially the Westernexported
concept of the nation-state.
Following World War II, as European colonialism waned, the US
assumed a more significant role in **the **Middle **East******. US foreign policy
was driven primarily by oil interests, the protection of **Israel** and
resistance to Soviet aggression. To prevent the region from dissolving
in sectarian conflict, the US established a series of autocracies. The
campaign included restoring the Shah of **Iran** to the throne after the
