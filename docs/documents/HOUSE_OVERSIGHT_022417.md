November 23, 2015 
Dear Partner, 
I hope this letter finds you well — please see the below updates on the Park Mansion: 
I am happy to report that we have completed the building's demolition stage. I have included a 
few photos for your reference. 
Furthermore, we are very close to filling our building permit and we have finalized our design 
for the units. Please see the attached plans. The team is finishing interviews with General 
Contractors (GCs) and has come down to the final five GCs that will be allowed to bid on the 
project. 
Additionally included are visuals for the sidewalk shed and a rendering for the website. 
Please fell free to contact me if you have any questions at 
Thank you so much for your trust and friendship,
