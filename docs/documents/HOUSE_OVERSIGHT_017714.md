I. Introduction
**Crime Victims** are virtually absent from **the **Federal Rules** of Criminal Procedure**. The sixty **Federal Rules** comprehensively
cover every aspect of federal criminal proceedings - from initial appearance through preliminary hearing, arraignment,
acceptance of pleas, trial, and sentencing. Yet the rules substantively mention victims only once, briefly recognizing the right
of some victims to speak at sentencing. 1
The **Federal Rules** can no longer leave victims unmentioned. In October 2004, Congress passed and **President Bush** signed into
law the Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila Lynn **Crime Victims**' Rights Act (CVRA).
2 The CVRA transforms **Crime Victims** into participants in the criminal justice process by (among other things) guaranteeing
them notice of court hearings, the right to attend those hearings, and the opportunity to testify at appropriate points in the
process. These new victims' rights will reshape the federal criminal justice system and force significant changes to the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure to reflect the victim's expanded role. **This Article** offers comprehensive proposals for changing the
**Federal Rules** to both implement the CVRA and reflect sound public policy. The CVRA dictates changes like these to the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure because only by integrating victims into the **Federal Rules** will Congress's goal of making victims
participants in the process be fully realized.
**This Article** is divided into five parts. Following this introduction, Part II reviews the current absence of victims from the
**Federal Rules**. Surprisingly, even where the rules cover issues of great concern to victims, victims somehow go unmentioned.

**Crime Victims**' Rights Act, Pub. L. No. 108-405, 118 Stat. 2261 (2004) (codified at 18 U.S.C.A. 3771 (West 2004 & Supp. 2005)). The
CVRA was part of a much larger piece of legislation that addressed a variety of subjects, known as the "Justice for All Act." See generally
Steven J. Twist, On the Wings of Their Angels: The Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, Nila Lynn Crime
Victims' Rights Act, 9 Lewis & Clark L. Rev. (forthcoming 2005).

Part II then discusses the **Crime Victims**' rights movement and concludes with a brief sketch of the events leading to the CVRA's
enactment.
[*838] Part III discusses why it is necessary to amend the federal criminal rules to incorporate victims. Although the CVRA is
a federal statute that automatically trumps any conflicting procedural rule, procedural rules drive day-to-day courtroom
practices. Given that Congress was particularly concerned about integrating victims into the fabric of the criminal justice
system, the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules should amend the rules to directly reflect the CVRA's requirements.
Part IV provides a rule-by-rule analysis of the changes needed in **the **Federal Rules** of Criminal Procedure** to implement the
CVRA. Of particular importance is new language protecting **Crime Victims**' rights to be notified of and to be present and heard
at public criminal proceedings. Congress should also implement the right to notice in a new rule mandating that prosecutors
keep victims apprised of criminal proceedings. In addition, the rules should also reflect victims' rights to attend court
proceedings and to testify at bail, plea, and sentencing hearings. Part IV also discusses other significant chan
