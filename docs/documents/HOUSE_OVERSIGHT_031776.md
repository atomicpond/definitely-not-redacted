﻿EXTORTION – AVANATTI


How Avenatti May Have Crossed The Line Into Extortion

Law360 (March 26, 2019, 9:52 PM EDT) -- **a day** after being accused of trying to extort **Nike**, attorney and President Donald **Trump** antagonist Michael Avenatti was on the offensive **Tuesday** with allegations of corruption on the part of the company, but those counterpunches likely won't help him **Dodge** federal charges that he went beyond hardball advocacy.

According to prosecutors, Avenatti pressed **Nike** to pay him millions of dollars as an "internal investigator" in addition to the much smaller figure he demanded from the sports gear giant for his youth basketball coach client.

The lack of nexus between his client's alleged injury at **Nike**'s hands and Avenatti's demand for eight-figure fees as an investigator puts the allegations well beyond the realm of aggressive posturing and into the parameters of federal extortion statutes, said criminal defense attorney Jeremy Saland of Crotty Saland PC.

"Being a blowhard is not illegal, but whether what he's claiming **Nike** did is fact or fiction doesn't justify trying to enrich himself with a job that doesn't help remedy a wrong suffered by a client," Saland said.

On **Monday**, federal officials in **New York** arrested Avenatti, charging the pugnacious **Los Angeles** lawyer with threatening **Nike** with a stock-price-sinking press conference about recruitment misconduct if it didn't pay up.

Avenatti, who purported to be representing the coach of a youth basketball team once sponsored by **Nike**, demanded $1.5 million for the client, who had recently seen **Nike** drop its support, according to the charges. Separately, Avenatti and another attorney — an unnamed co-conspirator since identified as celebrity defense attorney Mark Geragos — also demanded **Nike** hire them to conduct an "internal investigation" related to amateur player recruiting.

The cost: at least $12 million and as much as $25 million. Prosecutors said Avenatti was also recorded at a March 21 meeting with **Nike** lawyers at Boies Schiller Flexner LLP offering to end the entire matter, with no bad publicity for **Nike**, for $22.5 million.

If the company didn't agree, Avenatti threatened an immediate press conference amid the NCAA basketball tournament about **Nike** making payments to youth players and their families, prosecutors said, an event he promised would snowball into more bad press and people coming forward with claims of recruiting malfeasance.

In a recorded phone call, Avenatti told **Nike** attorneys that if the company tried to negotiate a cap on the investigation fees, he would go public and "take a billion dollars off your client's market cap," according to the complaint. At a March 21 meeting in **New York**, Avenatti allegedly continued to wield threats and press for the investigator role, at one point asking **Nike** attorneys if they'd ever had "the balls of a client in [their] hands."

"Michael Avenatti may be the best lawyer in the world, according to Michael Avenatti, but there are appropriate courses of conduct to address an alleged wrongdoing, and I don't see how a demand of, 'Give me a job and pay me $12 million,' is ever going to make the client whole," Saland said.

Adam Felsenstein, a white collar defense specialist at Gallet Dreyer & Berkey LLP, called the prosecutor's narrative "very extortive," particularly on the allegation regarding Avenatti's demand to be hired directly by the company. If that element of the charges is well-founded, it would effectively leave Avenatti without a "cloak of legitimacy" that he was acting solely to resolve a dispute on behalf of his client.

The complaint "doesn't even refer to anticipated litigation. It's just, 'I'm going to reveal embarrassing information unless you pay me.' And once you start asking for money for yourself like that, you trend into extortion," Felsenstein said.

Barry Temkin of Mound Cotton Wollan & Greengrass LLP similarly characterized the alleged scheme as "brazen," and voiced doubt Avenatti would be able to argue that he could pressure **Nike** to hire him as an investigator and stay within the legal lines.

"He's going to them with a demand that they hire him even as he's threatening them with this press conference, which is screwed up on a lot of levels," he said. "It's ambulance chasing, which is unethical. It's a conflict of interest, and who would want to hire someone to do an internal investigation who is also shaking them down?"

Avenatti was arrested **Monday** just after he announced via **Twitter** an impending press conference about a "major high school/college basketball scandal" and criminal conduct "at the highest levels of **Nike**."

In an unrelated action, federal officials in **California** charged Avenatti on **Monday** with defrauding a client out of a $1.6 million settlement and lying to a **Mississippi** bank to secure loans for his firm and a coffee business.

Avenatti was released in **New York** later in **the day** after posting a $
