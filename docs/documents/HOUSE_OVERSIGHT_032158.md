should you point out to **Ariana Huff**, that the same type of person, same as **strauss Kahn** i s Andrews accuser, 
,long criminal record. total liar. Ariana should champion the dangers of false allegations. send a reporter or 
reporters to investigate,., the palace would love it, the girl in the photo , was nothing more than a telephone 
answerer„ she was never 15, according to her version she worked for trump , first at that age, at **Mara Lago**. ITs 
ridiculous. but the press like **strauss Kahn** is afraid to question women.
