﻿Cause and Effect
Fade the Trump risk premium – buy USD
13 February 2017
Concerns over stagflation return
In our view, the most interesting and important development in the global financial
market so far this year has been the divergence between rising US inflation breakevens
and falling US real yields. Rightly or wrongly, investors appear to have become
concerned about upside risk to inflation and downside risk to growth.
The Trump risk premium
Informal surveys of our clients suggest that stagflation concerns are being fed by
growing pessimism about the new Trump administration. Investors seem to think that
potential trade wars and a border adjustment tax (BAT) would boost inflation while
repealing Obamacare and the controversy regarding the BAT could delay the highly
anticipated tax reform.
Perception versus reality
In this report, we argue why the Trump risk premium may be too high. The
administration’s dealing with both China and Mexico in recent weeks suggests to us that
the near-term risk of open trade wars has abated. We are also less concerned that
Obamacare will take precedence over tax reform.

Most crucially, we think the overall tax reform is less dependent on the BAT than usually
thought. Our scenario analysis shows that what has been getting priced into the market
since January (higher inflation, lower USD) may be actually the least likely path for the
BAT. In more plausible scenarios, the USD does quite well and inflation breakevens
should be either unchanged or lower.
How to trade it?
We could get details on the tax reform as early as the new president’s speech to joint
session of Congress on February 28, 2017. We think this could validate our view of a
stronger USD.

Taking advantage of clean positioning and the decline in implied FX vol lately, we
recommend buying a 6w ATM EUR put/USD call (spot reference at 1.0615), costing
1.1% EUR. A 6-week option will cover also the March Fed meeting and the Dutch
election (both on March 15) that could also work in favour of the trade. A risk to the
trade is that is weak February data takes the possibility of a March Fed hike off the
table completely.
A list of open trades and those closed in the last 12 months can be found in our Global
Liquid Markets Weekly.

Concerns over stagflation return
On the surface, this has been an uneventful year for the US rates market so far. At the
start of January, the market was pricing two Fed hikes for the year. Six weeks later, the
market is still pricing only two Fed hikes for the year. The yield on the bellwether 10y
US Treasuries started the year at 2.44%. Six weeks later, it is at 2.41%, unchanged for
all practical purposes.
As usual, the surface view is deceiving. The seeming collapse in volatility belies the
dramatic changes in the composition and term structure of rates. Since the December
FOMC meeting, real yields and inflation breakevens have diverged in remarkable fashion.
Year to date, 5y real yields have declined by 16bp while 5y inflation breakevens have
risen by 12bp (Chart 1); the 5s-30s real curve is 10bp steeper while the breakeven curve
is 10bp flatter.

The effect of the divergence between real yields and inflation breakevens has been felt
across financial markets. For example, the USD, which trades with real rather than
nominal yields, has declined in tandem with real yields (Chart 2). In contrast, gold, which
usually thrives on inflation concerns, has been surging lately.
