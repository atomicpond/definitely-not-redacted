## Document Text

```
From: **Michael Wolff** 
Sent: **2/15/2017** 1:16:03 PM 
To: **Jeffrey Epstein** [jeevacation@gmail.com] 
Subject: A few favors... 
Importance: High 
So...I'm doing this Trump book for a pile of money and with so far quite a bit of cooperation from them (DT 
called me **the other day** and spent 45 minutes on the phone ranting and raving about the media--alarming). I 
wonder if you could introduce me to **Tom barrack**--just to say I'm a journalist who you know and trust, and that 
I'll follow up with a description of the project that I'm doing. Also, I'd love a reintroduction to Kathy Ruemmler. 
I need some off-the-record perspective on ****White House**** procedures. 
Are you in **NYC** soon?
