Introducing
Nautilus Education
The modern world has placed an unprecedented emphasis on
science literacy. But most existing science texts do not emphasize
literacy, and most literary texts don’t have science.
This Nautilus Education text set pamphlet is a beta product
intended to fill this gap. It contains three groups of articles from the
award-winning science magazine, Nautilus, each accompanied by lesson
plans and guides for teachers.
Key science concepts like genetics and astronomy are explored
through narrative story telling and tailor-made artwork, letting science
spill over its usual borders, and waking the imagination and interest of
the student. This kind of literary science classroom material was
designed to helps teachers satisfy the new U.S. common core and
next gen standards but have global application. The relevant standards
are listed in each lesson plan.
Nautilus is looking for partners interested in using and further
developing this kind of content. For more information, please write
to education@nautil.us.

About **Nautilus Magazine**
Nautilus is a new kind of science magazine. Each monthly issue tackles
a single topic in contemporary science using multiple vantage points,
from biology and physics to culture and philosophy. We are science,
connected.

Astronomy & Space Travel
How would we travel nearly five light years? This article explores different engineering solutions
to the puzzle of taking a very, very, long trip, intertwining science-fiction goals with real world
solutions. Students will explore fanciful applications of Newton’s second law, and concepts of
momentum, ions, and nuclear fusion.
Lesson Plan
Review vocabulary words in class. Have students read the article and answer the reading comprehension questions
for homework, as well as generate a discussion question of their own. In class, address any conceptual
questions that the class might have. Have students write discussion questions on the board, along with the ones
suggested in this document. Have students break up into small groups, each of which should address one of the
discussion questions. 15 MIN
Dedicate the remaining class time to completing one of the activities. 30-45 MIN
Teacher’s Notes: Roadmap to Alpha Centauri
VOCAB WORDS
Magnetic field: produced by a magnetic material or a
current, a magnetic field will push or pull a moving
charge or magnet that comes in contact with it.
Ion: an atom in which the number of electrons and
protons is unequal—thus, the atom is positive or
negative.
Momentum: the product of the mass and velocity of
an object.
Recoil: the backward momentum from a fired gun.
Plasma: one of the four fundamental states of matter,
composed of ions and electrons.
Nuclear fusion: when two or more clusters of neutrons
and protons collide, forming a new nucleus and
releasing energy.
READING COMPREHENSION
1. What does AU stand for?
2. How fast is Voyager 1 moving in miles per hour?
3. “The engine first strips propellant atoms [typically
xenon] of their outermost electrons.” What
is the charge of a stripped xenon atom?
4
NAUTIL. US | TEXT SETS
4. What concept is at work in the ion drive? (Hint:
what is conserved?)
5. What other travel options work on this principle?
6. How much momentum does an electron fired
from a gun have?
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
1. Why not take a traditional rocket to Alpha
Centauri?
2. Which of the propulsion meturds listed is most
likely to succeed? Would any be used together?
3. Would it be worth going if it took generations?
4. How far away is the next-nearest star?
ACTIVITIES
1. Research and create a brochure or ad enticing
astronauts to make the trip. What would they eat?
What psychological qualities would they need? If
robots were sent, how would they be fixed? What
kind of data could they expect to collect?
WHERE THIS FITS IN THE CURRICULUM
Structure and Properties of Matter (HS-PS1-8) Develop
models to illustrate the changes in the composition
of the nucleus of the atom and the energy released
during the processes of fission, fusion, and radioactive
decay.
Forces and Interactions (HS-PS2-1) Analyze data to support
the claim that Newton’s second l
