Filing # 37201585 E-Filed 01/29/2016 03:47:44 PM 
IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE 
SEVENTEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT 
IN AND FOR ****Broward County****, FLORIDA 
CASE NO.: CACE 15-000072 
**Bradley J. Edwards** and 
**Paul G. Cassell**, 
Plaintiffs/**Counterclaim Defendants**, 
vs. 
ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ, 
Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff 
/ 
DEFENDANT/COUNTERCLAIM PLAINTIFF ALAN DERSHOWITZ'S  
MOTION FOR CLARIFICATION OF CONFIDENTIALITY ORDER OR RELIEF 
FROM THAT ORDER 
The transcript of the deposition of non-party Virginia Roberts Giuffre ("Roberts") is 
currently under seal as a result of the January 12, 2016 Confidentiality Order in this action. 
Dershowitz seeks clarification that the Confidentiality Order does not preclude him or his 
counsel from submitting the transcript of the deposition to the Office of the State Attorney, the 
Office of **the **United States**** Attorney, and other appropriate investigative authorities solely for 
purposes of requesting that those offices consider opening perjury investigations regarding 
Roberts's testimony. To the extent that the Confidentiality Order precludes such disclosure, 
Dershowitz requests that the Court modify it to permit the requested disclosure in the public 
interest. 
Roberts has stated in an affidavit originally filed publicly in federal court in what the 
parties have referred to as the CVRA Action that she was present on Jeffrey Epstein's private 
island, Little St. James Island, at the same time as former President Clinton. That affidavit was 
1 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 010887 
stricken in relevant part from the record by the federal court, but Roberts's counsel filed publicly 
a pleading in this case contesting Defendant's assertion that her statements in the media 
regarding meeting former President Clinton were untrue. A copy of the public affidavit filed in 
the CVRA Action and the excerpted portion of the pleading filed in this action are attached 
hereto as composite Exhibit A. 
Because former President Clinton did not leave office until January of 2001, and Roberts 
has repeatedly stated in publicly filed affidavits that she "escaped" from Epstein while in 
Thailand in September of 2002, the alleged meeting with former President Clinton must have 
taken place between January of 2001 and September of 2002. As explained in the letter attached 
as Exhibit B, former FBI Director Louis Freeh made a request pursuant to the Freedom of 
Information Act for documents from **the **Secret Service**** regarding **Secret Service** personnel 
travelling with former President Clinton to Epstein's private island and **the US Virgin Islands**. 
Based on the response by the federal government to this request, and his knowledge of the duties, 
protocols and operations of security provided to a former President, Mr. Freeh opines in the 
attached letter that the absence of such records "strongly establishes that former President 
Clinton was not present on Little St. James Island during the period at issue." If Mr. Freeh's 
opinion is correct, then Roberts's publicly filed affidavits in which she stated that she met 
President Clinton on the island during that period are obviously false. Dershowitz intends to 
bring this public information to the attention of the appropriate authorities. 
Separate from the public information, Dershowitz also believes that Roberts gave false 
testimony at her deposition. The relevant testimony, which Dershowitz intends to provide to the 
appropriate authorities, is being filed under seal contemporaneously with this motion. In an 
abundance of caution, Dershowitz and his counsel do not want to disclose this non-public 
2 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 010888 
information even to the responsible public officials with a right and need to know without 
obtaining confirmation from this Court that doing so would not violate the Confidentiality Order 
or alternatively relief from that Confidentiality Order. 
Respectfully submitted,
