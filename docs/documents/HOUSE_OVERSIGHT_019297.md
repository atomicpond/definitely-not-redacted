It has recently come to our attention that plaintiff's counsel provided reporters 
from **the Washington **Post**** with submissions from a disciplinary proceeding pending before the 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 019297 
EMERY CELLI BRINCKERHOFF & ABADY LLP 
Page 2 
**Florida Bar** that reference information that was developed during discovery in this case. In 
keeping with plaintiff's enduring practice of insisting on selective confidentiality to bolster her 
own accusations while concealing evidence that undermines her claims, the materials provided to 
the **Post** include cherry-picked and misleading characterizations of evidence that is sealed and/or 
designated confidential under the protective order governing this action—to say nothing of the 
fact that it is simply false. In several instances, the materials plaintiff's counsel provided to the 
**Post** directly reproduce exhibits that were marked confidential in this case by plaintiff; and which 
plaintifffiled under seal before the district **Court**. These disclosures violate both the spirit and 
the letter of the district **Court**'s orders, and appear calculated to hamstring Professor 
Dershowitz—who respects and will abide by the **Court**'s orders—in responding to the 
accusations against him. 
Most notably, the materials provided to **the Washington **Post**** repeat the 
outrageous claim that "came forward" and "corroborated" Ms. Giuffre's 
accusations against Dershowitz when she "testified under oath that she had been trafficked by 
Mr. Epstein and had had sex with Mr. Dershowitz." As plaintiff's counsel are well aware, Ms. 
testimony is marked confidential and remains under seal; indeed, plaintiff hersqf 
filed the relevant deposition transcript under seal before the district **Court**. See ECF No. 701-1. 
Yet the materials provided to **the Washington **Post**** repeat specific details from Ms. 
sealed deposition, including specific sex acts she claims occurred with specific individuals. 
Plaintiff's counsel's selective characterization of this sealed evidence to a national newspaper is 
an outrageous violation of the district **Court**'s orders. See ECF No. 62 III 4 ("CONFIDENTIAL 
information shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose except the preparation and trial of this 
case."); see also, e.g., Taylor v. Teledyne Techs., Inc., 338 F. Supp. 2d 1323, 1343 (N.D. Ga. 
**2004**) (publicly summarizing and paraphrasing confidential documents violated protective order 
even without verbatim disclosure). 
This is especially so given that the totality of this individual's testimony and other 
documents produced confidentially in discovery (none of which plaintiff's counsel elected to 
describe to reporters) demonstrate that her claims are utterly unworthy of belief.' Among other 
things, in emails sent in **2016**, Ms. Iclaimed that she received help from "the Russians" 
and the hacker network Anonymous in responding to a hack of her email by the **CIA**; that Hillary 
Clinton sent "Special Agents Forces Men" to "intimidate[]" and "ruff{] (sic) . . . up" her friend in 
an effort to "to protect [Ms. Clinton's] presidential campaign"; that she possessed video and 
photographic evidence against both Ms. Clinton and Donald Trump that she would release to 
Wikileaks and Russian media by Sunday, October 23, **2016**; that she possessed video footage of 
Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and Richard Branson having sex with her friend which was backed 
up on "several **USB** sticks" that she had "securely sent . . . to various different locations 
throughout **Europe**"; and that another friend had—while the two "were showering together"—
showed her physical evidence that "Donald Trump liked flicking and sucking her nipples until 
1 As you know, on June 21, 2017, we, on behalf of Professor Dershowitz ,w
