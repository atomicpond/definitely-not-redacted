Ben and Lord Mandelson: 
My late reply does no justice to my enthusiasm to follow up on our previous call and to your interest in the same. Apologies. 
A word of explanation about **the past two weeks**: 
• Financing: 
Am in the midst of a $8-10 mn financing 
In past two weeks have met potential investors in **Toronto**, **Vancouver**, DC, **NYC**, and **Boston**. 
Have in this time already closed approximately $2 mn, which is encouraging 
This pace will continue for another month or so until the financing is fully closed. 
• US DoD: 
**last week** several of us took our prototype device to be demonstrated for the US military's Walter Reed Army Institute of 
Research (WRAIR). 
At the conclusion of a four-hour session our host, Colonel Colin Ohrt, MD, who is in charge of the relevant WRAIR program, 
called our device a game-changer. He would like to pilot our device in **Tanzania**, **Cambodia**, **Kenya**, and **Thailand**. Follow up is 
being arranged. 
Colonel Ohrt also separately evaluated our white paper on malaria elimination and expressed strong interest in also pursuing this 
project with Fio. 
Accompanying Fio for these meetings was General Richard Tubb, MD (retired **last year** from the US **Air Force**). Dick was Chief 
of the White **HOUSE** Medical Unit and physician to Presidents **CLINTON** and **Bush**. 
• **USAID** 
Also **last week** we successfully demonstrated our device for **USAID** and the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI). Follow up is 
being arranged. 
Accompanying Fio for these meetings was Andrew Natsios, former head of **USAID**. 
For all the foregoing meetings our prototype device performed well. Exciting times. 
My trip to **London** has yet to be arranged and is dependent on financing events. In the meantime, I will happily travel to meet you 
in **NYC**. 
Attached is the White Paper on Malaria Elimination which Fio had written and invited several academic partners to join. Since the 
time the document was first drafted, we discovered an even simpler technical strategy based on our new prototype device and 
reinforced by our recent discussion with WRAIR. This simplification would result in field trials as early as next year, which is 
much sooner than in the attached White Paper. To accomplish this we would team up with WRAIR rather than some of the current 
academic partners in the paper. 
Best regards and wishes, 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 029914

PS: Ben, any emails I've sent to Lord Mandelson always bounced back. Clearly I don't have the correct email address. Kindly 
forward this note to Lord Mandelson and forward his correct email address to me. Thanks.

**Michael**, 
Thanks for your time on **Friday**, it was great to hear more about FIO, we are keen to hear more. 
In terms of follow up 
- we look forward to receiving the White Paper that you mentioned. 
- we will consider opportunities in **Russia**, principally via Rusnano, who we are in discussions 
with http://www.rusnano.com/Home.aspx?dummy=634236281106041875  
- you asked about Onexim, this is the principal investment vehicle for Prokhorov (think **New Jersey** 
Nets). He's reckoned to be the wealthiest man in **Russia** post-crisis. He is investing more in nanotech and 
green energy projects. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 029915 
- **London** meeting - please let us know dates when you might be coming through **Europe**. 
- NY meeting - we will update when we know more about plans to come to **New York** as we could also aim 
to meet there. 
Let's keep in touch and see where we get. 
Best 
Ben
