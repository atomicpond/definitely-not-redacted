Subject: My review **today** in **WSJ** of conspiracy theories 
Importance: High 
They're Not Really Out to Get You 
By EDWARD JAY **Epstein** 
Dec. 18, 2015, **Wall Street Journal**

Conspiracy, a word derived from the Latin "to breathe together," has been a salient part of the darker 
side of recorded history ever since some 60 conspirators in the Roman senate, including Brutus and 
Cassius, plotted together to assassinate Julius Caesar in 44 B.C. Nowadays the "C" word does not always 
sit well with journalists, who commonly employ it in conjunction with "theory" to describe paranoid 
distortions of reality. 
Even so, a criminal conspiracy is not a rare phenomenon. Not only was a foreign conspiracy responsible 
for the monstrous 9/11 attack on **the World Trade Center** (as well as the previous attempt to blow it up in 
**1993**) but, according to the Center on Law and Security at Fordham University, over 90% of routine federal 
indictments for terrorist attacks since 9/11 contain at least one conspiracy charge. The government's 
pursuit of conspiracies is by no means limited to terrorism. Conspiracy charges are the rule rather than 
the exception in cases brought against businessmen accused of fixing prices, evading environmental 
regulations, using insider information or laundering money. 
But there are also pseudo-conspiracies that exist only in a delusionary or misinformed mind. And some of 
them achieve a huge following. In **Pakistan**, according to public opinion polls, a majority of the 
population believes that the 9/11 attack was staged by President **George W. Bush** to launch a war on **Islam**. 
The claim that the **1969** moon landing was faked is still around. Just two days ago a crew from a Russian 
TV channel rushed to my apartment to interview me about a viral post on **YouTube** in which the deceased 
director Stanley Kubrick supposedly made a deathbed confession to having filmed the landing in a 
**Hollywood** studio—even though everything about the post, including a fake Kubrick, was untrue. 
Why people believe in pseudo-conspiracies is the focus of Rob **Brotherton**'s fascinating book "Suspicious 
Minds." Mr. **Brotherton**, an academic psychologist, advances the thesis that the belief in pseudo-
conspiracies proceeds from the "quirks and foibles" in the way that the human brain, or at least some 
human brains, process evidence. He lucidly reviews studies showing common defects in the brain's wiring, 
such as the bias that selects evidence to confirm rather than undermine a pre-adopted thesis. "We seek 
what we expect to find," as Mr. **Brotherton** puts it. Relatedly, "biased assimilation" causes us to 
"interpret ambiguous events in light of what we already believe." 
Discussing Richard Hofstadter's **1964** essay "The Paranoid Style in American Politics," Mr. **Brotherton** 
accepts Hofstadter's characterization of proponents of politically motivated conspiracy theories as 
"paranoid" and suffering from "a psychic phenomenon" that prevents them from seeing the absurdity of 
their position. But he disagrees with Hofstadter that this condition affects only a small number of 
people on the fringes of society. For Mr. **Brotherton**, "conspiracy theories thrive in the mainstream." 
Until the controversy over the validity of Warren Commission's **1966** report on the **Kennedy** assassination, 
the phrase "conspiracy theory" had a more neutral meaning, suggesting a plausible yet unproven claim 
about multiple actors in a single event. Only in the aftermath of **the Warren Commission** did it become a 
derogatory term used to suggest theories that subvert conventional wisdom. To those who doubted the 
commission's finding that a single gunman killed **Kennedy**, Earl Warren became, Mr. **Brotherton**'s says, the 
"figurehead in a vast cover-up." 
It is not easy to find an objective criterion that distinguishes the inquiry into a real conspiracy from 
one that chases a pseudo-conspiracy. Both types rely are the eyewitnesses, documents and forensic 
evidence. The best that Mr. **Brotherton** can offer on this score is to cite Stewart Potter's famous comment 
on pornography: "I know it when I see it." In the context of suspicious minds, though, one person might 
see a plausible case for a conspiracy and another only outlandish connections. The distinction is in the 
mind of the beholder. 
Mr. **Brotherton** offers a sample list of conspiracy theories, including ones alleging that **Abraham **Lincoln**** 
was assassinated on the orders of his vice president; that the moon landing was faked; that Area 51 in 
**New Mexico** is home to extra-terrestrial technology under government auspices; that President Obama is "a 
communist Muslim from **Kenya**." Such theories are meant to show that suspicious minds leap to absurd 
conclusions. These are chosen because there is no evidence to support them. 
The picture changes, however, if we consider, for example, the theory claiming that **Lincoln**'s assassin, 
John Wilkes Booth was pa
