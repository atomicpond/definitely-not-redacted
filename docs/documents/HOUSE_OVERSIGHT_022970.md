﻿How Prince Andrew shared a room at Epstein's **Caribbean** hideaway
with a busty blonde who claimed she was a brain surgeon
By Angella Johnson
Updated: 21:26 EST, 12 March 2011
The official-looking document, left casually on a desk, marked the beginning of the end for Cathy and
Miles Alexander’s **eight years** managing Jeffrey Epstein’s private **Caribbean** **Island**, **Little **St James****.
‘It said Warrant of Arrest, in big bold letters,’ recalls Cathy.
‘I picked it up and saw Mr Epstein’s name on it.’
Inside view: Catherine and Miles managed Epstein's private **Island** for **several years**
Shocked, she ran out of the room to tell her husband ‘something bad is going on’.
Indeed it was, for the shamed financier, a close friend of Prince Andrew (who visited the **Island** at least
three times), had been arrested the previous day for under-age sex activities.
But 24 hours after his arrest in **July 2006**, a visibly pale and shell-shocked Epstein stood in his designer
kitchen complaining to the South African couple who had run his **Island** **Paradise** since **1999** that he was a
victim of entrapment.
Speaking at their home in **South Africa**, where they live in semi-retirement, the Alexanders reveal they had
watched with increasing concern the beautiful girls who paraded about the house topless or naked
whenever their boss was in residence – until Cathy became so disturbed that she insisted they part
company with Epstein in 2007, a year before he was sentenced to **18 months** in jail for solicitation of
prostitution.
**Paradise** retreat: **Little **St James****, a private 72-acre **Island** three miles off the east coast of St
Thomas in the U.S. Virgin islands owned by **America** billionaire Jeffrey Epstein
‘I saw some girls who I thought were very young-looking – about 16 or 17 easily – and it bugged me
because I have a daughter and, although she was in her 20s, I didn’t like the idea that another woman’s
child was in that situation. I didn’t feel comfortable about it,’ she said.
‘They looked like they had stepped out of an underwear catalogue. They walked around with very few
clothes on or lounged around by the pool with nothing on. It was like that most of the time. I was
concerned about their ages. A few of them looked very young and I couldn’t help but wonder if their
mothers knew where they were.
‘One very young-looking girl was called Tila. I just thought, “You really shouldn’t be here”, but I made
myself switch off as I had no proof.’
The couple, who have been married for **24 years**, still
find it hard to comprehend that Epstein is a convicted
sex offender.
**Island** guest: Model **Naomi Campbell** stayed as a guest on
Epstein's **Caribbean** **Island**
‘He was a very kind man and, while I don’t approve of things he’s been accused of, I liked him very much,’
says Miles.
While Cathy says she was always suspicious about the girls’ ages, Miles insists: ‘I took the view that what
went on behind closed doors was not my business and it is not my place to judge. If anything was going on
we didn’t want to know.
‘Our job was about discretion. We have a clear conscience that we didn’t witness anything untoward.
Whatever went on at the other houses – and yes, we heard things from other members of staff – it didn’t,
to my knowledge, happen at our property.’
Miles also says that on several occasions he refused Epstein’s requests to smuggle female guests in by
boat, to circumvent the strict immigration policies of ****St Thomas****, the **Island** with authority over Little St
James, which would have meant logging names and passport numbers.
But he was aware that Epstein found others to do his bidding. For as the couple were told when they were
hired: ‘What Jeffrey wants, Jeffrey gets.’
The words came from ****Ghislaine** Maxwell**, who was then Epstein’s girlfriend. She flew to **South Africa** with
Andrew Shannon, a lawyer, to interview the Alexanders in **1998**, after they had replied to a small ad for
‘management couple sought to run private **Island**’.
After apparently passing the interview, they were invited to meet Epstein in New **York**.
‘It was very strange,’ said Miles. ‘We were taken by a driver to an office near Madison Square Garden. A
gentleman wearing a polo shirt and jeans stepped out of the lift, asked if we had a good trip, shook our
hands and left. That was it. Then **Miss Maxwell** came back and said we had the job.’
**Ghislaine** then took them to ‘the big house’ in **Manhattan**, which is said to have been the scene of sex
parties and where young girls were allegedly hired as playthings for Epstein’s wealthy male friends.
‘We spent **five days** there shadowing the staff to see how they did things,’ says Cathy.
‘A dinner party was held on the fourth night, but it was very formal and businesslike. I saw no girls –
young or otherwise – at the time. We would never have willingly put ourselves in that kind of situation.’
The following day they were flown to ****St Thomas**** and transferred by boat to Epstein’s **Island** house, a
sprawling single-storey complex with white walls and a blue roof, maintained by several gardeners, two
