Eye on the Market, July 25, 2011 (the attached PDF document is much easier to read)

Topics: US debt ceiling negotiations, a more ambitious European bailout plan (finally), and how large cap growth stocks and rising corporate profits are patiently waiting for both of them to end

 

White Castle.   Twenty five years ago, I had a friend with a peculiar way of responding to seeing things he didn’t like on TV: he would throw White Castle hamburgers at the screen.  I always thought this was a bad way to waste a good hamburger, but I had one of those moments the other night when watching news reports on debt ceiling discussions.  Media outlets have referred to President **Reagan**’s scolding of Congressional Republicans for delaying debt ceiling increases, and the 18 increases that took place during his Presidency.  The implication: reservations about raising the debt ceiling are as irresponsible now as they were then.  This is a disingenuous argument; in the 1980’s, the debt ceiling being debated was 50% of GDP, and had no bearing on the solvency of **the United States**.  **today**, the proposed increase raises the debt limit twice as high, measured relative to GDP or government revenues.  While a default is a very bad idea (deserving of a White Castle hurling of its own), unconstrained debt growth with no plan to slow it is bad as well.  Some suggest we not worry about debt growth, since demand from foreign central banks and **the Federal Reserve** would keep yields in check.  That logic is irresponsible at best.  Debt limit legislation is a rocky but healthy way for a democracy to decide whether mega-deficits are in the long-term public interest.  

 



 

Over **the last few days**, the Gang of Six plan, the Reid-McConnell plan and the Obama-Boehner plan have all been raised up the flagpole and then lowered.  By the end of the process, we’re still looking for deficit reduction of $3 trillion+ over **10 years** (relative to the CBO Alternative case in which there is no deficit reduction at all).  However, **Congress** is running short on time, and may have to do a smaller debt ceiling increase/deficit reduction first.   For now, we wait to see the balance of spending cuts and revenue increases will be agreed to.  ****last week**’s** Profiles in Courage piece walked through the history and dynamics of this process, so we won’t repeat that here.  Here’s our take on what has been proposed so far, with the caveat that many plans are not crystal clear what baseline they are using, or what steps they recommend to get to that baseline first.  For example: the Gang of Six state that they used the President’s budget as a baseline (scored by CBO in **March 2011**), reduced deficits by $3.7 trillion, and ended up with a 71% debt/GDP ratio; but they do not explain how they get to the President’s baseline in the first place.



I have a feeling that revenue increases will be a material (e.g., 25% or more) part of the deal.  The Peterson Foundation’s sampling of 6 policy groups shown below indicate that 5 of 6 recommend revenue increases compared to where we are **today**; the **Heritage Foundation**’s “Woody Guthrie Memorial Budget Plan” is the only exception.  What kind of revenue increases?  Raising the top two brackets, which would affect joint filers with adjusted gross incomes above $212,300, would raise $450-$700 billion over **10 years** (depending on whether you use OMB or CBO numbers).  If they cannot agree to raise rates, another option (as in the Gang of Six plan) would be reductions in the deductibility of state and local taxes, sales taxes, mortgage interest, etc.  As this gets sorted out, let’s hope everyone recognizes that the US tax system is already progressive.  As shown in the chart below, effective Federal tax rates for low earners have dropped to zero over **the last decade**, even after including FICA taxes.  News reports that the US tax system is regressive make me want to throw hamburgers at the screen.

 



 

**Europe**: Finally (!!), but now what?

For the first time since 2009, it felt **last week** like European policymakers were trying to get out in front of things.  In exchange for a modest amount of “private sector involvement”, **Germany** agreed to more generous financing terms for **Greece**, **Ireland** and **Portugal**, and an expanded role for the EU-IMF lending facility (see following page).  What would the plan accomplish if implemented?  While Greek debt to GDP ratios would remain well over 125% of GDP (the IMF estimate for **next year** is a ridiculous 170%), **Greece**’s near-term financing obligations would decline, due to debt buybacks, exchanges into long maturity bonds, and interest grace periods on new EU loans.  More broadly, the plan also allows for money to be lent to countries before they enter into an IMF program, for recapitalization of banks.  All things considered, it’s the bro
