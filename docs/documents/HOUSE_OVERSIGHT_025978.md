US
Quantifying the (bond-equity correlation) risks to risk parity
Last week’s sharp sell-off in JGBs renewed concerns of forced selling by risk parity
funds. While the drawdowns in US Treasuries, US equities, and ultimately risk parity
portfolios were small and short-lived, the latent risk remains worth monitoring, as (i)
leverage is still near max levels across a variety of risk parity parametrizations, (ii) bond
allocations are historically elevated, and (iii) markets continue to be sceptical of a 2016
Fed hike. Hence we provide a simple scenario tool to help investors assess what relative
moves in bonds and equities could catalyse significant deleveraging by rules-based risk
parity funds running vol target overlays. For example, a -2% daily decline in the S&P
500 coupled with a -0.6% fall in 10y Treasury prices (poor diversification) could trigger a
25% deleveraging (of unlevered notional) today, whereas a -4% SPX drop and +1% bond
rally (good diversification) would generate no selling pressure, underscoring the critical
role played by bond-equity correlation in governing the severity of risk parity unwinds.
Europe
Buy the seasonal oil dip via bullish X-market risk reversals
Selling rich USO (WTI tracker) 3M 25d puts to fund cheaper SXEP (European Oil & Gas
equity) calls is historically attractive. Indeed the number (>2) of long SXEP calls per short
USO put is in the 90 th %-ile since 2008. The trade leverages both our commodity
strategists’ ‘buy the dip’ view and our equity strategists’ bullish outlook on the Oil & Gas
sector, which has been the worst performing over the last 1M. Moreover, the average
payoff of being long SXEP 3M 25d calls would have been >2x greater than USO 3M 25d
calls (owing to more frequent positive returns), when sized for the same upfront cost.
Asia
Own NKY Sep/Oct calendar call at vol hit YTD low level going into the Sep BOJ
Post the Jul-16 BoJ and the announcement of a ¥28.1tn fiscal stimulus package, NKY and
USDJPY 1M vols have dropped to near YTD low levels, both USDJPY and NKY 2M-1M
term structures are historically steep, pricing in a slow summer. Our strategists believe
Sep-16 BoJ’s will likely create uncertainty, however, NKY Sep-Oct ATM fwd vol currently
trades at the low end of its trading range going into BoJ’s YTD. Plus, our analysis
suggests a further squeeze in yield will likely be positive for the NKY. We recommend
buying 1x NKY Oct 17500 call vs. selling 0.65x Sep 17250 call.
Trade update: Closing the NKY Aug/Sep put calendar trade at 0.28% premium
Korean auto-callable issuance slightly rose while NKY Uridashi issuance fell in July
