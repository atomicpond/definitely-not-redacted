Re: **Subpoena** to Lieutenant General Michael T. **flynn** (**Ret**.) 
Dear Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman Warner: 
We write in response to the **Senate** Select **Committee** on **Intelligence**'s **Subpoena** dated 
May 10, **2017**, requesting that our client, Lieutenant General Michael T. **flynn** (**Ret**.), produce 
any documents he may have that are responsive to a broad range of requests covering an **18-
month** period of time. Specifically, the **Subpoena** requests that he create a list of all meetings and 
all communications between himself and Russian officials, and that he produce records of all 
communications between himself and President **Trump**'s campaign that were in any way related 
to **Russia**, for the period from June 16, 2015, to **January 20, **2017****. 
In our May 8, **2017**, letter to **The **Committee****, we reiterated General **flynn**'s eagerness to 
give a full account of the facts and to answer **The **Committee****'s questions, should the 
circumstances permit, including assurances against unfair prosecution. We stated that, absent 
such assurances, General **flynn** would respectfully decline your request for an interview and for 
the production of documents. 
Our client's position remains unchanged. Producing documents that fall within the 
**Subpoena**'s broad scope would be a testimonial act, insofar as it would confirm or deny the 
existence of such documents. Under the Fifth Amendment to **the **United States**** Constitution and 
applicable **Court** precedents, no person is required to offer testimony when he has "reasonable 
cause to apprehend danger from a direct answer," even when that person is entirely innocent 
and has committed no crime.1 Indeed, **the **United States**** **Supreme **Court**** has "emphasized that 
one of the Fifth Amendment's basic functions... is to protect innocent men . . . who otherwise 
might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances."2 The **Court** held that even "truthful responses 
of an innocent witness" may provide the **Government** with evidence that could be used against

the witness. 3 And, as courts have repeatedly held, the protection offered by the Fifth 
Amendment privilege extends to producing documents where the act of production itself is 
testimonial in nature. 
The context in which **The **Committee**** has called for General **flynn**'s testimonial 
production of documents makes clear that he has more than a reasonable apprehension that any 
testimony he provides could be used against him. Multiple Members of **Congress** have 
demanded that he be investigated and even prosecuted. He is the target on nearly a **daily** basis of 
outrageous allegations, often attributed to anonymous sources in **Congress** or elsewhere in the 
**United States** **Government**, which, however fanciful on their face and unsubstantiated by 
evidence, feed the escalating public frenzy against him.4 Additionally, in the intervening time 
since **The **Committee**** issued its **Subpoena**, **the Department of Justice** has appointed a special 
counsel to investigate these and related matters. This environment creates a "reasonable cause 
to apprehend danger," giving rise to a constitutional right not to testify. A detailed explanation 
of the legal basis for respectfully declining to comply with **The **Committee****'s requests follows 
below.5 
The Fifth Amendment Privilege Bars **Congress** From Compelling A Witness to Provide 
Testimony Through The Act of Producing Documents  
The Fifth Amendment protects an individual from being "compelled in any criminal case 
to be a witness against himself." U.S. Const. amend. V. This privilege applies in congressional 
investigations. In Watkins v. **United States**, Chief Justice Warren stressed that "the 
constitutional rights of witnesses will be respected by the **Congress** as they are in a **Court** of 
justice.... Witnesses cannot be compelled to give evidence against themselves." 354 U.S. 178, 
187-88 (**1957**). **the **Supreme **Court****** later held in **United States** v. **Hubbell**, 530 U.S. 27,34 
(200o), that the right not to be compelled to give testimony against oneself applies as well to the 
compelled production of documents that would be "testimonial" in nature. Specifically, the act 
of producing documents in response to a **Subpoena** may have a "compelled testimonial aspect" 
when "the act of production itself may implicitly communicate statements of fact" that the 
documents "existed, were in his possession or control, and w
