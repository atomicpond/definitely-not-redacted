         REMEMBERING CAVALIER MAGAZINE

LAUNCHING A MAGAZINE


     My friend Michael Simmons, who has been the editor of **National Lampoon**, recalls that Cavalier hired fine scribes. A few examples: Thomas Pynchon, Philip Roth, William Saroyan, **Isaac Asimov**, Theodore Sturgeon. Characters show up from Andy Warhol to Timothy Leary. And the photos of models weren’t even soft porn, merely tits and ass.


     Cavalier was launched by Fawcett Publications in **1952**. Men’s magazine Cavalier (motto: “For the American Male”) was published **the year before** Playboy, to whom it has often been compared. Back in **the day**, Cavalier tried to be seen as slightly hipper, more youthful, and considered a bit more clever than its big name rival. Almost an anti-establishment in Playboy. A slogan stated: “Your dad bought Playboy; you bought Cavalier.”


I BECAME A COLUMNIST


     I was invited to write a column, named “The Naked Emperor,” for Cavalier, that was beginning to publish underground writers and artists. They paid me $1,000 a month. My first column, in **1964**, was a report on an auction of two-inch squares from the hotel bedsheets slept on by the Beatles during their first trip to America.


     There were 300 screaming young girls, off on a fetishist’s holiday. Obviously, there wouldn’t be enough items to go around, but it was announced that the Beatles’ unwashed towels and bed linens were to be cut into two-inch squares and sold for $1 each. The price included a notarized statement of authenticity.


     My second column was about **Lenny Bruce**—titled “Lenny the Lawyer,” since he defended himself in trials He was arrested for obscene performances only because there were no blasphemy laws, and he ridiculed religious leaders. I went to the bank and deposited my check, withdrawing half of it in cash, a $500 bill. Lenny was alone in his funky hotel room on ****Christmas Day**** when I presented it to him. And, with a large safety pin, Lenny attached the $500 bill to the outside breast pocket of his dungaree jacket.


AFTER JFK ASSASSINATION


       In another column of mine, “Jack Ruby and His Dirty Little Secret,” it began, “**Lenny Bruce** once told me how all the night club comics used to gossip about Jack Ruby’s “tattoo of a lady’s schmutzik (translate: pussy) in his armpit.” If it weren’t a fact, I was quite willing to settle for an apocryphal allusion which nevertheless crystallized the entire personality of that alleged murderer who wanted so very much to be liked.


      I say alleged because upon Ruby’s own death. **Dallas** District Attorney Henry Wade said he would dismiss the murder charge against him, a promise which has since been kept, although no such posthumous grace was ever officially bestowed on **Lee Harvey Oswald**, considered a lone assassin who shot President Kennedy. See, they grant you retroactive innocence only in the face of innumerable witnesses who were present at the actual event through the legal miracle of inadvertent televised coverage.


     Now Jack Ruby’s dirty little secret has been forever sealed away in his armpit by the hymen of history. Oh yeah, and at Lenny’s funeral, that safety pin was still attached on his denim jacket.


JULES SIEGEL                      


       **two years** before Lenny’s death, with his permission I published his obituary in my own magazine, The Realist. Before the issue went to press, he called his mother and a few others to let them know it would only be a hoax. The point was that he couldn't get work and his work was his life so he might as well be dead. And if people regretted that they hadn't helped him, well, now they could have a second chance because he was still alive. The obituary evoked inquiries from newspapers, wire services, foreign publications, radio and TV.


       “What's the meaning of it?” one editor asked me. “There's a lot of excitement at the city desk.”


       “That is the meaning of it.”


     **A few years later**, without my permission, Jules Siegel, the editor of a short-lived magazine, **Cheetah**, published a fake obituary of me. I thought it was funny. An **Associated Press** reporter called, and I explained that it was a hoax.


     “Are you sure?” he asked.


     “Of course. I would tell you if I was dead.”


     Siegel started writing for Cavalier. His first assignment was a profile of Sterling Hayden, an actor best known in Dr, Stranglove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.


     Journalist Adam Ellsworth described Siegel’s “Goodbye Surfing, Hello God” with his most famous example of rock journalism, though his most revolutionary was his article, “The Big Beat.” It appeared in the Playboy-esque Cavalier magazine in **1965** and was one of the earliest writings he’d ever seen on the development of rock and roll, from slaves singing in chains on their way to America to **Bob Dylan** “going electric” at the Newport Folk Festival. 


     Then Jules’ friend, Arthur Kretchmer, became Cavalier’s managing editor. “When the editorial director lat
