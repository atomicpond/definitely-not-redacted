Importance: High 
Moving (small places in Raleigh and **Bellevue**), wrapping up taxes, wrapping up fire claim, trying to figure out 
if technologies that soothe the nervous system (that offer the positive effects that meditation or massage might 
offer) are worth working on....

trump appealing and his flaws invisible... 
Will you have a cabinet position? 
How are you?
