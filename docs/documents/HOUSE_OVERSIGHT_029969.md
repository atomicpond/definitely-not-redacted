Subject: Hello!!! 
Importance: **High 
Hi **Jeffrey****, 
Just called, but not sure I have the right cell number for you. Thinking of you and hope life is treating you great! Any 
news? 
All good here in the District of Corruption — I'm lovin' Trump. He is turning this town on its head, and have to admit, I'm 
enjoying watching the action (except for the shooting, of course, which was tragic). Especially interesting is watching 
the Dems implode — I'm really shocked at how wrong they judged the public. Am having dinner **tonight** with one of the 
Blue Dog Dems, and think they could maneuver to take over the party — Rep. Jim Costa is the defacto head — we'll 
see. Have popcorn, sitting back and watching the show 0 
Just got a big promotion to Manager of Senior Health, Virginia Hospital Center/Mayo Clinic. Am very excited, and love 
the job — it is so rewarding. I spend most of my time giving lectures on neurodegenerative diseases, sleep, heart health 
and strategies for longevity. And the rest of the time as liaison to **State** and local Department's of Aging, facilitator to 
the Alzheimer and Dementia Caregiver Support Group and managing the assistive technology program. 
If you hear of any special panels or commissions **President Trump** is forming, please keep me in mind. Sure the hospital 
won't mind loaning me out, and pretty sure I'm one of a handful of Republican Gerontologists 0. 
Let me know if you get to DC. Would LOVE to see you!!! 
Miss you and all the great times we had xxxx 
PS. How are **Fred** and Mort doing? 
Gerontologist, Longevity & Successful Aging
