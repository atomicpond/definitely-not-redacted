Sorry again for that **last minute** cancellation in the Spring -- alas, 
the perils of running a new center, that I no longer control my 
schedule like in the good old days. But the Obama **Brain** Initiative is 
running strong, and **MIT** has a good bid for a seat at the table, so 
that is good. Want to revisit a time for a chat? My schedule is now 
much more free, thanks to these **Brain** initiative activities 
launching... 
Best, 
Ed
