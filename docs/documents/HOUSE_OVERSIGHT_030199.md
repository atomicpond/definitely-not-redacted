## Document Text

In **1994**, **Trump** took a **13-year-old** girl to a party with **Jeffrey **Epstein****, a billionaire 
who was a notorious registered sex offender, and raped her that night in what was a 
"savage sexual attack," according to a lawsuit filed in **June **2016**** by "**Jane Doe**." The 
account was corroborated by a witness in the suit, who claimed to have watched as the 
child performed various sexual acts on **Trump** and **Epstein** even after the two were 
advised she was a minor. 
"Immediately following this rape **Defendant **Trump**** threatened me that, were I ever to 
reveal any of the details of Defendant Trumpaems sexual and physical abuse of me, my 
family and I would be physically harmed if not killed," **Jane Doe** wrote in the lawsuit, 
filed in **New York**.
