To: **Jeffrey Epstein** <jeevacation@gmail.com> 
**Dear Jeffrey**, 
**Woody** has received from his lawyer some questions I asked in in response to the agreement Irwin Tenenbaum 
sent me... .1 found that that agreement generous and reasonable (!), and I'm excited to go forward, but I do need 
those clarifications. We can absolutely agree that we will not give **Woody** larger or more important billing than 
Bill Clinton or **Joe Biden**, and that I'd like to come to him to renew our agreement after **five years**. 
The **Harvard** week of content in which **Woody** will appear, if we can sign this, needs to be edited in the next 
week-10 days. We are out of time, which is why I'm writing 
The television show has been picked up by **American Public Television**, they will distribute nationally, and 
they've asked for another 5 episodes. I so want **Woody** to be one of those. 
I'd like to see the haiku written by computer. Haiku is not that hard. I'd like to see an elegy written by 
computer.
