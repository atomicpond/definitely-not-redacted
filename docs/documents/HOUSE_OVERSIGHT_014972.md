US
Extract alpha from summer SPX range as policy and positioning “collar” equities
With the Federal Reserve last week appearing more emboldened to normalize monetary
policy, risk asset bears have come out in force. While we agree that a changing Fed
reaction function is likely not supportive of substantial equity upside, we think the
“Yellen put” still exists, albeit with a lower strike. Hence, we see monetary policy as
providing a near-term “collar” (long put/short call) on a US equity market already prone
to getting trapped in record-tight trading ranges. Further impetus for a summer rangetrade
should come from (i) fiscal policy, as gridlock caps equity upside but policy hope
floors the downside, and (ii) positioning, where the risk of continued “fragility events”
(potentially exacerbated by stretched quant fund/short vol positioning) meets cashed-up
investors still accustomed to buying dips. As a risk-limited range trade, we like buying
in-the-money down and out puts on the S&P. For example, an SPX Sep 2475 put that
knocks out at 2300 (6% OTM) indicatively costs 70bps (spot ref 2451), a 60% discount
to the 2475 / 2300 put spread.
Europe
Long EU banks dispersion: Buy Dec17 call on a basket, sell worst-of call
We recommend positioning for greater dispersion in EU bank sector returns via buying a
Dec17 105% call on an equally-weighted basket of Santander, BNP, ING, Intesa and
Deutsche Bank, part-financed by selling a worst-of call on the same basket for 1.8%
(net) indic., as: 1) improving macro/earnings, sensitivity to rates and regulatory
headwinds are likely to lead to greater differentiation within banks, 2) the entry point is
attractive given historically low implied vol (13 th 8y+ percentile) and high implied
correlation (81% bid vs latest 6M realised correl of 66%), 3) historical risk-reward at
current pricing is attractive (avg. P&L of +8.4% when positive vs -1.8% when negative),
and 4) the trade can be considered as a cheap call on EU equities as it has a similar
payoff profile but with greater benefit relative to its cost.
Asia
Buy depressed China vs. US risks through corridor variance spreads
As global central banks have taken on more hawkish tones, the uncertainty surrounding
policy tightening will be more positive for EM volatility than for DM volatility.
Additionally, our strategists have a more bearish outlook for the Chinese banking sector
(which makes up a majority of the HSCEI index) amid rapidly rising leverage, complex
shadow banking, and excessive home price inflation. Since we believe the global
synchronized monetary tightening will impact HSCEI volatility more than SPX volatility,
we recommend owning HSCEI-SPX 70/110% corridor variance at 5 vol points, a 3 vol
point discount to a vanilla variance spread. The entry point is attractive as the HSCEI-
SPX 18-month variance swap spread has fallen back to the lower-end of its 5-year
trading range, the trade has a positive carry, and it benefits during China risk-off events.
