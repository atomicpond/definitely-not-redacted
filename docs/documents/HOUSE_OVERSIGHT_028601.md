450 and owes about 300 and seems disinclined to make **Steptoe** whole.....hhhhhmmmm....first reaction is déjà vu.... 
How the fuck are we back here after the unspeakably awful evan barr debacle.... More to the point just tell me 
where you are on this....did **Miller** fuck up? Something else? As you know I am the 800 pound gorilla here, **Steptoe** 
is not going to chase you down for the money but there are 500 lawyers here, processes, etc......
