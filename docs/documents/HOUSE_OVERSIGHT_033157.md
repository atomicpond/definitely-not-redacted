HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033157

The Palm Beach finance crowd can paddleboard whenever they please. 
Behind a semicircular brick drive and a lawn as manicured as a putting 
green sits a 30,000-square-foot masterpiece of Italian Renaissance 
architecture called Casa Nana. 
John Porter, a **Real Estate** associate for Corcoran who oversees some of the 
largest sales in **Palm Beach County**, **Florida**, points out the spiral staircase, 
built by famed 19205 architect Addison Mizner for the founder of the 
National Tea Company. "This home went for $30.2 million in **2003**; **today** 
that sum wouldn't be in the top 25 highest prices" of houses for sale in this 
area, Porter says. "Palm Beach **Real Estate** has gone from nothing going on to 
nothing left to sell." 
Porter is giving me a tour of the so-called Billionaire's Row, a stretch of 
South Ocean Boulevard on the island of Palm Beach that is bordered by 
some of the highest hedges I've ever seen. Through gaps in the greenery 
appear stone fountains, elephant statues, pools the size of tennis complexes 
(next to actual tennis complexes), and more clay roofs than one could count. 
It's a monumental display of wealth, and it is rapidly expanding, not just 
here but in **Delray Beach**, **Jupiter**, Palm Beach Gardens and **Boca Raton**, as 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033158 
money pours out of the Northeast (and in some cases, from as far as **London** 
and **Singapore**) and into this already wealthy section of southeast **Florida**. 
Approximately 70 hedge and private equity funds are now headquartered 
here, many of which have set up shop in **the last two years**, jacking up home 
prices and spurring a countywide initiative to become, as some have said, 
"the new **Greenwich**." 
For hedge fund managers who might normally be inclined toward 
Westchester or **Connecticut**, the allure of **South **Florida**** is as plain as grits 
on toast. The homes are sprawling; the Intracoastal Waterway is a yachter's 
paradise. It has a glittering social scene. During high season—**October** 
through **March**—there might be several fundraisers on any given night. 
Perhaps the key factor, however: **In **Florida****, there are no individual income 
taxes, no estate taxes and no capital gains taxes. A hedge fund manager 
reporting $1 million in income can expect to pay only the federal 
government, whereas his counterpart living in **Connecticut** pays that plus an 
extra $67,000. And if the poor schmuck were still in **New York City**? He'd 
better be ready to fork over $104,300. 
As for why all of this is happening now, when **Florida** has long been a sunny 
tax haven, so to speak, financiers point to the upcoming application of 
Section 457A of **the Internal Revenue Code**. Before 457A was enacted, 
certain fees and related earnings could grow tax deferred in offshore 
accounts for up to ten years. But now, according to the section, hedge fund 
managers will need to funnel all of the fees that were deferred before **2009** 
and their related earnings back into the U.S. by 2017. If a manager lives in 
**Florida** when this happens, he's much less likely to pay exorbitant state 
taxes on the whole amount. If he still lived in **New York City**? 
Fuggedaboudit. 
It's the job of Kelly Smallridge, president and CEO of the Palm Beach 
**Business Development** Board, to ensure that hedge fund and private equity 
managers are informed of these benefits, in the hopes that they, and their 
firms, will become **Palm Beach County**'s newest residents. She's developed a 
red-carpet tour that goes beyond looking at office space and **Real Estate** to 
include meeting headmasters at private schools, the school-district 
superintendent and the mayor and speaking with the governor's staff and 
CEOs who have moved their operations here. Plus, of course, a few nights 
on the town.

In **the winter**, when the well-to-do from all over the Northeast visit **Florida** 
for charity balls, the board hosts dinners and parties for prospective 
relocators and local captains of industry. **last year**, Smallridge and 
company sponsored a soiree aboard a $70 million yacht that featured Veuve 
Clicquot, caviar and live jazz. Guests—who included the CEOs of a national 
IT company, a major finance company and a land developer, venture 
capitalists, hedge fund managers and the creator of ****Goldman Sachs****' prime 
brokerage division—took private tours with the captain of the yacht. 
Smallridge is also working with
