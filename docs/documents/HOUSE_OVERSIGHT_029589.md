Dear **Ms. Williams**: 
Tel:

I am writing now to invite you to be a featured guest on my public 
television series, Poetry in **America** (poetryinamerica.org). If you 
agree, we'll spend **45 minutes** at a location of your choice 
discussing a contemporary poem by Sharon Olds that compares 
feats of athletic prowess to childbirth. I will use what we capture in 
an upcoming season of Poetry in **America**, and I'll also use this 
content in a course for medical professionals I am creating in 
partnership with ****Harvard Medical School****. 
Poetry in **America**'s first season's guests included **Joe Biden**, 
**Cynthia Nixon**, Shaquille O'Neal, **Yo Yo Ma**, **Samantha Power**, 
**Herbie Hancock**, **John McCain**, Bill Clinton, **Nas**, **Angela Duckworth**, 
Bono, Regina Spektor, **Frank Gehry**, **Stuart Weitzman**, **E.O. Wilson** 
as well as 12 of the most distinguished poets of our time. Seasons 
Two and Three will have a similar line up. The series air on most 
public television stations, streams on ****Amazon** Prime** and is now 
airing on a variety of domestic and international airlines. I thank 
you for considering this request. I would be very honored to work 
with you. 
Sincerely, 
**Elisa New**
