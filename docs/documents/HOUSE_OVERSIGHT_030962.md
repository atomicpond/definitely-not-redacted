Subject: **Alex **Acosta**** update I Power Line

**Alex **Acosta**** update 
**earlier this week**, pedophile **Jeffrey **Epstein**** bought his way out of a lawsuit that would 
have given some of his victims the opportunity to testify about his predatory and criminal 
conduct. Victims never got that opportunity when **Epstein** faced criminal charges, because 
Alex Acosta___then the lead prosecutor, now the Secretary of Labor___let **Epstein** off with 
a ridiculously lenient sentence. Despite having committed hideous sex offenses with dozens 
of minors, **Epstein** received a sentence of **13 months** in jail, during which he was often free 
during **the day**. 
**Epstein**'s decision to buy his out of the civil lawsuit, one that he had the nerve to initiate, 
benefits **Acosta**. The trial would have provided non-stop headlines, coupled with frequent 
references to the sweetheart deal **Acosta** gave him. As Randy Schultz puts it, the trial would 
have been the occasion for a long overdue public shaming of **Acosta**. Now, he avoids this 
consequence. 
But this doesn't mean **Acosta** is out of the woods. He faces calls for his ouster from the 
**Trump** cabinet. 
Some calls are from the usual suspects. Michelle Goldberg of **the New York Times** has 
written a piece so obnoxious that it almost makes me want to see **Acosta** ride out the storm. 
But some conservatives are also advocating **Acosta**'s departure. Concerned Women for 
**America** is a stalwart conservative organization. It describes itself, accurately, as "focus[ed] 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 030962 
on seven core issues: the family, the sanctity of human life, religious liberty, education, 
sexual exploitation, national sovereignty, and support for **Israel**." (Emphasis added) 
Its leader, Penny Nance, has called for **Acosta**'s resignation. Noting that labor trafficking, 
which **the Labor Department** combats, is often conjoined with sex trafficking, Nance says 
that President **Trump** would not have nominated **Acosta** if reports fully describing **Acosta**'s 
conduct in the **Epstein** case had emerged earlier. 
Sen. **Ben **Sasse**** has also weighed in. He sent a letter to **the Justice Department** asking it to 
investigate its treatment of **Epstein**, including the fact that the plea deal ensured that victims 
of the pervert would be denied the ability to comment on or object to the leniency of his 
sentence. **Sasse** is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Oversight, 
Agency Action, Federal Rights and **Federal Courts**. 
Sen. **Marco **Rubio****, a longtime supporter of **Acosta**, says it would be "very troubling" if 
political influence led to a light sentence for **Epstein**. In **Rubio**'s view, and that of every 
rational person, **Epstein** "should have been in jail for a long time." **Rubio** added, however, 
that he will reserve judgment until he hears **Acosta**'s side. 
That's fair. But so far, **Acosta** has provided no real defense for letting **Epstein** off so lightly. 
In public, at least, he is standing by his argument that the deal was a reasonable one and that 
this is old news. 
Previously, **Acosta** had a different defense. He cited "a **year-long** assault on the prosecution 
and the prosecutors" by "an army of legal superstars" who represented **Epstein**. This 
allegedly included "defense counsel investigat[ing] individual prosecutors and their 
families, looking for personal peccadilloes that may provide a basis for disqualification." In 
this account, the deal was made to relieve the pressure, while still getting a conviction. 
**Acosta** could hardly assert this explanation____i.e., that he wimped out___while seeking a 
cabinet position with the expectation of being appointed to more exalted jobs in the future. 
Nor is the explanation particularly plausible. **Acosta** isn't the first prosecutor to face a 
scorched earth defense. Ask **Ken **starr**** about this. 
I don't doubt that **Acosta** regarded escaping the wrath of the defense team as a benefit of 
reaching the plea deal. But I don't believe this was incentive enough to cause him, in effect, 
to throw the case. 
What was the true incentive? As I wrote when this story broke, I think it was the same 
incentive that explains much of his conduct in public life___Acosta's desire to 
accommodate people he thinks can help him down the road. 
Which people? Probably the lawyers at **KIRKLAND** and Ellis, where **Acosta** had once worked. 
**Epstein** enlisted **Ken **starr***** and **Jay **Lefkowitz****, both of **KIRKLAND**, for his defense team. 
**Acosta** reportedly worked out the terms of his surrender with **Lefkowitz**, a former 
colleague, at a meeting in a location far away from the prosecutor's office. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 030963 
The location of the meeting is itself suspicious. Prosecutors
