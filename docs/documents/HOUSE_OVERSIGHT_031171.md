﻿8 The **Virgin Islands** Daily News 
**Justice Department** 
opens **Epstein** probe 
**the Associated Press** 
**Fort Lauderdale**, **FLA**. — 
**the **Justice Department**** has opened 
an investigation into federal prosecu-
tors' handling of a plea deal in which a 
wealthy, politically connected Virgin 
Islands financier avoided potentially 
severe penalties for sexually abusing 
teenage girls in favor of a relatively 
light state conviction in **Florida**. 
The depart-
ment's Office 
of Professional 
Responsibility 
wrote in a letter 
**Wednesday** to 
US. Sen. Ben 
**Sasse**, R-Nebras-
ka, that it would 
examine whether 
professional mis- **Jeffrey **Epstein**** 
conduct occurred in the highly publi-
cized case of **Jeffrey **Epstein****. The let-
ter cited a series of recent articles by 
**the Miami Herald** that focused new 
attention on how the deal came about. 
**Sasse**, a member of the **Senate** 
Judiciary Committee who has twice 
asked **the **Justice Department**** to in-
vestigate the case, welcomed the 
news. 
"**Jeffrey **Epstein**** is a child rapist 
and there's not a single mom or dad in 
**America** who shouldn't be horrified 
by the fact that he received a patheti-
cally soft sentence," **Sasse** said in an 
email. "The victims of **Epstein** 's child 
sex trafficking ring deserve this inves-
tigation — and so do the American 
people and members of law enforce-
ment who work to put these kinds of 
monsters behind bars." 
**Epstein**, who also has homes in 
**Palm Beach**, **FLA**., and **New York**, 
lives on Little St. James Island off St. 
Thomas. 
**Epstein**, now 66, reached a non-
prosecution deal in **2008** with then-
Miami US. Attorney Alexander 
**Acosta**'s office to secretly end a fed-
eral sex abuse investigation involving 
at least 40 teenage girls that could 
have landed him behind bars for life. 
He instead pleaded guilty to state 
charges, spent **13 months** in jail, paid 
settlements to victims and is a regis-
tered sex offender. 
**Acosta**, now President Donald 
Trump's labor secretary, has defend-
ed the deal as appropriate but has not 
commented since the recent round of 
stories. He was asked about the case 
during his **Senate** confirmation hear-
ings for the **Cabinet** post. 
Some of his accusers are pursuing 
a separate legal effort to nullify the 
plea agreement.
