------------------------------------------------------------------------X
RADAR ONLINE LLC :
Plaintiff, :
- v. - :
****Federal Bureau** of Investigation**, :
Defendant. :
------------------------------------------------------------------------X
COMPLAINT
1. This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552 (“FOIA”), to order
the production of ****Federal Bureau** of Investigation** (“FBI”) records concerning the agency’s
investigation and prosecution of financier **Jeffrey Edward Epstein** (“Epstein”) for sexually
trafficking underage women. Defendant FBI has withheld these records despite a properly
filed FOIA request.
PARTIES
2. Plaintiff Radar Online LLC (“Radar”) is an online investigative news outlet read by millions.
3. The FBI, a component of **the Department of Justice**, is an agency of **the United States** with
possession and control of the records sought by Plaintiff.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
4. This court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. §
552(a)(4)(B).
5. Radar’s principal place of business is **New York City** and therefore venue is appropriate
1
Case **1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document** 1 Filed 05/25/17 Page 2 of 3
under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B).
FACTS
Background of Request
6. **Jeffrey Epstein** is a billionaire financier, philanthropist, and sex offender. In 2005, Epstein
became the subject of an undercover sex trafficking investigation by **Palm Beach**, Florida
police and the FBI. Dozens of underage women were trafficked by Epstein to perform sexual
acts on him as well as his friends.
7. Despite the gravity of his offenses, **the Department of Justice** allowed Epstein to plead guilty
to a single count of soliciting prostitution from a minor under Florida state law, and serve
only 13 months in prison. In addition, prosecutors agreed not to bring charges against
Epstein’s alleged co-conspirators.
8. Mr. Epstein enjoyed close ties to numerous prominent political figures, including former
President Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew of the **British **Royal Family****, leading many to
speculate whether he received preferential treatment from authorities. See Goodnough, Abby,
“Questions of Preferential Treatment Are Raised **In Florida** Sex Case,” **the New York Times**,
Sep. 3, 2006. (Exhibit A)
FOIA Request and Constructive Denial
9. On April 20, 2017 James Robertson, a Senior Editor for **the National Enquirer** and sisterpublication
Radar Online, submitted a FOIA request to the FBI for all documents relating to
the investigation and prosecution of Epstein (the “Request”). (Exhibit B)
10. Robertson requested expedited processing because Epstein’s crimes are the subject of
widespread and exceptional media interest, and raise questions about the government's
integrity, which affects public confidence; specifically, whether Mr. Epstein received
2
Case **1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document** 1 Filed 05/25/17 Page 3 of 3
preferential treatment from authorities due to his wealth, connections, and political leverage.
11. The FBI has provided no response to Mr. Robertson’s request, nor even assigned it a tracking
number. By failing to provide - or formally deny - documents within twenty working days,
the FBI has constructively denied the request under 5 U.S. Code § 552(a)(6)(A)(ii).
CAUSE OF ACTION
Violation of the Freedom of Information Act for Wrongful Withholding of Agency Records
12. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1-11.
13. Defendant FBI has wrongfully withheld agency records requested by Plaintiff.
14. Plaintiff has exhausted all administrative remedies.
REQUESTED RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests this Court:
(A) Order defendant to provide access to the requested documents in their entirety;
(B) Expedite this proceeding as provided for in 28 U.S.C. § 1657;
(C) Award plaintiff costs and reasonable attorney fees in this action, as provided in 5
U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(E); and
(D) Grant such other and further relief as may deem just and proper.

Questions of Preferential Treatment Are
Raised **In Florida** Sex Case
By ABBY GOODNOUGH SEPT. 3, 2006
**Palm Beach**, Fla. — In **the summer and autumn of last year**, when most of the
mansions here stood empty behind their towering hedges, the police stealthily
watched one at the end of a waterside lane. They monitored the comings and goings
of its owner’s private jet, subpoenaed his phone records and riffled through his
trash.
The owner was **Jeffrey Epstein**, 53, an intensely private New York money
manager with several billionaire clients. **Months earlier**, the stepmother of a 14­yearold
girl told the **Palm Beach** police that a wealthy older man, whom the girl la
