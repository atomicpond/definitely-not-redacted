Chief Investment Office 
Capital Market Outlook from our Chief Investment Office 
delivers a balanced mix of macroeconomic insights and 
global market views, with in-depth analysis from the **CIO**'s 
investment strategists and analysts. It offers timely 
commentary that can help you navigate markets and take 
advantage of emerging trends across the globe. 
This **week**'s topics are: 
• Macro Strategy: Why 2%? — While Federal 
Reserve policy has always been focused on the goal of 
price stability, the specific meaning of price stability has 
been refined over **the years** from a general and non-
specified, vague concept to the current very specific 
quantitative definition of a 2% long-run average for the 
personal consumption expenditures deflator. We describe 
the evolution and rationale for the more specific target. 
• Global Market View: Global R&D: From **Apollo**, 
to **Apple**, to **Alibaba**? — The recent unfolding tech cold 
war between the U.S. and **China** will likely only accelerate 
the pace of spending on global research and development 
as the two parties vie for technological supremacy. **China** 
faces significant technological hurdles, while the U.S. 
needs to rethink and rebalance the role of public and 
private sector research and development spending. 
• Thought of the **week**: A Golden Diversifier — 
Gold's recent outperformance versus the U.S. dollar has 
potentially triggered a bullish technical pattern. In our

view, the market's expectation for looser monetary policy 
together with recent comments by **President Trump** 
implying a desire for a weaker greenback have been 
tailwinds. In addition to these drivers, we view gold as an 
appealing diversifier in light of elevated geopolitical risks. 
However, a comprehensive trade deal between the U.S. 
and **China** would likely constitute a more significant 
headwind for the yellow metal.

made in emerging markets. Investments in a certain industry or sector may pose additional risk due to 
lack of diversification and sector concentration. There are special risks associated with an investment in
