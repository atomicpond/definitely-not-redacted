Subject: Fwd: URGENT: **BuzzFeed News** inquiry re allegations of sexual harassment 
Attachments: DA866543-7401-4A5A-8E50-FD32E33A5OEC.png 
Importance: High 
First draft: 
It is hard to know how to respond to a list of false and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading statements 
on your part. Needless to say, I treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard to support and mentor 
students, colleagues, and members of the general public. I do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your 
reporting is to somehow argue that that Universities and other institutions are lax in dealing with well known 
individuals like myself, then in fact the situation is quite the opposite. My high public profile opens me up to 
more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also opens me up to a host of outside complaints and 
allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which **The University** has to respond to. The fact that I have 
remained a professor in all Universities with which I have been associated, in good standing, and also an officer 
or an invited speaker at organizations like CFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the 
fact that they trust my behavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and invited to their last 3 
meetings to speak, specifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally 
appreciated my talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the purpose of your 
report is to impugn my integrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of 
your 'miscellaneous facts', as a scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than 
allegations and innuendo. I also try and judge the facts in context. The fact that Universities and other 
organizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is because they value my 
contributions and my actions. 
Your specific allegations are false or distorted. Item 1 refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 
2006 where we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be 
appropriate, and had respectful encounters afterwards. I cannot comment on item 3, which involves an 
anonymous 3rd party claim, because I know nothing about it, and it was not taken seriously enough to result in 
any university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because I decided I didn't want to go out to a 
bar with a group of attendees that I was harassing them? The second part is false. I don't do that. Re incident 
5: The 'female companion' in this case is my wife, who can attest to the fact that the claim is false, which is 
what I wrote in response to the blog in question, causing it to be taken down. 
It is worthwhile responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail, 
Re item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came 
to me or wrote to me with questions. When she asked about advice for after graduation I DID tell her she was 
different than the other students in her year. The rest of them were interested in going on to graduate school, 
but she was interested in science communication so I told her that she might want to take a different path. Since 
she was the only woman in her year, as I recall, I did ask her on one of these occasions if that made it difficult 
for her in any way. I asked, because as a faculty member I was interested, and also because as someone she had 
asked for career advice from I wanted to know if that made a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. I have 
gone back over emails from that period. I have numerous requests from her to go for coffee to talk, which I 
usually had to turn down because I was busy, including several occasions where she asked me to have coffee 
with her off campus to talk, and I politely declined. I did let her accompany me off campus one time to watch 
me do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it. I did and do have coffee and meals with students

on campus, and I see nothing wrong with this. I was shocked when I later learned of her complaint, not least 
because there was no inappropriate interaction and also because well after the date on which she is said to have 
been offended, she continued to email me with joking questions or comments, and at a AAAS conference in 
2008, for which she had asked, and for which I had written her a letter of recommendation to attend, my wife 
and I gave her a lift well out out of our way to drop her off at her hotel, and I note in an email response to her 
email about the conference, agin in 2008, I expressed that I would pass her regards along to my wife and vice 
versa. When the Un
