Carried Interest 
Camp's Tax Plan Hits Wall Street 
With Change in Carried Interest Treatment 
By Brett Ferguson 
Investment fund managers would take a hit on their tax bills under ****HOUSE** Ways** 
and **Means Committee** Chairman **Dave Camp**'s (R-Mich.) proposal to dramatically 
reshape the treatment of carried interest income. 
Under current law, the share of long-term investment gains that fund managers 
are allowed to keep for themselves as compensation is treated as capital gains and taxed at about half 
the rate of ordinary income. **President **Barack Obama**** has called for that income, known as carried 
interest, to be taxed at ordinary income tax rates, saying the payments are more like income from a 
service performed than a return on investment. 
Camp, while taking a softer line than the president, says he agrees. 
"A partnership (e.g., private equity fund) that is in the business of raising capital, investing in other 
businesses, developing such businesses, and ultimately selling them, is in the trade or business of selling 
businesses. The businesses bought and sold by the partnership are its inventory," according to a detailed 
summary of Camp's proposal. 
The summary said to apply the tax law consistently, the profits derived by such an investment 
partnership and paid to its managing partners through management fees and a profits interest in the 
partnership should be treated as ordinary income. 
But the Camp proposal also takes into account the technicalities of such businesses, excluding 
partnerships engaged in the real estate business, and applying a recharacterization formula to partners 
earning carried interest to take into account any share of invested capital they may own. 
According to the proposal, an applicable partnership interest would include any interest transferred, 
directly or indirectly, to a partner in connection with the performance of services by the partner, 
provided that the partnership is engaged in a trade or business conducted on a regular, continuous and 
substantial basis consisting of raising or returning capital, identifying, investing in, or disposing of other 
trades or businesses, and developing such trades or businesses. 
Recharacterization Formula Applied 
The recharacterization formula "generally would treat the service partner's applicable share of the 
invested capital of the partnership as generating ordinary income by multiplying that share by a specified 
rate of return (the Federal long-term rate plus 10 percentage points), intended to approximate the 
compensation earned by the service partner for managing the capital of the partnership," the proposal 
said. 
Under the plan, the recharacterization amount would be determined, but not realized, on an **annual** basis 
and tracked over time. 
"To the extent a service partner contributes capital to the partnership, the result would be less capital 
gain being characterized as ordinary income. Any distribution or gain from the sale of a partnership 
interest (i.e., a realization event) then would be treated as ordinary to the extent of the partner's 
recharacterization account balance for the tax year. Amounts in excess of the recharacterization account 
balance would be capital gain," the proposal said.

In a Feb. 25 article written for **The **Wall Street Journal****, Camp said the proposal "can clean up provisions 
like 'carried interest' that allow certain private-equity firms to get the investment-income tax rate on 
what anyone else would call normal wage income." 
Benchmark for Future Bills? 
The carried-interest proposal comes on top of a Camp plan to impose a tax on the assets of the largest 
U.S. banks and insurers. Even though his plan faces long odds in **Congress** **this year**, the proposal will 
become a benchmark for tax policy. 
Under current law, carried interest, or the profits share received by private equity managers, gets 
treated as capital gains, with a top basic rate of 20 percent as opposed to the ordinary income rate of 
39.6 percent. 
Obama and other Democrats have been trying since **2007** to change that law with little success. Camp is 
wrapping a change to carried interest inside a reconstruction of the tax code that would lower tax rates 
and broaden the tax base. 
**steve** Judge, president and chief executive officer of the Private Equity Growth Capital Council, an 
industry trade group, said Camp's proposal was "disappointing." 
"Key policy makers from both parties have already made clear that the discussion around this draft 
proposal will be brief," Judge
