Any further intel on **Treasury**? **Priebus** choice suggests to me that he may go for a bigger name in 
**Treasury** than **MNUCHIN**. Someone to underscore/push forward this notion that he is **Reagan** 2.0 (as 
some are suggesting). I am just not sure who that person would be. **The Trump** trade certainly seems 
to have legs -- all the **hillary** loving hedgies I am talking to are congratulating themselves for making 
so much money **last week**. They are all Trump lovers now!
