The Ayatollah Always Says No  
Editorial 
February 8, 2013 --The Farsi word for "no" is na h, which is easy enough 
to remember. Maybe even Joe Biden won't forget it the next time the U.S. 
tries to reach out diplomatically to Iran. 
We're speaking of the **Administration**'s latest effort to come to terms with 
Tehran over its nuclear programs, which Mr. Biden made last weekend at 
the Munich Security Conference. The U.S. offer of direct bilateral talks, 
he said, "stands, but it must be real and tangible." Iranian foreign minister 
**Ali Akbar Salehi**, who was also at the conference though he refused to 
meet with U.S. officials, called Mr. Biden's comments "a step forward." 
Mr. Salehi's remark set the usual hearts aflutter that Iran is finally serious 
about a deal. But the optimism was brief On Thursday, Iran's Supreme 
Leader **Ayatollah Ali Khamenei** flatly rejected direct talks with the U.S. 
"The U.S. is pointing a gun at Iran and wants us to talk to them," he said. 
"Direct talks will not solve any problems." 
This isn't the first time Mr. Khamenei has played chaste Daphne to 
**President Obama**'s infatuated Apollo. Just after becoming President in 
2009, Mr. Obama sent the Ayatollah two private letters and delivered a 
conciliatory speech for the Persian new year of Nowruz. Mr. Khamenei's 
answer: "They chant the slogan of change but no change is seen in 
practice." He told a crowd chanting "death to America" that "if a hand is 
stretched covered with a velvet glove but it is cast iron inside, that makes 
no sense." 
That was in March 2009. In October of that year the U.S. and its allies 
tentatively worked out a deal with Iranian negotiators to move some of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028728 
their enriched uranium outside Iran. Western analysts were confident that 
Mr. Khamenei would give his blessing, given the international pressure he 
was said to be under following the fraudulent elections and the bloody 
crackdown that followed. 
The Ayatollah quashed that deal too: "Whenever they [Americans] smile 
at the officials of the Islamic revolution, when we carefully look at the 
situation, we notice that they are hiding a dagger behind their back." 
It was the same in January 2011, when diplomacy also collapsed. Ditto in 
2012, when negotiations in February, May and June each ended in failure. 
Washington went into those talks thinking they were going to succeed on 
the theory that Tehran desperately wants relief from the supposedly 
crippling pressure of economic sanctions. 
Why does the Ayatollah keep saying no? The conventional wisdom is that 
previous U.S. offers weren't generous enough, or that the wrong President 
was in ****the White House****, or that Iran wants only to deal directly with the 
U.S. and not in multilateral forums. Each of these theories has been tested 
and shown to be false. 
A more persuasive explanation—get ready for this shocker—is that Iran 
really wants a bomb. The regime believes, not unreasonably, that 
**Moammar Gadhafi** would still be in power had he not given up his nuclear 
program in 2003. Mr. Khamenei also fears a "velvet revolution" scenario, 
in which more normal ties with the West threaten the ideological 
foundations of **the **Islamic Republic****. Confrontation with America is in this 
regime's DNA. 
Meantime, the pretense of negotiations has allowed Tehran to play for 
time to advance its programs. When Mr. Obama took office, Iran had 
enriched 1,000 kilos of reactor-grade uranium. In its last report from 
November, U.N. inspectors found that Iran has produced 7,611 kilos to 
reactor grade, along with 232 kilos of uranium enriched to 20%, which is 
close to bomb-grade. Last month, Iran declared that it would install 3,000 
advanced centrifuges at its Natanz facility, which can enrich uranium at 
two to three times its current rate. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028729 
As for the sanctions, they may hurt ordinary Iranians but this regime is 
famously indifferent to the suffering of its own people. The Ayatollah also 
doesn't seem to take the **Administration**'s talk about "all options being on 
the table" seriously. Mr. Obama's nomination of Iran dove Chuck Hagel to 
be Secretary of Defense reinforces that impression, as do reports that the 
White House blocked Pentagon and CIA plans to arm the opposition that's 
fighting to overthrow Iran's client regime in Damascus. An America that 
won't help proxies in a proxy war isn't likely to take the fight directly to 
Iran's nuclear facilities. 
In rejecting Mr. Biden's offer, the Ayatollah said frankly, "I'm not a 
diplomat; I'm a revolutionary." Another round of multilateral talks with 
Iran is set to resume this month, but maybe Joe Biden and his boss should 
start taking no for an answer.
