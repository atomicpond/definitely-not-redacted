****China** Daily**» CHINADAILY.COM.CN/NATION
Developing nations in Central **Asia**, **Europe**,
**Southeast **Asia****, **Africa** and other regions need
to have our news perspectives and voices heard.”

Tradeinitiativeis‘directionoffuture’
Expert: Belt and Road strategy will be
applauded **years** from now as visionary
ByTANGYUE in Xi’an
tangyue@chinadaily.com.cn
The first US presidential
debate might have been the
most­watched event around
the globe on **Monday** night
local time, with the expected
protectionist remarks made
by candidates Donald Trump
and Hillary Clinton.
Yet, at the same time, across
the Pacific Ocean, the Belt and
Road Initiative, launched by
**China** **three **years** ago** to foster
economic ties, gained momentum
as media from **China** and
abroad expressed support.
“I know many people think
the most important event
today is the debate, which is
going on right now,” Robert
Kuhn, a US expert on **China**
and a host on **China** Central
Television, said on **Tuesday** at
the media session of the International
Seminar on the Belt
and Road Initiative in Xi’an,
Shaanxi province.
“However, looking back in
50 **years** or **100 **years****, I believe
this is a more important event
than the debate because it
pushes forward an important
initiative that is the direction
of the future,” Kuhn said at the
two­day seminar. ****China** Daily**
is a co­organizer.
In **2013**, President Xi Jinping
proposed the **Silk Road**
Economic Belt, which
includes countries situated
on the original **Silk Road**,
passing through Central **Asia**,
West **Asia**, **the **Middle East****
and **Europe**, as well as the 21st
Century Maritime **Silk Road**,
which covers **Southeast **Asia****,
Oceania and **North **Africa****.
By **the end of June**, **China**
had signed cooperation agreements
with more than 30
countries regarding the initiativeandisworkingwithanother
20 on capacity building
projects in the manufacturing
sector, according to a report by
Renmin University of **China**.
“Some countries that start
to turn inward, start to talk
protectionism, seem to be
more skeptical about trade.
This initiative is moving in the
opposite direction. It promotes
cooperation and business
across the border,” said
Jason Eugene Subler, Greater
**China** bureau chief of **Reuters**.
Some100mediarepresentatives
from about 20 countries
attended the seminar and
reached a written consensus
to be “a champion of the Silk
Road Spirit”, referring friendship
and cooperation throughout
history, and to be “an
active supporter of the initiative”.
Wilson Flores, a columnist
at the Philippine Star newspaper,
said the initiative allows
the media in participating
countries to better cooperate
and to enrich the diversity of
media voices, which has long
been dominated by Western
news organizations.
“As we evolve into a more
diverse and multipolar world,
developing nations in Central
**Asia**, **Europe**, **Southeast **Asia****,
**Africa** and other regions need
to have our news perspectives
and voices heard.”
Kang Bing, deputy editor­inchief
of ****China** Daily**, suggested
that media organizations
along the route can jointly
identify topics to cover, develop
applications together,
co­produce microvideos and
launch special columns,
reports and web pages on the
platform of other countries.

Development of Guangdong,
**Hong Kong** and Macao, said
thebridgewillhelpHongKong
further expand its development
space when it advances
its cooperation with the vast
western part of the Pearl River
Delta region in Guangdong after
traffic begins to flow.
“The western partofthedelta
region, which includes the
prosperous cities of Zhuhai,
Zhongshan, Jiangmen, Yangjiang
and Taishan, still has huge
room for expansion and cooperation
with **Hong Kong**,”
Chen said on **Tuesday**.
“Meanwhile, Zhongshan,
the hometown of Dr Sun Yatsen;
and Jiangmen and Taishan,
the hometowns of myriad
overseas Chinese living
around the world, have rich
tourism resources for further
development,” he said.
“The bridge will help accelerate
the development of
****Hong Kong**’s** international airport
and its ports and the
development of ****Hong Kong**’s**
LantouIslandarea,” Chensaid.
It is also expected to help
****Hong Kong**’s** airport and ports
to attract more bus
