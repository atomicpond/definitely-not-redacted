CONFIDENTIAL SUBMISSION TO 
THE OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY 
ATTORNEY GENERAL 
RE J. EPSTEIN

John Roth, Esq. 
Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General 
Office of the Deputy Attorney General 
****United States** Department of Justice** 
**950 **Pennsylvania Avenue****, N.W., Room 4115 
Washington, D.C. 20530 
Dear Mr. Roth: 
Dir. Fax: 
I again want to thank you for this opportunity to explain why we believe that a federal 
prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein is unwarranted. I appreciate your having informed us that you 
already have our May 19 and May 27 communications to the Deputy Attorney General, as well 
as our prior written submissions to CEOS and to **the Southern District** of Florida. 
In light of the significant volume of our prior submissions and to facilitate your review, 
we have drafted four supplemental submissions that will provide a roadmap for your 
investigation of this matter. Given the bulk of these documents and their appended supporting 
attachments, you will receive this packet by messenger tomorrow. A brief description of each of 
the four submissions follows. First, I have included a succinct summary of the facts, law and 
policy issues at hand. This document sets forth a basic overview of the issues and summarizes 
our principal contentions as to why federal prosecution of this matter is neither appropriate nor 
warranted. 
The three other submissions include: a summary of the irregularities and misconduct that 
occurred during the federal investigation; a letter from former CEOS attorney Stephanie Thacker 
that responds to CEOS's assessment of its limited review of Mr. Epstein's case; and a point-by-
point rebuttal to **First Assistant** **United States** Attorney **Jeffrey Sloman**'s recent letter which we 
believe contains factual inaccuracies typical of our correspondence from **the **United States**** 
Attorney's Office in Miami (the "USAO"). Also, for your reference, the package you receive 
tomorrow will contain a binder including all documentation to which we refer in our 
submissions. Finally, we will be providing a detailed checklist of each submission or substantive 
communication to the USAO. Our intention is that you have copies of each such document to 
enhance your review. If there are any that you have not received from the USA() or CEOS, 
please advise and we will fedex them to you without delay.

As you are likely aware, the Department's prior review of this matter was incomplete 
and, by its own admission, not "de novo." See Tab 38, May 15, 2008 Letter from A. Oosterbaan. 
Without considering the Non Prosecution Agreement that left this matter to be resolved in the 
State or any of the misconduct, CEOS reviewers, tasked with reviewing some of their own 
previously expressed opinions, assessed only whether **the **United States**** Attorney would "abuse 
[his] discretion" if he pursued this case. While we appreciate CEOS 's willingness to examine 
these limited issues, its conclusion that a prosecution would not be an "abuse of discretion" rings 
particularly hollow in light of CEOS's admirably candid concessions that we have raised 
"compelling" objections and that a prosecution on these facts would require "novel" applications 
of federal law. Indeed, even a brief review of CEOS's own mission statement reveals how 
inapposite a federal prosecution is to the facts in this case. 
Importantly, we note that the CEOS review was conducted prior to ****the **Supreme Court****'s** 
very recent decisions in Santos and Cuellar, which we believe—illuminating as they do the 
Court's interpretive methodology when it comes to federal criminal law—powerfully 
demonstrate the substantive vulnerability of the USAO's unprecedented employment of three 
federal laws. That Office's interpretation would never pass muster under ****the **Supreme Court****'s** 
recent pronouncements and should not be countenanced. That is all the more true under the 
circumstances where the duly appointed U.S. Attorney opined that, in effect, the "unitary" 
****Executive Branch**** was driving this prosecution. We now know that is not so. 
What I respectfully request, and what I hope you will provide, is a truly "de novo" 
review—that is, an independent assessment of whether federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein is both 
necessary and warranted in view of the legal and evidentiary hurdles that have been identified, 
the existence of a State felony plea and sentence that have been advocated by the State Attorney 
for **Palm Beach County**, and the many issues of prosecutorial misconduct and overzealousness 
that have permeated the investigation. I also request that you provide us with the opportunity 
during your review to
