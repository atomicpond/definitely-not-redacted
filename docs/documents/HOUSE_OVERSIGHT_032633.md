Subject: Got another call from Connelly.. 
Importance: **High 
He** is digging around again -- not clear if its another book/or expanded paperback version. Was 
asking me all sorts of questions about why you hired **Ken Starr**. I told him I had no idea -- I think he is 
doing some **Trump**-related digging too. 
Anyway, for what its worth...
