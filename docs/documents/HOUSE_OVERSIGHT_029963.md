I'm up 50% on my BTC investment! 
Here's how Bitcoin charmed **Washington** 
BY TIMOTHY B. LEE 
• November 21 at 2:52 pm 
The Bitcoin Foundation's Patrick Murck testifies before the **Senate** **Homeland Security** and Government Affairs Committee. (U.S. 
**Senate**) 
The pair of Bitcoin hearings held **this **week**** by **Senate** committees could have been a disaster for the 
Bitcoin community. After all, Bitcoin first came to mainstream attention in **2011** when 
**Gawker** reported on **Silk Road**, an anonymous online marketplace that allowed users to purchase a wide 
variety of illegal drugs with Bitcoin. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) denounced the site and suggested 
that Bitcoin was "an online form of money laundering." **a few **months** ago**, it would have been easy to 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 029963 
imagine the first congressional hearings on Bitcoin being a prelude to a federal crackdown on the 
decentralized financial network. 
But that's not what happened. Instead, the hearings were lovefests. All three Obama administration 
officials who testified **this **week**** stressed that Bitcoin has legitimate uses and argued that no new 
regulations were needed to police illicit uses of the network. Most of the other witnesses echoed those 
sentiments. 
That wasn't a coincidence. The cordial atmosphere of **this **week****'s hearings was the culmination of 
**months** of careful diplomacy by Bitcoin advocates. Since **the spring**, leaders of the Bitcoin community 
and sympathetic policy advocates have been engaging with federal regulators, lawmakers and other 
influential figures inside the beltway. The result: a near-unanimous consensus that the federal 
government needs to be careful to avoid hampering the growth of the world's first completely 
decentralized payment network. 
A tough crowd 
On the morning of **June** 13, several dozen well-dressed Washingtonians filed into the Carlucci 
Auditorium at the stately headquarters of **the United States** Institute of Peace. For many of the 
government officials in the room, this would be their first opportunity to meet senior figures in the 
Bitcoin community in the flesh. Panelists included lead Bitcoin developer Gavin Andressen and 
Patrick Murck, general counsel of the Bitcoin Foundation. 
The way the event was framed didn't augur well for Bitcoin. One of the conference's two sponsors 
(along with Thompson Reuters) was the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children. A 
major theme of the second panel was the use of bitcoins to purchase child pornography. 
"Child pornography is like Bitcoin in some ways," said Andrew Oosterbaan, who prosecutes child 
pornography cases for **the Justice Department**. "It has intrinsic value to people who want it. The more 
valuable child pornography is the new child pornography. When you add an anonymous currency, 
you've taken individuals who are already incentivized to produce, given them a far more meaningful 
incentive to do so." 
"Bitcoin is nothing like child pornography," a visibly angry Murck shot back. "If there was one 
instance of a child being abused because of Bitcoin, that's one too many. I'm a father, I think there's a 
special place in hell for people who do that." 
But Murck also stressed that the Bitcoin community was willing to work with federal regulators to 
ensure that Bitcoin-based businesses complied with applicable laws. "I want to craft a sane regulatory 
environment," he said, urging federal regulators to "engage stakeholders. Don't have secret meetings. 
Have public meetings. We're all happy to live with the consequences of whatever rulemaking is open 
and transparent." 
Murck would get his wish for engagement, though many of the meetings would be held behind closed 
doors. "We always intended that conference to be a launching point," says Ernie Allen, the president 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 029964 
of the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children and an organizer of the **June** 
conference. The gathering catalyzed the creation of a task force to consider how policymakers should 
respond to Bitcoin's emergence. It is expected to issue its recommendations **early next year**. 
Allen says that conversations among members of that task force have changed how he thinks about 
the online payment network. Allen now believes that premature regulation would be 
counterproductive. 
"We are enthusiastic about the potential of virtual currencies and the digital economy," Allen said in 
his **Monday** testimony before the **Senate** Committee on **Homeland Security** and Governmental Affairs. 
Allen said he remained concerned about the use of the currency for exchanging child pornography, 
but he warned that "draconian" regulations could push Bitcoin enterprises underground and 
overseas, where it would be much harder to police for illicit uses.
