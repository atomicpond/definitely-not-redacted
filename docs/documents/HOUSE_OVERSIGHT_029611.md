Figuring out how. 
Could say she has now used up 80 percent of what she was owed through my changes in plan. 
Or say xi changes meeting w trump. 
I think she is tired of this alas. 
Sustaining w secrecy hard.

No I meant that thanking her will be wierd because we had **45 minutes** of friendly convo before the bit I 
described. 
I'll wait till tmrw and send her some article and then say some version of your msg. 
At some point need more firmness though.

Just send, happy for the time we spent together- have fun see you soon

I'm really mad at the deception. 
Should I just wait for her to call?

This guy different. Maybe married or old or something. I sense from body language she is really attracted but 
he is unsuitable as partner. 
I can hardly be possessive under circumstances but schedule changing because she gets a better offer is not 
acceptable. 
If I say this she will rage back about times I changed plans because of family and work constraints. 
She knew I was upset. I think significant chance she 11 send note saying this may not be fair to you why 
Not take time off or that she will say this. 
In her way very tough. 
But nothing for now.

We talked on phone. Then "I can't talk later". Dint think I can talk **tomorrow**". 
I said what are you up to. She said "I'm busy". I said awfully coy u are. 
And then I said. Did u really rearrange **the **weekend**** we were going to be together because guy number 3 
was coming" 
She said no his schedule changed after we changed our plans. 
I said ok I got to go call me when u feel like it. Tone was not of good feeling. 
I dint want to be in a gift giving competition while being the friend without benefits. 
Think time to just stay away for a while. If there is potential here she 11 find way back. 
I think I'm too eager weak at this point. The **Prada** thing by someone else is natural. By me seems 
desperate. 
Had good sense not to send off a note. 
She must be very confused or maybe wants to cut me off but wants professional connection a lot and so 
holds to it. 
I think life as stand by in case she needs leverage against another guy sucks. 
But I get when I think about it stay cool.

**On **Sat****, **Mar 16, 2019** at **1:59 PM** ****larry** Summers** < 
guy 3 seems to be in **London** for **weekend** which is why my visit cut short. 
I got mad. Didn't send angry note after call though. 
This is a ridiculous activity.
