OLIVIER SIBONY, AND CASS R. SUNSTEIN 30 MARKETS

**New York, NY**, Tuesday, March 20, **2018**– Max Brockman, CEO of Brockman, Inc. announced today the sale of NOISE by **Daniel Kahneman**, Olivier Sibony, and Cass R. Sunstein.

Kahneman, Sibony, and Sunstein were represented in the negotiations by **John Brockman** for US/Canadian rights, and Max Brockman, who supervised auctions in the UK and  foreign language markets.

According to Max Brockman, “We’ve never seen **a week** like this in the 45-year history of Brockman, Inc. Thirty auctions were conducted within **a week**, all setting new agency records for publishing advances in each market and, in many markets, at levels never seen before for a serious nonfiction book.”

“This speaks to the remarkable track record of Kahneman’s THINKING FAST AND SLOW, which has been on **the New York Times** Bestseller List since publication in 2011, with global sales approaching 6 million copies, 2 million of which are in the UK, making it the biggest nonfiction book in the 100-year history of Allen Lane/Penguin.” 

“Another factor in the extraordinary reaction by publishers worldwide are the expertise and skill sets that Olivier Sibony and Cass Sunstein bring to the project.

According to Tracy Behar, VP, Publisher, and Editor-in-Chief of Little, Brown Spark, who acquired US/Canadian rights to the book, “**Daniel Kahneman**, Olivier Sibony, and Cass Sunstein are three of the greatest thinkers of our time, and I believe NOISE will be one of our most influential books, with far-reaching applications. It’s an honor to be able to publish it.”
