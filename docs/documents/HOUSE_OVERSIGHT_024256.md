I. Course Description 
This course offers a rigorous introduction to the field of cyberlaw. We will investigate the 
evolving nature of online architecture and activities, and the ways in which law has been, and 
will be, leveraged to influence them. 
Course themes include the complex interaction between Internet governance organizations and 
sovereign states, the search for balance between the ease of disseminating information online 
and the interest of copyright holders, privacy advocates, and others in controlling that 
dissemination, and the roles of intermediaries and platforms in shaping what people can and 
cannot do online. The course will include an array of learning and teaching methods. Students 
will be expected to participate in a variety of activities.

The purpose of this class is to give students a sense of the historical battles of the Internet, what
