**Steve Bannon** trying to get on disgraced 
******Jeffrey** ****Epstein******'s** good side 
By Emily Smith 
**Steve Bannon** shared a secret meeting with reviled billionaire pedophile **Jeffrey** -****Epstein**** 
at the financier's notorious **Upper East Side** mansion. 
**Former **White **HOUSE****** chief strategist Bannon was spotted stepping out of his SUV and 
entering the registered sex offender's sprawling 21,000-square-foot mansion at 9 E. 71st 
St. shortly before 7 a.m. **Wednesday**. 
****Epstein****'s -palatial pad is one of his homes where young_girls were allegedly brought in to 
perform massages and used as "sex slaves." 
We assume Bannon wasn't there for a massage. 
Sources speculate that the disgraced -****Epstein**** wants to use his millions to work his way 
close to political power again. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 026314 
One told us, "Bannon needs money to bankroll his political agenda. ****Epstein**** has plenty of 
money, and craves power and access." 
Bannon made an early-**Morning** beeline to ****Epstein****, even though Bannon may have 
burned bridges when he savaged ****ivanka** **Trump**** over her criticism of Roy Moore, whom 
Bannon backed despite claims the candidate had sexually harassed teens. Citing an 
allegation in -legal papers from a woman (who later dropped her lawsuit) that **Donald 
**Trump**** and ****Epstein**** had raped her when she was 13, Bannon said in response to **ivanka**, 
"What about the allegations about her dad and that **13-year-old**?" 
****Epstein**** has previously used his millions to cultivate the world's most powerful — but has 
mostly given money to Democrats. 
From 2001 to 2003, Bill Clinton flew on ****Epstein****'s private plane, dubbed "The Lolita 
Express," 26 times. ****Epstein**** is close to Prince Andrew and was a regular at **Trump**'s Mar-
a-Lago. 
**Trump** told **New York** magazine of ****Epstein**** in **2002**, "Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be 
with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are 
on the younger side." 
****Epstein****, 65, pleaded guilty in **2008** to soliciting prostitution from a teen and served 13 
months in jail. 
**last year**, he reportedly paid millions to settle three lawsuits filed against him by teens. 
Bannon's rep didn't comment. A lawyer for ****Epstein**** said, "Let me ask him," but didn't 
respond by deadline.
