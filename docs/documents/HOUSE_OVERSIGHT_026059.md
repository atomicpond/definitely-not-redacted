Subject: Re: Edmond de Rothschild Infrastructure Expertise 
Importance: High 
I agree with your analysis. 
On the debt side the yield will be low for sure. Nevertheless by leading the consortium and by being the Equity 
provider of the **PPP** than the double digit return will be possible 
Happy to discuss further

**Dear Jeff**, 
As previously discussed between you and Ariane, Edmond de Rothschild is deeply involved in the building and 
financing of the infrastructure in Europe. Edmond de Rothschild has an outstanding track record, history and 
presence in European infrastructure, as well as being one of Europe's most recognized financial advisors to 
the infrastructure market. We have developed deep expertise in the infrastructure sector and sought secure, 
well-managed assets, generating stable, long-term returns for investors. 
We have done so by initiating and backing two experienced and highly-respected managers in the industry, 
TIIC and BRIDGE. TIIC is an equity investor in transport and social infrastructure. BRIDGE is an infrastructure 
debt provider. Both managers are covered in more detail below. Edmond de Rothschild has been heavily 
involved in the launch of the below funds, providing crucial support in fund structuring, due diligence, capital 
raising, legal & compliance functions as well as the sound governance and **ESG** management across all funds. 
Partnering with TIIC and BRIDGE has enabled Edmond de Rothschild to build a strong franchise within 
infrastructure investments, complementing its overall Private Equity offering. Edmond de Rothschild has also 
acted as anchor investor for these funds, demonstrating its strong alignment of interest with these 
investment teams. With Ariane we strongly believe that we should absolutely find a way to collaborate 
together with you to think and initiate something to serve the future needs of the US in the infrastructure 
field. 
Please find attached further information on each manager. This would also be a chance for us to explore 
opportunities of working together in the future. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026059 
Please feel free to reach out to us if you require any further information. We look forward to hearing from 
you soon. 
TIIC 
**TIIC Group** backed by Edmond de Rothschild, is a pan-European infrastructure firm advising on mid-market 
infrastructure projects across Europe in both the transportation and social sectors. It was established in 2008 
by the 3 founding partners of **TIIC Group**, Jaime d'Almeida, Manuel Cary and Francisco Mendes, with strategic 
support from the Edmond de Rothschild Group and Brisa. 
The aim of **TIIC Group** is to bring an operational approach to infrastructure investments in Europe, drawing 
upon the extensive management and financial skills of its team members. These skills have been developed 
over **many years** at some of Europe's leading infrastructure operators and project financing firms which, 
when combined with the very specific infrastructure expertise of both the Edmond de Rothschild Group and 
Brisa, makes for a powerful and differentiated investment platform. 
**TIIC Group** operates from two offices in **Lisbon** and **Paris**, providing its team with access to relevant 
investment opportunities across key target markets in Europe as well as to leading industrial contractors, 
operators, advisors and financiers in the infrastructure industry. 
**TIIC Group** successfully raised a First Fund with €140m of commitments targeting transportation investments 
across Europe. The portfolio of the First Fund comprises 6 assets located in **Portugal**, **Spain**, **France** and 
**Poland**. They represent a carefully balanced mix of greenfield and early stage brownfield projects in roads 
and car parks. **TIIC Group** has played an active role in the sourcing and development of all investments and 
has made a significant contribution to value creation. **TIIC Group** believes that this is a high quality, 
operationally secure, cash yielding portfolio of assets which will be of strong interest to potential investors 
over **the coming few years**. 
TIIC has launched a successor fund, TIIC 2, which will build upon **TIIC Group**' differentiated approach to 
infrastructure in Europe. TIIC 2 will is targeting aggregate commitments from investors of €300m (€350m 
hard cap) to invest into both transportation and social infrastructure projects in Europe. TIIC 2 will also seek 
to invest, on a very selective basis, into greenfield social infrastructure projects in New Frontier Markets, 
within close proximity to the Eu
