## Document Text

﻿How Alan Turing invented the computer, helped win World War
II and left us with one of the greatest puzzles of our time: are humans
simply computers or are we more than that? Many scientists think we
have a tenuous hold on the title, “most intelligent being on the planet”.
They think it’s just a matter of time before computers become smarter
than us, and then what? This book charts a journey through the science
of information, from the origins of language and logic, to the frontiers of
modern physics. From Lewis Carroll’s logic puzzles, through Alan Turing
and his work on Enigma and the imitation game, to John Bell’s inequality,
and finally the Conway-Kochen ‘Free Will’ Theorem. How do the laws
of physics give us our creativity, our rich experience of communication
and, especially, our free will?
Can a computer win the imitation game and pass the Turing Test?
Why do creative people make better mates than rich people?
Why are humans bad at mathematics, yet so creative?
Could an infinite number of monkeys write Hamlet?
Is our brain a quantum computer?
Is free will an illusion?
James Tagg is an inventor and entrepreneur. A pioneer of
touchscreen technology, he has founded several companies, including
Truphone, the world’s first global mobile network. He holds numerous
patents, filed in over a hundred countries. He studied Physics and
**Computer Science** at Manchester University, Design at Lancaster
University and Engineering at ****Cambridge University****. He lives with his
family on a farm in Kent, England.

“I can’t tell you when the last time was that I had this much fun
reading and using my brain. From the very beginning, James Tagg had
me hooked with the premise; the question of whether or not humans are
the most intelligent beings on the planet....”
Janet, Netgalley
“This is a fantastic book. It seams together cutting edge
neuroscience, psychology, thought experiments, artificial intelligence/
machine learning, mathematics and even some history!...”
PFJ H., Amazon
“Hard work to read, but makes you think about the nature of human
intelligence and AI...”
Brian Clegg, Popular Science
“This is a fat book that covers a huge amount of ground. James’
topic is primarily the brain and how we think, but there is a running
theme contrasting the human brain with computers. His thesis is that
computers can never think like humans (for example, that they can never
be truly creative) and he explores many fields from philosophy and logic
to mathematics in pursuit of this proof....”

I
am an inventor. I’ve always been an inventor. Ever since childhood
I’ve tinkered with electronics and computers, taking things apart
and putting them back together. There is no academic course
for inventing, so I had to choose my own path through school and
University. I studied design, physics and mathematics at secondary
school, and engineering and management at University. Part of that time
was spent in the Engineering Department of ****Cambridge University**** on a
particularly special course.
