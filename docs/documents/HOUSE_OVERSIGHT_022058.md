﻿CHAPTER 20 
Jeffrey Epstein: 1953-1969 
Jeffrey Epstein's mother, Paula, was the daughter of Max and 
Lena Stolofsky, who arrived in **the United States** as Lithua-
nian refugees. Relatives on that side of the family who remained 
in the old country would all perish in the course of Adolf Hitler's 
campaign to exterminate European Jewry. 
Epstein's father, Seymour, was a manual laborer, like his 
father before him. Seymour's parents, Julius and Bessie Epstein, 
had emigrated from Russia and landed in Brooklyn, both of them 
with eighth-grade educations. They lived in Crown Heights, 
where Julius owned a house-wrecking company. 
Before landing a job with the city, Seymour had worked with 
his father. 
They were kind people, says Epstein's childhood friend Gary 
Grossberg. Seymour was there for him at a difficult time, Gross-
berg says. When Grossberg was young, his parents divorced, and

his father moved out of Brooklyn. Seymour and Paula took Gary 
in. Often they referred to him as their third son. "Paula was a 
wonderful mother and homemaker," Grossberg remembers, 
"despite the fact that she had a full-time job." 
Epstein, as a kid, was "chubby, with curly hair and a high, 
`hee-hee' kind of laugh," Beverly Donatelli recalls.* Beverly was 
two years older than Epstein, but thanks to his precocious tal-
ents, which allowed him to skip two grades, they graduated from 
Brooklyn's ****Lafayette High School**** together, in 1969. 
"He was advanced," Beverly remembers. "He tutored my girl-
friend and myself in the summer. He taught me geometry in just 
two months." 
When Beverly thinks of Epstein now, she recalls gentler times—
long strolls down the Coney Island boardwalk, roller-coaster rides, 
stolen kisses. "That last year in school, I think he kind of loved me," 
she says. "One night on the beach he kissed me. In fact, our history 
teacher made up a mock wedding invitation for Jeffrey and myself 
to show to the class. That seems pretty inappropriate now. But back

then, we all thought it was funny. Jews and the Italians, that was 
pretty much who went to ****Lafayette High School****. They didn't social-
ize that much. And though my mother was crazy about him, she 
told me Jewish boys don't marry Italians." 
Through the haze of **several decades**, Beverly remembers 
Epstein as a kindhearted boy and something of a prodigy—a 
gifted young pianist as well as a math whiz. 
"I was talking to my girlfriends the other day," she says.

Beverly lost contact with Epstein over the years. But not long 
after Epstein's fiftieth birthday, she got a call out of the blue. 
"He had a photo of us on the beach," she says. "A friend 
noticed it at his birthday party. And Jeffrey said to the friend: 'I 
bet she has a big ass now.' So Jeffrey called me and invited me to 
his home on 71st Street. We hung out. We reminisced. He was 
the same Jeffrey. A gentleman." 
The two never did speak again, but to this day Beverly sym-
pathizes with her high school sweetheart. 
"I feel so bad for him," Beverly says. "That's how much I 
liked him." 
Gary Grossberg was a year younger than Epstein and in the same 
class as Epstein's kid brother, Mark, with whom Grossberg 
remains very friendly, though he hasn't seen or spoken with Jef-
frey in some time. Both brothers are good people, he says.
