Subject: 
In taking his case to **Washington**, Mr. Aliyev has variously sought safe passage to **the **United States****, help in 
recovering $2 billion that relatives claimed they lost from seized businesses, or at least the satisfaction of 
embarrassing Mr. Nazarbayev. For his part, the Kazakh leader wants to make sure that the Americans stay out 
of the dispute, and not allow it to affect their alliance with his government. 
The Obama administration has done just that. Through comments in secret diplomatic cables, the former 
ambassador to **Kazakhstan** made clear his wariness of being drawn in. 
"Both sides — the government and Aliyev — seek to manipulate us to their own advantage," Richard E. 
Hoagland, who ended his term as **United States** ambassador **early this year**, wrote in **February 2009** in one of 
more than a dozen **State Department** cables obtained by the antisecrecy group **WikiLeaks** that mentioned the 
dispute. [*] 
Mr. Nazarbayev, 70, [*]a former steel worker and Soviet-era **Communist Party** leader, has been in power for 
**two decades**, presiding over Central Asia's most vibrant economy. Human rights activists, however, have 
long accused him of persecuting dissidents and political opponents. 
Mr. Aliyev, 48, [*]has served as chief of the tax police, deputy foreign affairs minister and head of the 
Kazakh equivalent of the K.G.B. But critics say he used his clout to secretly take over private companies for 
financial gain, often by threatening violence. 
Now hiding somewhere in **Europe**, he has been convicted back home on what he claims are trumped-up 
criminal charges, including a coup attempt. His wife divorced him in **June 2007**, and the Kazakh government 
has taken businesses owned by him and members of his extended family. [*] 
No longer powerful at home, Mr. Aliyev turned to **Washington**, knowing that his former father-in-law cared 
greatly about his reputation there. 
Early in **2008** he hired RJI Government Strategies, a small **Washington** lobbying group whos 
e consultants 
included Tanya Rahall, sister of Representative Nick J. Rahall II, a **West Virginia** Democrat; and a friend of 
Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of **California**. Both congressmen were booked on a trip to **Kazakhstan** 
to discuss energy policy with Mr. Nazarbayev. 
Before their departure, members of___________________________to urge him to express strong concerns about the 
harm done to a relative of Mr. Aliyev named Devincci Hourani, whose oil-company assets in **Kazakhstan** 
were seized, according to a letter to Mr. Issa from RJI. 
Mr. Issa, who had developed a rapport with the Kazakh president on an earlier visit, nonetheless agreed to 
take up the plight of Mr. Hourani. Though he stepped into the fight, he still maintained a close connection to 
the president, nominating him that summer for the Nobel Prize, a move that drew ridicule from human rights 
activists. [that's right, of Vista, CA] [*] 
Ms. Rahall worked on behalf of Mr. Aliyev and later for Mr. Hourani through **2010**, contacting the offices of 
at least two dozen members of **Congress**. They included Representative Howard L. Berman, Democrat of 
**California**, then chairman of the **HOUSE** Foreign Affairs Committee, whose office said he discussed the dispute 
with **the **State Department****. 
Ms. Rahall also pursued a second strategy. "The alternative is to embarrass the existing regime," she wrote in 
a **July **2008**** e-mail to her boss. 
She pressed **HOUSE** members to criticize the Kazakh government's human rights record. At her request, a
