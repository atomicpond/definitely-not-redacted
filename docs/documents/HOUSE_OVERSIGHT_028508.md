Satellites: Space: the next startup frontier 
The Economist 
AROUND 1,000 operational satellites are circling the **Earth**, some of them the size and weight of a large car. In the past 
year they have been joined by junior offspring: 100 or so small satellites, some of them made up of one or more 10cm 
(4-inch) cubes. They may be tiny, but each is vastly more capable than Sputnik, the first man-made satellite launched 
by **Russia** in 1957. And many more are coming. 
Space hardware used to cost so much that it was available only to generals, multinationals and the most privileged 
scientists. No more. Many of these nanosats, as small satellites weighing no more than a few kilograms are called, 
have been launched for small companies, startups and university departments, sometimes with finance raised on 
crowdfunding websites. Their construction costs can be down in the tens of thousands of dollars, which makes them 
thousands of times cheaper than **today**'s big satellites. Admittedly, there is much they cannot do, but with that sort of 
price differential, and some ingenious use of the abilities they do have, they could be surprisingly competitive players on 
a number of fronts. In **the next five **years**** another 1,000 nanosats are expected to be launched. 
Two trends are setting up nanosats for further success. Like people working on everything from robots to 3D printers, 
nanosat builders are harvesting the benefits of ever better, ever cheaper components built for smartphones and other 
consumer electronics. Some nanosats even contain complete smartphones, making use of the clever operating 
systems, radios and cameras which phones now contain. For as long as phones go on getting cheaper and more 
capable, so will nanosats. The cheapest so far—a tiny chipsat—was assembled for just $25, though it has yet to be 
successfully launched. 
The launch systems too are getting much cheaper. **SpaceX**, the innovative rocket-maker founded by **Elon Musk**, has 
already brought down the costs of getting into space; it and its competitors could reduce them a lot further. The biggest 
beneficiaries will at first be people who make big satellites. But more big satellites will mean more opportunities for 
small satellites to piggy-back on their launches. And some companies are looking at cheap little launch systems tailored 
specifically to the needs of the nanosatellite. One reason space engineers are notoriously conservative is that the costs 
of failure are high. As making and launching satellites gets cheaper, it will be ever easier for innovative, risk-taking 
nanosat-makers to orbit around the lumbering incumbents. 
Size does impose limits. Nanosats cannot peer as closely at the **Earth** or carry out as many experiments as big 
satellites. But for some jobs that does not matter. The plans that companies already have include using nanosats for 
monitoring crops, studying the sun and tracking ships and aircraft. Such a system might have been able to track 
Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, which went missing in **March**. 
Nano can do 
Yet not everyone is thrilled. One worry is that constellations of nanosats will mean a big increase in space junk; but, 
operating in low-**Earth** orbit, they burn up on re-entry after a year or so. And being cheap, they can soon be replaced 
with newer models. A more serious concern is that they are a "dual-use" technology: they could be used for military 
purposes. In **America** this has led to onerous restrictions. 
****Barack Obama**'s** administration has sensibly repealed a law of 1999 that required all satellites to be licensed by the 
State Department as munitions under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). This could mean that most 
commercial satellites will be removed from ITAR by **the end of the year** and their export administered by the Commerce 
Department. But some satellite systems and spacecraft—including anything that can carry people into space—will 
remain under ITAR. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 028508 
Care needs to be taken with military kit, but **America**'s regulations still seem excessive. A regular review to distinguish 
between systems that pose a real threat and ones that don't would be a help, as would better intelligence. Tight 
restrictions on new technologies will not work, and will damage **America**'s interests: exciting new ventures like nanosats 
will simply move to countries from which they can be launched with greater ease.

Nanosatellites: Nanosats are go! 
The Economist 
ALTHOUGH widely used, satellites are expensive to build and to launch. That began to change **last year**. On November 
19th Orbital Sciences, an American company, launched a rocket from the W
