Jeffrey - Neal 
Neither of you requires introduction. I've known Jeffrey **28 years** and this isn't a joke - 
Donald Trump introduced us. I first met Neal in 16 years ago when Bob Pine introduced 
us ... 
Neal will be visiting **NYC** **end of month**. 
I think you would both enjoy spending time together - 
Thanks to you both for always supporting me. 
You are both copied. 
**Melanie**
