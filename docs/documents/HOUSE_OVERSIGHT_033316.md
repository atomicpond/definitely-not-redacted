Transcript: Phone call between President 
Trump and journalist ****Bob** Woodward** 
Aaron Blake 
**President Trump** and ****Bob** Woodward** discuss Woodward's new book, "Fear," before its 
publication. (**the Washington **Post****) 
****Bob** Woodward**, an associate editor at **the Washington **Post****, sought an interview with 
**President Trump** as he was writing "Fear," a book about Trump's presidency. Trump 
called Woodward in early August, after the manuscript had been completed, to say he 
wanted to participate. 
Over the course of 11-plus minutes, Trump repeatedly claimed his ****White House**** staff 
hadn't informed him of Woodward's interview request — despite also admitting Sen. 
Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) had told him Woodward wanted to talk. He also started the 
phone call by saying Woodward had "always been fair" to him, but by the end he said 
the book would be "inaccurate." 
This is a transcript of that call, with key sections highlighted and annotated. To see an 
annotation, click on the yellow, highlighted text. 
Trump: Hello, **Bob**. 
BW: **President Trump**, how are you? 
Trump: How are you? How are you doing? Okay? 
BW: Real well. I'm turning on my tape recorder, with your permission. 
Trump: Oh, that's okay. That's okay. I don't mind that at all. 
BW: I'm sorry we missed the opportunity to talk for the book. 
Trump: Well, I just spoke with Kellyanne [**Conway**] and she asked me if I got a call. I 
never got a call. I never got a message. Who did you ask about speaking to me? 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033316 
BW: Well, about six people. 
Trump: They don't tell me. 
BW: A senator. I talked to Kellyanne about it two and a half months ago. 
Trump: [1. 
BW: She came for lunch. 
Trump: Well, it's too bad. Of course, you and I had a conversation **a couple of years ago**, 
and so that I think got you there a little bit. And we had a conversation many years ago, if 
you remember, in **Trump Tower**. 
BW: Yeah, I do. 
Trump: That has to be ****20 years** ago**. And you were thinking about doing a book about me 
then, which is interesting. Who knew it would've been on this subject? Right? That was not 
in the cards at that time. 
BW: That's right. Well, I'm sorry, I... 
Trump: I still remember that. 
BW: I spent a lot of time on this, talked to lots of people. 
Trump: All right. Good. 
BW: And as you know and are living, we are at a pivot point in history. 
Trump: Right. 
BW: And I would've liked to have done that, and I maximized my effort, and somehow it 
didn't get to you, or... 
Trump: It's really too bad, because nobody told me about it, and I would've loved to have 
spoken to you. You know I'm very open to you. I think you've always been fair. We'll see 
what happens. But all I can say is the country is doing very well. We're doing better 
economically just about than at any time. We're doing better on unemployment maybe than 
ever. You know, I mean, if you look at the unemployment numbers, you've heard me say it. 
And we're doing better on unemployment than just about ever. We're having a lot of___a lot 
of companies are moving back into our country, which would've been unheard of two years 
ago. If the other administration or representatives of it had kept going, had kept___you 
know, if the other group had won, I will tell you, that you would have, I think you'd have a 
GDP of less than zero. I think we would've been going in the wrong direction. Because 
regulations are such a big part of what we've done, **Bob**. 
BW: Well, I understand that point of view. And as you know, it's also a difficult time where 
the political system and you and my business is being tested. 
Trump: Yeah. Yeah. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033317 
BW: I take it very seriously. I've done books on eight presidents, going back from **Nixon** to 
Obama. 
Trump: Right. 
BW: And I learned something about reporting, frankly, Mr. President. 
Trump: Good. 
BW: I've got to go talk to people and see them outside of **the ****White House****** and outside of 
their offices, and gained a lot of insight and documentation. And it's___you know, it's a 
tough look at the world and your administration and you. 
Trump: Right. Well, I assume that means it's going to be a negative book. But you know, 
I'm some___I'm sort of 50 percent used to that. [Laughter] That's all right. Some are good 
and some are bad. Sounds like this is going to be a bad one. 
BW: It was a chance missed, and I don't know how things work over there in terms of... 
Trump: Very well. We... 
BW: ... getting to you. 
Trump: Well, if you would call Madeleine [Westerhout] in my office ... Did you speak to 
Madeleine? 
BW: No, I didn't. But I... 
Trump: Madeleine is the key. She's the secret. Because she's the person ... 
BW: Well, I talked to Raj [S
