Topics: Is US data as good as it looks? Is Chinese data as bad as it looks? Is European data as bizarre as it looks?
What a diff’rence a day makes. Ever since the ECB giftwrapped
650 billion Euros for EU banks, the news has been
pretty good, particularly in the US. Most of the market’s
focus is on the US consumer, for the simple reason that US
households are the largest single economic force in the world
(see table). Even after deconstructing the labor report for
signs of false positives 1 , the message is clear: US job markets
are gradually getting better, and so is spending. The capital
position of US banks is in good shape 2 , so we expect access
to credit to remain easy 3 . A US GDP growth rate of 2.25% is
still below trend, but a long way from the unavoidable
recession articulated by the ECRI **last fall**. I agree with those
who think the US economy could not withstand a withdrawal
of stimulus right now, but I also do not see the Fed actively
withdrawing it. Whatever rain dance the Fed is doing to
keep inflation low, they better keep doing it.
A chart I saw on the history of jobless claims (below, left) was meant to show how good things may get. In the prior 3 business
cycles, when continuing claims fell through 2.2% of the labor force (1982, 1993, 2003), it was a great time to add risk in
portfolios. Improving claims signaled that the business cycle was picking up enough steam to be self-sustaining, and **last week**,
the US crossed through this barrier again. But as Big Bird used to say, one of these things is not like the other: the US
primary budget deficit which supports this recovery is a bigger now. So, the US economy better improve markedly in order
to pay the freight. When will this chart on the primary deficit (below, right) matter to financial markets? Only when it becomes
a binding constraint, either due to a lack of demand to finance the deficit at current yields, or due to the economic cost of closing
it. The timing is uncertain, given ****Central Bank**** purchases of **Treasury** bonds, and a **Congress** which may leave the problem for
**another day** (or generation). I lose a lot of sleep over this, but I don’t know a lot of other people that do. As discussed last
week, portfolio allocations given today’s private and public sector realities vary substantially across wealth management firms.
Ours rely on hedge funds, credit and real estate as complements to public and private equity.
In past cycles, claims were a great market signal

1 Our chief economist Michael Vaknin has analyzed the various seasonal adjustments that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses when it reports
payrolls. After adjusting for better weather, the Lehman shock and other factors, payroll growth does not look quite as good as reported, but
is still positive. The trend is supported by the latest Manpower surveys, Institute for Supply Management surveys, JOLTS surveys, etc, all of
which show growing demand for labor. Even state and local government firing has finally come to an end, which was a constant fixture of
**the last two years**. So far, hourly earnings remain very weak, and typically do not grow until later in the cycle.
2 The latest US bank stress tests were pretty stressful. **two-year** loss assumptions applied by the Fed were higher than those experienced
during 2008 and 2009, and comparable in almost every category to realized losses during the Great Depression. Almost every institution
passed the test, and even the ones that didn’t are expected to reach required capital levels in short order. US banks have sharply reduced
reliance on “hot money” (time deposits, commercial paper and repo), relying instead on core retail deposits to finance their balance sheets.
Comparing the rigor of US and European bank stress tests is like comparing the rigors of actual football to Wii football.
3 So far, net household borrowing other than student loans is weak; loan growth is almost exclusively from companies rather than households.
