fred gave him 15k as a **3 year old** only. however ( written 200k in "todays dollars" ) then they compound 
their silliness, stating that he was a millonair at **age 8**.? all silly, . if **fred put** 2k in treasuries the same 
year ,and didnt invest it it would be worth 1 million **today**. instead he invested in real estate. taxes on 
estates and gigts are taxed on the value of what was transferred not the underlying thing. ex if you own 10 
percent of a partnership interest in a 1 million builidng that cannot be sold for **20 years**. what is the value of 
your interest. not 10 percent of 1 million as you only own a ltd partnership right. maybe 2 percent. its all 
legal
