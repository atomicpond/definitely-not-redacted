Subject: National **Enquirer** Comment Request Re: Jeffrey Epstein 
Importance: High 
Tonja--
**the National **Enquirer**** is preparing to publish a story that Bill Clinton used a private "orgy" jet to travel to 
Brunei for an extraordinary dinner with a royal accused of duping American women into "white slavery." 
The **Enquirer** will report that Bill was accompanied by the 727's owner, billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, 
when he landed in the tiny South-**East Asian** country on May 25, 2002. His entourage also included two 
women who allegedly worked as "madams" for Epstein, luring teenaged girls into sex trysts with the tycoon 
and his powerful and famous friends. 
According to The **Enquirer**'s investigation, Bill spent the day playing golf at a seven-star hotel -- and then was 
invited to dine with Brunei's sultan, Hassanal Bolkiah .....who was charged with holding a deeply-religious 
Christian beauty queen as a "human chattel." Far from being embarrassed by the ruler's tawdry 
reputation, moreover, records for Bill's nonprofit foundation reveal that Brunei made a donation towards his 
Clinton Presidential Library that year of between $1. million and $5 million. 
Please kindly attempt to provide any comment by 4 pm ET tomorrow, Friday January 30th to Lachlan 
Cartwright, Executive Editor, at [Office] or 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025790 
Thank You,
