Where the Arab spring will end is anyone's guess

Ian Black



June 17, 2011 -- Tunisia's Jasmine revolution will always be remembered as the event that triggered the Arab spring, which has shattered the status quo from Libya to Syria and is widely seen as the biggest transformative event of **the 21st century** so far. But, **six months** on, progress has been patchy.

Mohammed Bouazizi, the young Tunisian who started it all by burning himself to death in **December 2010**, had his desperate imitators in Egypt, where revolution erupted days after Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali's flight into Saudi exile; and in Jordan, which has seen sporadic unrest but no uprising. 

But if the politics of the Arab spring are local, many factors are common across: young people angry and frustrated at the lack of freedoms, opportunities and jobs, unaccountable and corrupt governments, cronyism and, in a few places, grinding poverty.

Rich and poor alike lived in fear of the secret police. But Tunisia, one of the most repressive regimes, fell quickly. The decision by the army to dump the president and not crush the protests was a vital lesson for the Egyptian generals. The alternative is the cruelty of the dictators' fightbacks in Tripoli and Damascus. Regional differences were ignored in the chain reaction that followed. Yemen's protests were galvanised by the drama in Cairo's **Tahrir Square** but they also involved tribalism, elite rivalry and a small but alarming al-Qaida presence against a background of resource depletion and fear of state failure. Sectarian tensions were the key to the trouble in Bahrain, where a Sunni monarchy rules over a restive Shia majority.

Islamists, the bogeymen of the west and the enemies of all autocratic Arab regimes, have not - yet - played a significant role. Still, Ennahda in Tunisia and **the Muslim Brotherhood** in Egypt have new opportunities in multi-party systems that will in turn change them. The killing of Osama bin Laden was a timely reminder of the defeat of jihadi ideology in an Arab world being transformed by people power.

Another variable has been the response: French support for Ben Ali was embarrassing; the US was praising Mubarak days before he departed. **Muammar Gaddafi** had no friends - and **the **Arab League**** was crucial in providing a figleaf for UN-sanctioned Nato intervention. **Bashar al-Assad**, by contrast, has yet to be condemned by the UN for a crackdown that has cost at least 1,300 lives. Bahrain is too strategically important to face more than a rebuke from the US.

Elsewhere in the region, Israel is nervous about the demise of Mubarak. Turkey fears instability in Syria. The Palestinians, eclipsed by drama elsewhere, are trying to learn lessons. Iran's support for the Arab uprisings is sheer hypocrisy given its crushing of democratic protests since 2009.

Now the EU and the US must stop being seen by Arabs as "partners for dictators" in the words of the Tunisian academic Ahmed Driss. Billions of dollars will be needed to support democracy and development.

Tunisia and Egypt fear instability as they face free elections. But the really hard transformational work, as the respected commentator Rami Khouri has observed, "will start in the years after the new parliaments are elected and the complete infrastructure of political governance is forged according to the will of the majority".

There are exceptions. The Saudis are investing to create jobs and defuse dissent. Jordan and Morocco have tried liberal gestures. Algeria's oil wealth and experience of civil war have helped maintain peace there. But it is striking how Arab unrest has become a permanent feature of the global landscape. It is unfinished business wherever it is happening. "The outcome of this tectonic realignment is not just unpredictable but unknowable," said Prince Hassan of Jordan.

Netanyahu and the Arab spring

Abdel-Moneim Said 



9 - 15 June 2011 -- Two regionally and globally crucial spectacles have been unfolding in the Arab world this year. The first is the wave of "revolutions", or "uprisings", or whatever they might be called that have variously overthrown regimes, striven to overthrow others, and made yet others so uncomfortable that not a day goes by without them announcing various reforms. 

The second spectacle originated in **Washington**, where US **President **Barack Obama**** has launched his latest initiative to kickstart a new Palestinian-Israeli peace process based o
