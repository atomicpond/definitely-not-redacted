New Firepower in Shocking Suit Against
**Trump**

If you thought the presidential election couldn’t get any uglier, guess again. Because a suit against
Donald **Trump** alleging that he raped a **13-year-old** girl has new life.
**On **Monday****, **Florida** criminal defense lawyer J. Cheney Mason—best known for successfully
defending Casey Anthony, who was charged with killing her 2-year-old daughter—filed court papers
to represent “**Jane **Doe****” in a suit against **Trump** and disgraced financier **Jeffrey **Epstein****.

The rape suit isn’t exactly new. It was filed pro se by “Katie **Johnson**” in ****Los Angeles**** federal court in
**April**, dismissed, refiled in **the **Southern District**** of **New York**, withdrawn and refiled on Sept. 30. But
with the addition of Mason—a media-savvy lawyer not known for shying away from the
spotlight—the stakes have changed.
Suddenly, it’s a lot more serious. Which is not the same as legitimate, but
the odds that the case will go away quietly are much slimmer given the
firepower of her new counsel. Especially now, in the wake of a **2005**
recording where **Trump** bragged about using his star power to kiss and
grope women.
The allegations in the suit are truly awful. **Jane **Doe**** says that when she was
13, she attended parties at **Epstein**’s ****New York** City** townhouse, enticed by
promises of money and a modeling career. She allegedly had sexual
encounters with **Trump** on four occasions there.
The complaint states, “**Defendant **Trump**** tied plaintiff to a bed, exposed
himself to plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape plaintiff. During the
course of this savage sexual attack, plaintiff loudly pleaded with **Defendant **Trump**** to stop but with no
effect. **Defendant **Trump**** responded to plaintiff’s pleas by violently striking plaintiff in the face with
his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted.”
**Epstein** allegedly raped her as well. **In **2008****, he pleaded guilty to soliciting an underage girl for
prostitution, and has faced other suits by women who allege underage sexual assault.
**Trump**’s lawyer **Alan Garten**, has unequivocally denied the allegations. In fact, the current complaint
quotes his denial: “The allegations are not only categorically false, but disgusting at the highest level
and clearly framed to solicit media attention or, perhaps, are simply politically motivated. There is
absolutely no merit to these allegations. Period.” **Doe**’s suit claims that this statement is libelous.
The only reason I can think of for including such a seemingly absurd claim (how can you libel
someone who is anonymous?) is that it’s not time-barred. The rest of the complaint probably is.
The alleged incidents took place in **1994**—22 years ago. The complaint claims that **Doe** didn’t come
forward because she was “unrelentingly threatened by each defendant that, were she ever to reveal
any of the details of the sexual and physical abuse caused to her by defendants, plaintiff and her
family would be physically harmed if not killed.”
But **Epstein** **In **2008**** was sentenced to **18 months** in prison. Why couldn’t she have come forward
then?
That’s not the only problem with the case.
I wrote about the suit when it was first filed in LA with great skepticism—“an anonymous stink
bomb,” I called it.
In large part, I was dubious because the person filing the complaint, “Katie **Johnson**,” claimed her
only past work experience was as a freelance model. And yet her pro se complaint was perfectly
formatted, with proper margins and numbering; it correctly cited statutes, got the venue and
jurisdiction correct and contained no typos.

It looked more to me like the secret handiwork of a lawyer intent on smearing **Trump**.
If so, however, there was no way to hold anyone accountable. The phone number provided was
disconnected and **Johnson**’s address was an abandoned, foreclosed house.
The allegations in the latest complaint by “**Jane **Doe****” are the same, albeit with fewer lurid details and
no explanation why she is no longer Katie **Johnson**. But the biggest difference is that she’s got
lawyers now.
In addition to Mason, “**Jane **Doe****” is represented—improbably—by ****New Jersey**** patent litigator
Thomas **Meagher**, the managing partner of nine-lawyer IP boutique **Meagher** Emanuel Laks Goldberg
& Lia
