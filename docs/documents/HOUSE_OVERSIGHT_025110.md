Pardon the formality below - I want to approach your very legitimate questions / concerns in a serious 
manner. 
Attached and below the same. 
**Dear Jeffrey**: 
As requested, the following addresses your two questions / concerns about our proposed Closer To Truth TV 
series "The Science of Sleep and Dreams": 
(i) Have there been sufficient breakthroughs in Sleep and Dreams (significantly beyond traditional 
understandings) to justify a major TV series? 
(ii) Even if 'yes' to (i), is now the proper time for such a foundational series, or are more years needed for 
corroborative studies and further research to solidify the breakthroughs? 
In preparing this response, my primary source is Professor Patrick McNamara, Department of Neurology, 
**Boston University** School of Medicine, with whom **CTT** Producer/Director **Peter Getzels** and I spoke with at 
length today. Patrick is one of the leading sleep and dream researchers (he himself more dreams). More 
importantly, he is perhaps the leading chronicler of the field, with many publications (including 26 entries in 
related encyclopedias). He is co-editor-in-chief of the "Encyclopedia of Sleep and Dreams" (**2012**) and 
the sole author of the forthcoming "An Introduction to the Neuroscience of Sleep and Dreams" (**Cambridge** 
**University Press**, **2018**), which intends to present the latest science and to become a main textbook for 
graduate courses/seminars. Patrick is a **CTT** contributor and colleague. 
When we asked Patrick, his first response — "This is the ideal time to tell the sleep-and-dreams story" — and 
he cited (in essence) your two questions, in that (i) the multiple breakthroughs are now sufficiently well 
corroborated by numerous independent labs such that a substantial foundation for the new, deeper 
understanding of sleep and dreams is now for the first time (over **the past few years**) confirmed and 
established, and (ii) there are now interesting application and critical clinical questions to pose, explore and 
pursue, such as for the treatment of various mental-related illnesses that have known sleep-related syndromes 
(e.g., PTSD and Depression). 
To understand the significance of recent breakthroughs, a defining characteristic of sleep and dreams is that 
there are two distinct kinds of sleep — REM (rapid-eye-movement) Sleep and NREM (non-rapid-eye-
movement) Sleep. Most dreams are associated with REM sleep (though complex). The eye movement 
gives the eponymous name, but a more important designation defines the two stages in terms of brain waves 
(electroencephalograph — EEG): REM is Fast-Wave Sleep (similar to the waking state) and NREM Sleep is 
Slow-Wave Sleep (very different from the waking state). This difference between REM and NREM sleep 
has been known since **1953** (different EEGs since **1937**), but its deep significance has only been discovered 
and confirmed in very **recent years** (as explained below). 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025111 
Following are the key areas of breakthrough in sleep and dreams (from Patrick). Patrick states that these are 
now reproducible, non-controversial, and well-accepted among experts, although still not appreciated by the 
public - hence the high value of our **CTT** TV series. The organizing idea is why and how are sleep and 
dreams essential for normal memory consolidation and bodily health / well-being.
