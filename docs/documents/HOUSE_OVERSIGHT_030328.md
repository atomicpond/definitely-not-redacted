I read what his ghost-writer said about him. Pretty scary. 
Reminds me of something I was told by Jon Snow, one of **England**'s most sensible newsmen. He was with the 
press entourage accompanying **Tony Blair** on his visit to **Saudi Arabia**, and walking around one of the palaces 
**one day**, he saw Blair sitting in a room with a book in his lap, which greatly surprised him -- until he came over 
to talk. It was the New Testament. 
And then Blair started telling about how delighted he and Cheri were with the gold door handles,.... 
I notice that your prediction was right about **Trump**'s avoiding **the White **HOUSE**** as far too primitive. Must be 
driving **the Secret Service** up the wall. 
I'll keep in mind what you say about **Trump**'s tweets, but they are hard to ignore. Whatever he may think, 
others here and abroad can't help considering the meaning of the words, and take action accordingly. 
About meaning, It's not clear to me how to distinguish the meaning of "**New York**" (however it is correctly 
specified) from the concept. Still don't see how to work out field models.

For word meanings, the closest I can think of to something like this is an array of meaning postulates, in 
Carnap's sense, something that Jerry Fodor for one has toyed with. Multidimensional, but not a field. I don't 
see how to work it out, or to extend it to the interpretations of longer units.

happy chanukah. . - has anyone in the past made a linguistic model that used fields instead of 
definitions, similar to a magnet field. to some degree. there is no one vector that describes the word but 
a field of them. home surrounded by a field of definitions. not based on 3 d space but based on context 
. one could integrate over the field. see smoothness. strength, change. . not sure it is useful. but
