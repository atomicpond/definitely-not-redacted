PARTIES
1. Plaintiff is an individual residing in and a citizen of the State of **California**.
2. Upon information and belief, Defendants **DONALD J. **Trump**** and **Jeffrey E. **Epstein****
each reside in this District and are citizens of **the State of **New York****.

under 28 U.S.C. § 1332.
4. Defendants are citizens of **the State of **New York**** for purposes of diversity
jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332.
Case 1:16-cv-04642 Document 1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 2 of 9
5. This **Court** has original subject matter jurisdiction with respect to this action
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332 as there exists complete diversity of citizenship between Plaintiff
and Defendants and the amount in controversy exceeds Seventy Five Thousand Dollars
($75,000.00), exclusive of interest and costs.
6. Defendants are each subject to the jurisdiction of this **Court** pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
§ 1332 with proper venue pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 as both defendants are residents of
and/or are domiciled in this district and the events giving rise to the claims occurred in this

RAPE, SEXUAL MISCONDUCT, CRIMINAL SEXUAL ACTS, SEXUAL ABUSE,
FORCIBLE TOUCHING, ASSAULT, BATTERY, INTENTIONAL AND RECKLESS
INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, DURESS, AND FALSE
IMPRISONMENT
7. Plaintiff was subject to acts of rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts,
sexual abuse, forcible touching, assault, battery, intentional and reckless infliction of emotional
distress, duress, false imprisonment, and threats of death and/or serious bodily injury by the
Defendants that took place at several parties during the summer months of **1994**. The parties
were held by Defendant **Epstein** at a ****New York** City** residence that was being used by Defendant
**Epstein** at 9 E. 71st St. in **Manhattan**. During this period, Plaintiff was a minor of age 13 and
was legally incapable under **New York** law of consenting to sexual intercourse and the other
sexual contacts detailed herein. NY Penal L § 130.05(3)(a). The rapes in the first, second, and
third degrees; sexual misconduct; criminal sexual acts in the first, second, and third degrees;
sexual abuse in the first, second, and third degrees; and forcible touching (and, on information
2
Case 1:16-cv-04642 Document 1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 3 of 9
and belief, predatory sexual assault) detailed herein are unlawful under **New York** law, e.g., NY
Penal L § 130.20-130.52, and 130.55-130.65 (and, on information and belief, 130.95) and
constitute the torts of, inter alia, assault, battery, false imprisonment, and intentional or reckless
infliction of emotional distress, including threats of force and serious bodily harm, under **New
York** law. Declaration of Plaintiff **Jane Doe**, Exhibit A hereto; Declaration of **Tiffany Doe**,
Exhibit B hereto. **Jane Doe** and **Tiffany Doe** are each pseudonyms as each woman wishes
anonymity. **Tiffany Doe**, a witness, was an employee of Defendant **Epstein**. Exh. B.
8. Courts have discretion to allow proceeding anonymously where the need for
privacy outweighs the public’s interest in knowing their identity and any prejudice to the
defendants. Sealed Plaintiff v. Sealed Defendant, 537 F.3d 185, 189 (2d Cir. **2008**). This
litigation involves matters that are highly sensitive and of a personal nature, and identification of
Plaintiff would pose a risk of retaliatory physical harm to her and to others. Exh. A. All of the
ten factors that **the Second Circuit** articulated as relevant to this analysis favor anonymity,
especially factors 1-4, 7, and 10 (e.g., factors one and two: “whether the litigation involves
matters that are ‘highly sensitive and [of a] personal nature,’” and “’whether identification poses
a risk of retaliatory physical or mental harm to the ... party [seeking to proceed anonymously] or
even more critically, to innocent non-parties’”.), or are neutral with respect to anonymity.
Protecting Plaintiff’s anonymity is also appropriate as she is a rape victim.
9. Plaintiff was enticed by promises of money and a modeling career to attend a
series of parties, with other similarly situated minor females, held at a ****New York** City** residenc
