Given the risk of further restrictive trade measures, we answer investors' top questions. We expect 
shares to remain choppy, with a near-term floor around $160. Our estimates are unchanged but 
peer multiple contraction drives our SoTP-driven PT to $231 (from $240). 
What is the latest view on **iPhone** demand in **China**? On **Apple**'s **April** 30th earnings call, CEO Tim 
Cook noted that the November-December period was likely to be the trough in **iPhone** demand in 
**China**, following an improvement in performance during the **March** quarter helped by **iPhone** price 
cuts, **VAT** tax rollbacks, increased financing options and better consumer confidence. Data from 
push-messaging service provider Jigaung shows that the improvement in **iPhone** demand likely 
persisted through **April**, where **Apple** gained over 175bps of Chinese smartphone installed base 
share Y/Y (1). However, the increasingly tough trade rhetoric and actions recently taken by US and 
Chinese authorities make it less likely this trend will continue into May/June. Late last week, 
following the **Huawei** blacklist, **President Trump** commented that "it's possible that **Huawei** would be 
________included in a trade deal", suggesting recent actions could be bargaining chips to use in trade 
negotiations that can be worked out by/around the G20 Summit in **late June**, but with **Apple** guiding 
June quarter revenue down 8% Q/Q (vs. trailing 3 year seasonality of -14% Q/Q), the risk remains 
that weaker near-term demand in **China** increases the risk of a revenue shortfall. For reference, we 
model 37M **iPhone** shipments in the June quarter (-10% Y/Y), in-line with **iPhone** builds, which 
implies a 5th consecutive quarter of double digit **iPhone** shipment declines in **China**. If we assume 
Chinese demand significantly weakens in the last 6 weeks of the quarter and **iPhone** shipments 
instead fall 50% Y/Y (a 10 point further deceleration from **March** Q declines), then we'd expect 2.3M 
lower **iPhone** units (-6% vs. our current model), $1.6B lower revenue (-2.9%) and a $0.05 hit to EPS 
(-2
