Hi Jeffrey, 
Sorry for the phone tag. In case it's easier to respond by email, I have put my questions below. I'm at my desk and should be 
here until 5, and should be free on my cell phone after 6:30. 
Best, 
Alex

-what is the square footage of your Manhattan home? 
-do you work on a laptop from your dining room, with a large white board for notes and several pairs of reading glasses close at 
hand? Is the dining room windowless? 
-do paparazzi often camp outside your home? 
-did Michael once visit on **the same day** as a head of state who'd had a police escort? 
-did you tell Michael about a dinner you'd hosted for six tech entrepreneurs who had a combined worth of several hundred 
billion dollars? When was this meal? 
-Do you believe that there are now more people who possess Roosevelt or Carnegie-levels of wealth, the sort that can rival 
governments in influence? That these people face unusual challenges when entering philanthropy due to the sheer size of 
their fortunes? That the rich may know the business that made them rich, but not money itself? 
-are you interested in what will happen to the $4.2 trillion possessed by the super-rich in 40-odd years once they have mostly 
died? 
-Do you believe no superrich people want to give their entire fortunes to their children for fear of how it might affect them? 
-do you advise the **Bill and ****Melinda **Gates Foundation******** on how to convince other billionaires to join their initiatives? 
-did you volunteer to invest $20 million dollars in Michael's attempt to buy ****New York Magazine**** in 2004? 
-do you believe the recent claims about Alan Dershowitz and Prince Andrew in relation to you are "ludicrous" ? 
-When you met Michael for lunch in **the **West Village****, was it the first time in 10 years you'd gone to lunch at a restaurant? 
-Do you have a support staff of young women in their **20s and 30s**? Have some of them worked for you for many years, through 
their own marriages and as they raise families? Have any of these employees been romantically involved with you? When 
Michael came to your home, had one of these women recently gone on an around the world honeymoon, which you 
arranged? Do they often travel with you to your other homes — in **New Mexico**, Paris, Palm Beach, and in the Caribbean? Do 
you maintain there is no quid-pro-quo in the relationships with these women? Do these women often socialize with the policy 
makers and businessmen with whom you often meet? 
-Is your current girlfriend a dental student you met **four years ago** at a dinner party in New York? 
-Did you date Eva Andersson Dubin? Have you known her for 30 years? Did you pay for her to go to medical school? 
-when you take meetings in your Manhattan dining room, do you take your guests out to a Sabrett hot dog cart? Will the 
women who work for you accompany you? 
-Did you invite Michael to sit in on a presentation by a group of quants? Are you looking for a group of quants who have 
developed promising investing algorithms, and do you plan to invest $5 million with each? 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026351 
-during U.N. Week in **late September**, did you host a Sunday night discussion with Bill Gates, **Mort Zuckerman**, and **Peter Thiel**? 
Was anyone else in attendance? Were you discussing a possible **Gates Foundation** donor advised fund? 
-Did you host Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim and several others from Qatar? Do you know if the Sheikh has a home across the street 
from you in Manhattan? Did they talk to you about bribery compromising their bid for the World Cup? When was this? Did 
they bring a gift of chocolate made with pistachios grown on the Sheikh's farm? 
-The morning after the Qataris came over, did you have a 9 AM breakfast with the attorney **Reid Weingarten**? Did you discuss 
his defense of CT governor John Rowland, the Qatari visit, and who controls ISIS? Did Weingarten believe Turkey was using ISIS 
as a proxy against the Kurds? 
-After this, did you meet with **Brock Pierce** to discuss bitcoin? Did Larry Summers join this meeting? 
-That evening, did you host Australian PM Kevin Rudd and Thorborn Jagland for a cocktail party? Did Jagland critique US 
foreign policy? Did you offer to fly him back to Europe on your jet? 
-The following morning, did **Ehud Barack** come over for breakfast? Did he have an omelet? Did he defend both Putin and 
Obama? 
-Was this followed by a senior ****White House**** official, whose name you don't want mentioned? 
-Did you then meet with Elisa New to discuss supporting a poetry series and other sources of funding? Did you forcefully 
critique her proposed budget? 
-After meeting with Ne
