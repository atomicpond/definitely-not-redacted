HOUSE OVERSIGHT 022696 
Carlo Allegri / Reuters 
Over roughly **the past month**, coverage of Bill Clinton's travels with financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have made 
their way from a thick stack of court documents into something approaching political mythology, propelled by a string of 
innuendo-laced reports hinting that the former president must have been in some way complicit when he voyaged with a 
billionaire known for preying on underage girls. 
It's a story with plenty to gape at, from horrific and excruciatingly detailed allegations against Epstein to the frequent presence of 
a former president who was, after all, nearly chased from office for a (consensual) affair with an intern. 
But sometimes stories that seem too good to be true —just might be. A detailed review by a team of **BuzzFeed News** reporters of 
more than 2,000 pages of pleadings, depositions, affidavits, police reports, flight logs, and other documents filed in state and 
federal court found that many of the most provocative allegations about Clinton have little to no factual foundation and are 
exaggerated at best; that the documents — which appear to be the source for nearly all current reporting on this subject — 
themselves never suggest that Clinton was doing more than using his wealthy friend as a kind of global taxi service; and that 
many of the most lurid insinuations have been floated without any visible support from verifiable information. 
While it's still possible that some Rosetta stone of Clintonian depravity will surface from a pair of ongoing lawsuits involving 
Epstein, the fact that nothing even close to that has been dug up over the course of a half-dozen years of heated litigation should 
not be encouraging for Republican operatives and other Clinton critics hotly anticipating the very worst. 
One sign that the connection is a bit weak: The lawyers who have used the Clinton link to help publicize their cases have been 
markedly vague on details. 
When asked to present actual proof, **Jack Scarola**, the Florida attorney responsible for filing some of the most attention-grabbing 
documents that have come to light in **recent weeks**, warned darkly in an email of "extortionate threats, power, wealth or political 
pressure." 
"The time will come when all your questions will be answered," said Scarola, who represents another trial attorney suing Epstein in 
**Palm Beach** County Court. "But that time is not now." 
Unwilling to wait, perhaps, publications on both sides of the **Atlantic** have gleefully dipped into those documents to publish 
of Epstein's "black book," which contains a host of Clinton phone numbers (along with just about every 
other powerful figure in the Western world); dissections of handwritten flight logs for the financier's private 727 aircraft that 
frequently capture Bubba at 30,000 feet; and extensive allegations from a woman, Virginia Roberts, who claims she was Epstein's 
sex slave as a teenager and whose recollection places the former commander-in-chief on "Orgy Island" in 2002 to participate in a 
sexual romp, possibly with women who were not yet of age.

Tellingly, many of those articles — which have notably increased in tempo in **recent weeks** following Roberts' **late December** 
accusation that noted attorney Alan Dershowitz was one of the men she was forced to have sex with — contain language 
underscoring the fact that none of this proves anything. "It should at this stage be stressed that the Mail has no evidence to 
corroborate this and other claims made by Virginia Roberts," the Daily Mailwrote in April. "Though her LinkedIn page claims a 
certificate in Swedish massage, there is no evidence that she ever
