## Document Text

```
From: **Michael Wolff** 
Sent: 7/12/2018 7:55:54 AM 
To: **Jeffrey Epstein** [jeeyacation@gmail.com] 
Subject: A few thoughts 
Importance: High 
1) I saw SB in **London** **yesterday** and he seemed especially paranoid about any reporters seeing me with him. 
My guess is that he is working hard on his relationship with **Trump** who he sees as newly ascendent and being 
seen with me might queer that. 
2) He went on **hannity** last night and will be on Piers Morgan **tomorrow** and that seemed with an eye toward an 
audience of one. 
3) He was having a meeting **yesterday** with the French right wingers, including Le Pen's husband, about 
refinancing the National Front Party because apparently a good part of their money comes from **Russia**. Two 
thoughts here, these guys seemed like idiots, pure Ruritania, and Bannon, surrounded by his own thuggish-
looking security people and whacky-bloggers advisors, thrives precisely because the world of populism is so 
unprofessional (if not farcical). 
more later...
