Subject: this is the type of crazy frank rich nytimes that screams be careful 
From: **Jeffrey Epstein** <jeevacation©gmail.com> 
To: **Jes Staley** < >; PETER MANDELSON 
**Kennedy** didn't settle for the generic populist rhetoric of Obama's latest threats to "fight" unspecified bankers 
some indeterminate day. He instead took the strong action of dressing down U.S. Steel by name. As Richard 
Reeves writes in his book "President **Kennedy**," reporters were left "literally gasping." The young president 
called out big steel for threatening "economic recovery and stability" while Americans risked their lives in 
**Southeast Asia**. J.F.K. threatened to sic his brother's **Justice Department** on corporate records and then held 
firm as his opponents likened his flex of muscle to the power grabs of **Hitler** and Mussolini. (Sound familiar?) 
U.S. Steel capitulated in **two days**. The **Times** soon reported on its front page that **Kennedy** was at "a high point 
in popular support."
