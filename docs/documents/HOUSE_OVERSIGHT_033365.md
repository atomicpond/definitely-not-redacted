﻿**5/29/2019** Opinion | Trump Hands **China** an Easy Win in the Trade War - **The New** **York **Times****
Trump Hands **China** an Easy
Win in the Trade War
The presidentʼs tough rhetoric plays into Chinese economic
nationalism.
By Kevin **Rudd**
Mr. **Rudd**, a former prime minister of **Australia**, is the president of the Asia Society Policy
Institute.
**May 29, 2019**
When President Trump tweeted on **May 5** that the **China** trade deal was off, the historical echoes
in **Beijing** were loud and clear. Almost exactly 100 years earlier, **China**’s “May Fourth Movement”
of **1919** was a direct response to the actions of President Woodrow Wilson at the end of **World War**
I. Wilson had promised **China**, an American ally, that German colonies in Shandong would be
returned to Chinese sovereignty, but instead handed them to **Japan**. **China** exploded with anti-
American, nationalist sentiment. One of the eventual consequences was the establishment of the
Chinese **Communist Party**, which for the last 70 years has ruled the country.
Thus, Mr. Trump has handed **XI Jinping** a remarkably effective nationalist card to play at a time
when he has been under pressure at home because of a slowing economy. The Chinese media is
now full of accounts of the country’s economic resilience and appeals to patriotism, even invoking
the spirit of the Korean War, when, according to the official narrative, **China** was able to stare
down the vastly superior American military.
And just in case people didn’t get the point, Mr. Xi recently visited Jiangxi, the starting point of
the Long March in **1934**, in which **the **Communist Party**** endured many hardships but ultimately
emerged victorious.
I can almost hear members of the Trump administration groaning. Why on earth would they need
to take into consideration events in **China**’s ancient past?
The answer depends on what Mr. Trump’s primary objective is. If it’s to sound tough to American
voters, he may well have a winning formula. But if it’s to bring about a substantive change in
**China**’s negotiating posture toward a bilateral trade agreement, one that might usher in changes
in **China**’s trade policy, addressing questions of forced technology transfers, intellectual property
theft, industrial subsidies, currency manipulation and a phalanx of other non-tariff barriers, I’m
not so sure.

**5/29/2019** Opinion | Trump Hands **China** an Easy Win in the Trade War - **The New** **York **Times****
Days after the president’s tweets, **China** listed three “red lines,” positions **the United States** had
taken in the trade talks that were unacceptable: First, that it would keep tariffs in place for a
period after the proposed trade agreement was signed. Second, that it could impose punitive
tariffs if it judged **China** to be in violation of the agreement, and that **China** would be forbidden
from retaliating with its own tariffs. Third, the ever-inflating expectations of the terms under
which **Beijing** would buy American goods under a proposed bilateral purchasing agreement.
These “red lines” were new. Before that, **China**’s negotiating team had a fully flexible remit from
the leadership. But not anymore. Now that these three lines are in the public domain, there is no
way Chinese leaders can yield on them. The leaks of large parts of the negotiating text to the
American news media has added a new level of toxicity, making it virtually impossible to return
to the existing text as a basis of negotiations. Together with recent moves against the Chinese
telecom company **Huawei** presumably intended to pressure **Beijing** further, the possibility of
negotiating a revised agreement that is more accommodating to American interests is now very
slim.
Instead, what I have seen in **Beijing** over the last few weeks is a country moving in exactly the
opposite direction.

Donald Trumpʼs Great Patriotic Wars May 26, 2019
Economic analysts, meanwhile, have been calculating the impact of a full-blown trade war,
estimating a loss of about 1.2 percentage points to Chinese G.D.P. growth. This figure is now
portrayed in the Chinese media as entirely manageable given **China**’s capacity to use fiscal and
monetary policy stimulus to support domestic demand and keep growth above 6 percent.
Even if a trade deal with **the United States** is still possible, some in the Chinese leadership are
now starting to ask, why bother? They argue that in technology, investment, foreign policy,
national security and human rights, the Trump administration has made it clear that it has
embarked on a more adversarial position toward **China**. So why should **Beijing** expend any more
political capital on a trade deal? Perhaps it’s better, in **China**’s view, to cut its losses now and get
ready for the next **Cold War**.
