## Document Text

```
From: **Robert Trivers** 
Sent: 4/20/2017 3:54:45 PM 
To: ****Jeffrey** Epstein** [jeevacation@gmail.com] 
Subject: good and bad 
Importance: High 
**Jeffrey** 
in a mixed state 
on the up side i now have an excellent agent, am adding two chapters to my expanded memoir that deal with 1. 
my first five famous papers and 2. my work on genetic conflict within ourselves; so there is a good chance i can 
sell the book by **this summer** to a publisher and start reaping some money off it 
a friend at **Cornell** has now contacted me regarding a special senior fellowship they have and i remain hopeful 
that i will soon be relaxing with the famously beautiful women of Aarhus by **late September** 
on the downside, **Jamaica** is increasingly dangerous, murder rate climbing once again, about 6th highest in 
world 
and i encounter a lot of racism, especially from young thugs—not so much hostility as disrespect—they regard 
me as an easy target—that old white man nah know nothing, we can rob him or do as we please 
yesterday morning at 7am very hostile encounter at an **ATM** machine, no overt attempt to rob me or i would 
have shot him dead, just cursing me and my mother out because he had to wait an extra minute or two while i 
did my transaction—all my Jamaican male friends agree that he would not have acted that way toward a dark-
skinned man 
makes me reluctant so spend so much time here or to continue to invest in my property 
i hope you are fine, the **Trump** bump in the market seems to have stalled and i would be curious what you 
thought of the market over **the next three years**—i will be forcibly retired **July 1** but as long as i have 
'employment' (equals fellowships at the moment) for **a couple of years** i need not spend my retirement money 
which will be roughly $900,000; at most i might put 450 grand in an annuity and keep the rest invested 
all the best
