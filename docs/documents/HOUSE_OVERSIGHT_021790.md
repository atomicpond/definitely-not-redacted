Margie, 
IT As you know, nothing too big or too small for us, especially in the summer IT Hmmmmm. I have to be 
direct -- you or someone at your paper was very astute in checking the Clerk and Comptroller's computer 
and activity in the Epstein case **two days** before the hearing. As result, you sent me a text message on 
**Saturday** asking what the activity was about and I confirmed that the plea would take place. You were 
the only member of the news media that I talked with. And yet, after the case is completely over, the 
**Palm Beach** Daily News' editorial staff remains silent on the topic. 
Thanks, 
Mike 
**Palm Beach** Post Editorial 
**Monday, **July 07, 2008**** 
**two years** after a grand jury indicted him on a felony charge of solicitation of prostitution, Jeffrey Epstein 
finally admitted that he lured a teenage girl to his $8.5 million, 13,000-square-foot **Palm Beach** mansion for 
sex. **A week ago**, the **55-year-old** investment banker began serving **18 months** in jail. 
But that plea deal - guilty of felony solicitation of prostitution and procuring a person under the age of 18 for 
prostitution - does not account for all five of the girls, one as young as 14, who alleged that Epstein sexually 
abused them. And why is Epstein serving his term in the overcrowded ******Palm Beach** County** Jail** and not a state 
prison, where inmates are sent if their sentences are longer than **one year**? 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021790 
The slow, dissatisfying resolution of the case sends a message to the public that there's a different system of 
justice for the wealthy who hire high-powered lawyers. Epstein's legal team included **West **Palm Beach**** defense 
attorney **Jack Goldberger**, ****Harvard Law School**** Professor Alan Dershowitz, who defended O.J. Simpson 
against murder charges, and **Kenneth Starr**, the prosecutor who pursued then-President Bill Clinton for lying 
about sex with young women. 
**Palm Beach** police spent **11 months** investigating Epstein before State Attorney **Barry Krischer** sent the case to 
a grand jury, instead of charging Epstein so the man who once boasted of accepting only billionaire clients 
could face a trial. The police had taken a high school transcript, class schedules and phone messages from 
Epstein's home that showed he knew the girls were underage. Yet Mr. Krischer was more swayed by Epstein's 
lawyers, who attempted to impugn the girls' character by showing they had chatted on **myspace.com** about 
smoking marijuana and drinking. He should have let a jury decide whether the victims - and Epstein - were 
credible. 
Ultimately, one charge against Epstein finally reflected the age of one victim, and the plea agreement left 
Epstein labeled a sex offender. With that additional charge, if Epstein had been convicted at a trial, he could 
have been sentenced to anything from probation to **15 years** in prison, Assistant State Attorney Lanna 
Belohlavek said, adding that the recommended guideline sentence was **21 months**. 
Epstein also won't have to certify to the court that he is receiving counseling, typically required of sex 
offenders, because he has a private psychiatrist. But without court supervision, who will ensure Epstein is in 
fact being treated? 
The plea deal also drops a federal investigation of Epstein. If a federal investigation was warranted, how does 
dropping it before completion benefit the public? 
Epstein preyed on girls and denied it. For **three years**, his wealth and the influence of his lawyers bought him 
the protection the state attorney owed to the victims. 
Police chief's reputation helps discredit attacks

In the case of **Palm Beach** financier Jeffrey Epstein, it seems, at times, as if two men are accused of 
wrongdoing: Epstein and **Palm Beach** Police **Chief **Michael Reiter****. 
Epstein, 53, was indicted **last month** on a charge of felony solicitation of prostitution solely because of Reiter's 
"craziness," one of Epstein's lawyers said. His department disseminated "a di
