﻿GEMs Paper #26
Saudi Arabia: beyond oil but not so fast
30 June 2016 Corrected
Unauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited. This report is intended for amanda.ens@baml.com
Transforming Saudi Arabia, but challenges abound
The Saudi National Transformation Plan (NTP) bodes well for comprehensive reform
efforts to diversify the economy in line with Vision 2030. The NTP a) identifies key
sectors with high growth potential; b) starts to articulate supportive public sector
industrial strategies; and c) seeks to foster higher value-added through enhancements to
processes, products and organizations. Still, ambitious targets in a number of sectors are
unlikely to be reached and medium-term macro sustainability is not yet clear.
USD peg holds but NTP inconsistent with stable FX policy
Our view is still that the USD peg holds. However, the NTP provides a mixed message.
On the one hand, it blurs policymaking incentives given the need for a competitive Fx if
diversification progresses. On the other, unrealistic fiscal targets mean consolidation is
likely to fall short of easing imbalances materially without oil price recovery. Energy
policy thus likely needs to become less aggressive to support macro and FX policies.
Eurobond premium required for fiscal slippage risk
We expect large and regular sovereign Eurobond issuance to support FX reserves and
domestic liquidity but to weigh on regional bond spreads if risk appetite does not hold
up or fiscal balance slips. EMBIG index inclusion is unlikely, in our view. Saudi forwards,
CDS and rates are likely to stay under pressure due to issuance and tight liquidity.
Commodities: NTP adds to medium-term oil tightness
The NTP suggestion that production capacity is maintained until 2020 reinforces our
conviction of medium-term oil market tightness. The NTP gas production target that
could displace domestic crude demand and boost export capacity is challenging.
Equity Strategy: six investible themes on the back of NTP
We see a number of investible themes emerging from the NTP which investors can use
to identify potential beneficiaries. These themes include rising availability of affordable
housing, increased access to healthcare, down-trading as the consumer comes under
pressure, a surge in telecom infrastructure and significant opportunities in the
downstream petrochemical arena. Buy-rated names with access to these themes
include: Al Hammadi, Savola, Al Othaim, STC, Zain KSA and SABIC.
Partial NTP success & MSCI inclusion could drive rerating
The Saudi market trades on a 12m fwd P/E of c.13x, an 11% discount to the long-term
average and its lowest premium to GEMs since 2010. We believe that with earnings
momentum gradually reaching an inflection point a relatively negative outlook is already
being priced in. Given our view that oil prices will gain strong momentum in 2017, even
a partial success of the NTP along with CMA market reforms to expedite inclusion in the
MSCI EM index could be sufficient to improve confidence and thus drive a rerating.
