﻿Notes from **Aspen** Strategy Group



US Policy on Arab Revolutions

TJP summary:  Plenty of different opinions on what was done right and wrong.  No consensus.  



Indyk: **Syria** will spill into **Bahrain** and **KSA** (Saudi). We should have moved earlier.  **KSA** is a BFD.  

Feaver (ex Bush):  BO's obsession w anti Bush (especially wrt **Iraq**) has unnecessarily limited Administrations ability to engage in **Iraq** which -as we see now w **Syria** - is just dumb. 

Dannzinger (ex Obama Admin):  obama has done a remarkable job and the only way he could have done better is if I had held a senior post in the **Administration**. 

Kahl (ex Obama Admin) : Feaver is living in a fantsy world. BO couldn't make a SOFA deal w NAM. He tried, but we had no leverage and Iraqis wanted to break sense of  occupation. So President went to zero based engagement  and now wants to build engagement w **Iraq** from zero base. 

Flornoy:  Feaver, you make me feel like I lived in a different reality.  Did a good job of articulating "lead from behind" strat in **Libya**.  When you consider our national interests in the context of our domestic condition, we did the best we could. 

Zelikow: what are the top priorities of admin.  Defeat AQ and avoid a "pre mature  war w **Iran**; avoid Iraqi civil war - **Iraq** is moving troops now to west; manage the hot situations in ME. 

Froman: "lead fom behind" is not admin policy.  Leverage our resources and those of our allies. 

Hadley: now in era of big bets. We need to define our objectives and spot moments when we should lead and take a big bet. 

Maghan O: advancing our interests w a  Lead from behind or a light handed approach will only work if a numner of assumptions are accurate (eg Muslim Bro will moderate; monarchy -**KSA**- will self reform). These are big assumptions and therefore using a light hand may fail. Agrees w Hadly that there are times we should take a big bet and **Iraq** would have been an example of that. 

Indyk: we need to engage more in **Syria**. It is a regional lynch pin and lead from behind won't work. 

Feaver:  Dannzinger is uncharacteristically wrong. A different approach 4 yrs ago would have left us in better positions in **Iran** **Iraq** and **Syria**. 











**Iraq** 

TJP summary:  Obama has been unable to find a way to keep a US voice in **Iraq**.  **Iraq** is a big deal and US has just disappeared.  Admin says that NAM (**Iraq** PM) has kept us out; Bush people say that Obama has walked away.  





Maghan O’:  We should have kept resid force in **Iraq**.  Most important function would have been keeping a healthy tension between the central govt and new institutions.  For **10 years** **Iraq** has had a centralized power base.  With removal of US, you took away support for new institutions.  Iraqis view removal of forces as a sign we don’t care.  




Jim Steinberg:  Could get that done.  President was committed to keeping some troops in **Iraq** and used his leverage to try and get that done.  President supported NAM in hopes of getting a new SOFA. Tried  everything.  We could not deploy forces without deal on immunity.  We need to now focus on how can we now engage.  This is going to be hard to do without support (financial, security etc.)





MO:  President ignored lessons of 2008 SOFA negotiations.  There, we got creative on immunity.  





JS: NAM said he could do SOFA but couldn’t take it to **Parliament**.  We insisted on going to **Parliament** beacause attys said without that we wouldn’t have a binding deal. 





MO:  Will **Iraq** hold together?  More challenges now that I have seen since **2003**, but still more likely than not.  NAM is consolidating power in last 9 mos which sends a msg to Kurds that they don’t like.  If NAM kills democracy, then Kurds leave the union.  The US should help **Turkey** and **Baghdad** resovlve their issues.  Portraying **Turkey** as a model and **Iraq** as a bad guy is counter productive.  **Turkey** is trying to undermine Shia role in **Iraq**.





JS:  External forces will affect **Iraq**.  We need to keep incentives for all parties to keep country together.  





MO:  **Iraq** is most vulnerable to **Iran** when it is weak and divided and we haven’t done enough to help **Iraq**.  Iraqi’s are worried that an Assad exit will push **Iran** to double down on **Iraq**.  





JS:  limit **Iran**’s influence on **Iraq** by isolating **Iran** in region.  Reducing **Iran**’s incluence in region is key. But **Iraq** also has to get its act together and be more cohesive.  President has made a big bet on Erdogan and **Turkey**.  





Scowcroft:  What are **Turkey**’s objectives in **Iraq**?





Steinberg:  Kurd separation is their focus.  Building a relationship with Iraqi Kurds is a route for **Turkey**.  They don’t like NAM and Shia – sunni split plays a role in **Turkey**’s attitude towards **Iraq**.  





MO:  **Turkey** sees **Iraq** and Iraqi Kurds as a source of energy. **Turkey** doesn’t necessarily like the idea of an indep. Kurdish state.   Also comments that there are limits to **Iran**’s influence in **Iraq**.  Sadr is becoming an Iraqi nationalist.  He wants to get rid of NAM.  Fluid political dynamics in **Iraq**.
