Mueller's **Fruit of the Poisonous Tree** 
It makes no difference how honorable he is. His investigation is tainted by the bias that

Special counsel **Robert Mueller's** investigation may face a serious legal obstacle: It is tainted by 
antecedent political bias. The June 14 report from **Michael horowitz**, **the **Justice Department****'s 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026477 
inspector general, unearthed a pattern of anti-Trump bias by high-ranking officials at the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation. Some of their communications, the report says, were "not only indicative of a 
biased state of mind but imply a willingness to take action to impact a presidential candidate's 
electoral prospects." Although Mr. Horowitz could not definitively ascertain whether this bias 
"directly affected" specific FBI actions in the **Hillary Clinton** email investigation, it nonetheless 
affects the legality of the Trump-Russia collusion inquiry, code-named ****Crossfire Hurricane****. 
Crossfire was launched only months before the 2016 election. Its FBI progenitors—the same ones 
who had investigated Mrs. Clinton—deployed at least one informant to probe Trump campaign 
advisers, obtained ****Foreign Intelligence Surveillance** Court** wiretap warrants, issued national security 
letters to gather records, and unmasked the identities of campaign officials who were surveilled. They 
also repeatedly leaked investigative information. 
Mr. Horowitz is separately scrutinizing Crossfire and isn't expected to finish for months. But the 
current report reveals that FBI officials displayed not merely an appearance of bias against Donald 
Trump, but animus bordering on hatred. Peter Strzok, who led both the Clinton and Trump 
investigations, confidently assuaged a colleague's fear that Mr. Trump would become president: "No 
he won't. We'll stop it." An unnamed FBI lawyer assigned to Crossfire told a colleague he was 
"devastated" and "numb" after Mr. Trump won, while declaring to another FBI attorney: "Viva le 
resistance." 
The report highlights the FBI's failure to act promptly upon discovering that **Anthony Weiner's** laptop 
contained thousands of Mrs. Clinton's emails. Investigators justified the delay by citing the "higher 
priority" of Crossfire. But Mr. Horowitz writes: "We did not have confidence that Strzok's decision to 
prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on [the] investigative lead discovered on the 
Weiner laptop was free from bias." 
Similarly, although Mr. Horowitz found no evidence that then-FBI **Director James Comey** was trying 
to influence the election, Mr. Comey did make decisions based on political considerations. He told the 
inspector general that his election-eve decision to reopen the Clinton email investigation was 
motivated by a desire to protect her assumed presidency's legitimacy. 
The inspector general wrote that Mr. Strzok's text messages "created the appearance that investigative 
decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations." The report adds, importantly, that "most 
of the text messages raising such questions pertained to the Russia investigation." Given how biases 
ineluctably shape behavior, these facts create a strong inference that by squelching the Clinton 
investigation and building a narrative of Trump-Russia collusion, a group of government officials 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026478 
I sought to bolster Mrs. Clinton's electoral chances and, if the unthinkable happened, obtain an 
insurance policy to cripple the Trump administration with accusations of illegitimacy. 
What does this have to do with Mr. Mueller, who was appointed in May 2017 after **President Trump** 
fired Mr. Comey? The inspector general concludes that the pervasive bias "cast a cloud over the FBI 
investigations to which these employees were assigned," including Crossfire. And if Crossfire was 
politically motivated, then its culmination, the appointment of a special counsel, inherited the taint. All 
special-counsel activities—investigations, plea deals, subpoenas, reports, indictments and 
convictions—are fruit of a poisonous tree, byproducts of a violation of due process. That Mr.
