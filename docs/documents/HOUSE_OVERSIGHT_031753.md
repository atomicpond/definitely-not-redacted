﻿Operation Chaos Lives
By ****Paul** krassner**
If a psychologist testing you in a free association method said “Vietnam War deserters” you most likely would reply “**Canada**.” However, Matthew Sweet, the British author of Operation Chaos: The Vietnam Deserters Who Fought the **CIA**, the Brainwashers, and Themselves, would definitely respond “**Stockholm**,” as proven by his nonfiction book’s comprehensive research. By **1968**, more than a thousand deserters and draft resisters had escaped to **Sweden**.                                                                                                                     
     Many of them formed a group named the American Deserters Committee.  That ADC might just as well have served it as insane inadvertently satire. For example, a few friends kept a woman in her in her apartment, playing **Beethoven** in an attempt to reprogram her brain. An individual insisted that the **Beatles** were created as an instrument of psychological warfare. And the author himself became to believe the genocidal ambitions of Her Majesty Queen **Elizabeth**’s secret plot to start World War III. And now, for whatever purpose, Donald **Trump** has met the same Majesty Queen **Elizabeth**.                                     
     Back In January 1974, journalists and activists whistle-blowers revealed the truth that there was a takeover by the **CIA** of **the United States**. Indeed, Lyndon LaRouche, the leader of a growing cult, spoke as his longtime alias, Lyn **Marcus**, to the audience in a **New York** shabby ballroom. He began describing the second phase of a psy-war game designed by the **CIA**, conducted on four continents, turning some of their most trusted colleagues into killers, drugged and imprisoned, reconditioned their minds, erased their memories of the experience, and returned to their friends as unknowing vehicles of a murderous conspiracy.
     The American **CIA** was then to be performed at a secret facility near **Stockholm**, where **Marcus** explained how brainwashed candidates were hypnotized, subjected to electric shocks, forced to eat their own excrement, endure sexual humiliation, and tortured until they whined like puppies. Once they had been reduced to mental pulp, the programming began.
     A literal kind of programming, following the rules of the computer age. Numbers linked to functions. Infinite loops of coded instructions, drilled into the subject by repetition, violence, the application of electrodes to bare skin. Finally, cyanide pills had been secreted inside their bodies, in order to eliminate the killers once they had fulfilled their programs. 
     No wonder Sweet admitted, “If I were to die without finishing this book, then someone out there would undoubtedly set up a Web page claiming that I’d been bumped off, by either the **CIA**, the Swedish secret services, or the bizarre political group that had once counted many of my interviewees as its members—and would, by the time my research was concluded, come to regard me as an enemy infiltrator. And that was then I knew I’d been swallowed by my own story. Swallowed, but not brainwashed.” He’s still alive.
     Back in **New York**, at the National Caucus of Labor Committees, **Marcus** was the leader of Students for a Democratic Society. For better or worse, he was delivering a charismatic economics lecture to an enthusiastic SDS crowd. In **1968** that summer, they protested the Vietnam War at the National Democratic Convention in **Chicago**. The Yippies nominated a pig as a presidential candidate, and I started a rumor that we planned to drop LSD into the reservoir. And yes, Lyndon LaRouche decided to drop his alias into pure manure.
     He was an unlovable conspiracy theorist who ran for the U.S. presidency eight times. He played himself as a cartoon character in an episode of The Simpsons in which aliens kidnapped presidential candidates Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, Immersing them in tanks of bubbling pink liquid. Homer shouted, “Oh my God! Lyndon LaRouche was right!” And Saturday Night Live featured “Lyndon LaRouche Theater,” in which Randy Quaid played LaRouche, with a bald wig, bow-tie and spectacles, narrating melodramatic twists, conspiracies, and confessing “I am insane.”

     Not mentioned in the book, near the end of March 1981, I delivered a keynote address at the Youth International Party convention in **New York**. These were the latterday Yippies, originally launched as the anti-Yippie “Zippies” during the **1972** both conventions in **Miami**. I asked the audience a rhetorical question, “How would you like to be a Secret Service agent guarding Ronald **Reagan**, knowing that his vice president, George Bush, is the former head of the **CIA**?”
     Once again, satire would be outdistanced by reality. On **March 30**, the president was shot by John Hinckley in order to make a favorable impression on actress **Jodie Foster** so that he could take her bowling on a date. Ironicallly, Hinckley came out for gun control, and **Reagan** came out against it.
I was scheduled to perform stand-up at B
