﻿IN **the Circuit Court** OF THE FIFTEENTH
**Judicial Circuit**, IN AND FOR PALM
BEACH COUNTY, FLORIDA
JEFFREY EPSTEIN,
CASE NO.: 502009CA040800XXXXMBAG
Plaintiff,
vs.
SCOTT ROTHSTEIN, individually, BRADLEY J.
EDWARDS, individually, and L.M., individually,
Defendant,
DEFENDANT/COUNTER-PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO
PLAINTIFF/COUNTER-DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR **Summary Judgment** ON
DEFENDANT/COUNTER-PLAINTIFF'S FOURTH AMENDED COUNTERCLAIM
Defendant/Counter-Plaintiff **Bradley J. Edwards**, by and through his undersigned counsel, hereby
submits this Response in Opposition to Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Jeffrey Epstein's Motion for
**Summary Judgment**. Epstein seeks **Summary Judgment** on the claims of abuse of process and malicious
prosecution set forth in Brad Edwards' Fourth Amended Counterclaim. Each of the grounds asserted in
support of Epstein's Motion for **Summary Judgment** are without merit and must be denied.
In Epstein's Amended Complaint he carries forth the essence of all claims asserted in his original
Complaint. In that pleading Epstein essentially alleges that Edwards joined Rothstein in the abusive
prosecution of sexual assault cases against Epstein to "pump" the cases to Ponzi scheme investors. The
purported "proof' of the allegations against Edwards, as referenced in the Second Amended Complaint
and in Epstein's Motion for **Summary Judgment**, includes Edwards' alleged contacts with the media, his
attempts to obtain discovery from high profile persons with whom Epstein socialized, press reports of
Rothstein's known illegal activities, the use of "ridiculously inflammatory' language and arguments in
court. But as the evidence submitted in opposition to Epstein's Motion for **Summary Judgment** reflects,
Epstein filed his claims and continued to pursue claims despite his knowledge that his claims could never
be successful because they were both false and unsupported by any reasonable belief of suspicion that

they were true. Epstein knew that he had in fact molested each of the minors represented by Brad
Edwards. He also knew that each litigation decision by Brad Edwards was grounded in proper litigation
judgment about the need to pursue effective discovery against Epstein, particularly in the face of
Epstein's stonewalling tactics.
Epstein also knew that he suffered no legally cognizable injury
proximately caused by the falsely alleged wrongdoing on the part of Edwards. Moreover, Epstein had no
intention of waiving his **Fifth Amendment** privilege against self-incrimination in order to avoid providing
relevant and material discovery that Epstein would need in the course of prosecuting his claims and to
which Edwards was entitled in defending those claims. Epstein knew that his prosecution of his claims
would be barred by the sword-shield doctrine.
Most significantly, the evidence submitted in the
supporting papers would compel a fact finder to determine that Epstein had no basis in law or in fact to
pursue his claims against Edwards and that Epstein was motivated by a single ulterior motive to attempt
to intimidate Edwards and his clients and others into abandoning or settling their legitimate claims for
less than their just and reasonable value. The evidence demonstrates that Epstein did not file these claims
for the purpose of collecting money damages since he knew that he never suffered any damage as a
consequence of any alleged wrongdoing by Edwards but filed the claim to require Edwards to expend
time, energy and resources on his own defense, to embarrass Edwards and impugn his integrity and deter
others with legitimate claims against Epstein from pursuing those claims.
Indeed, the evidence
demonstrates that Epstein continued to pursue his claims by filing the Second Amended Complaint
alleging abuse of process against Edwards even after he had paid significant sums in settlement of the
claims instituted by Mr. Edwards' clients against Mr. Epstein!
The evidence marshalled in support of these assertions is set forth in the previously filed documents in this Court.
Those documents include Exhibit "A" — Edwards' Statement of **Undisputed Facts**; Exhibit "B" — Edwards' Renewed
Motion for **Summary Judgment**; Exhibit "C" — Edwards' October 19, 2012 Second Renewed Motion for Leave to
Assert Claim for Punitive Damages; Exhibit "D" — Edwards' Notice of Filing of Transcript of Telephone Interview
of Virginia Roberts in Support of Motion for Leave to Amended to Assert Punitive Damages; Exhibit "E" —
Transcript of Deposition of Jeffrey Epstein dated January 25, 2012; Exhibit "F' — Deposition of **Bradley Edwards**
dated March 23, 2010; Exhibit "G" - Deposition of Scott Rothstein dated June 14, 2012; Exhibit "H" — Order of
