Importance: High 
My Mom's childhood friend from **Ukraine** reached out to her - she works for Oleksandr Vilkul (Ukraninan 
opposition leader), asked if I could help organize the invitation to the **Trump** inauguration for a high reward. 
Shall I find out the details or drop it? Any interest in meeting them at all 
I personally don't know Tamara (my Mom's friend) and my Mom hasn't seen her for **years**
