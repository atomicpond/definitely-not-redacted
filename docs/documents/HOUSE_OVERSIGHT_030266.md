Lawyer Alan Dershowitz has said that he still represents 
convicted pedophile **Jeffrey **Epstein****, who pleaded guilty to 
soliciting underage sexual partners whom he initially 
recruited as masseurs. Dershowitz, 80, told Axios that 
**Epstein** "has called me a couple of times about legal issues, 
because I'm still technically his lawyer," adding, "I haven't 
had any social, or any other kind of contact [but] you never 
stop being a person's lawyer." Dershowitz told Axios that 
**Epstein** lent his family his **Palm Beach**, **Florida**, **HOUSE** and 
that he received a "therapeutic massage with an old old 
Russian" there, but he'd had no idea "anything improper had 
even taken place in that **HOUSE**." While he was allegedly 
raping teenage girls, **Epstein** cultivated relationships with a 
global elite: Bill Clinton flew on **Epstein**'s plane, nicknamed 
the "**Lolita Express**," numerous times; Prince Andrew's ex-
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 030266 
wife borrowed money from him; and Donald Trump praised 
him as a "terrific guy."
