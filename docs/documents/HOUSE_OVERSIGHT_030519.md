From: ****Jeffrey** **Epstein**** [jeeyacation@gmail.com] 
Sent: 3/8/2011 1:48:24 AM 
To: **Darren** lndyke 
Details of the disturbing lifestyle led by ****Jeffrey** **Epstein**** emerged last night after the Daily 
**Mail** uncovered logs of telephone messages left at his **Florida** child sex den. 
Schoolchildren were among hundreds of callers who apparently rang to arrange massages 
for the 58-year-old billionaire friend of Prince Andrew, who was later convicted of child sex 
offences. 
**Ghislaine **Maxwell****, 49-year-old daughter of the disgraced media mogul **Robert **Maxwell****, is 
named in several messages. 
In one left for her or '**Sarah**', a caller says she 'doesn't know at what time she must come 
this night for the massage'. Other messages for **Epstein**, the sources of which are not clear, 
contain such phrases as: 'She has females for Mr JE' and 'I have a female for him'. 
Another with sickening overtones comes from someone called Jeanluc for **Epstein**: 'He just 
did a good one — **18 years**. (She spoke to me and said, "I love **Jeffrey**")'. 
The long list of women is punctuated by regular references to **Epstein**'s celebrity friends 
including the business magnate Donald Trump, film producer **Harvey Weinstein** and 
magician **David Copperfield**, referred to as 'Magic David'. 
The sheer volume of phone traffic shows the frequency of **Epstein**'s massages, many of 
which were 'erotic' and allegedly involved the abused girls. 
The evidence is from documents confiscated by police during a criminal investigation into 
**Epstein** and seen **yesterday** by the **Mail**.

Message from a child asking what time to leave school 
---n-----e-__ 
Miss **Maxwell** is asked when a girl should give a massage 
One message left for **Epstein** reads: 'She is wondering if 2.30 ok cuz she needs to stay in 
school.' 
It was left in **February 2005** — **the same year** that the mother of a **14-year-old** girl alerted 
police to **Epstein**'s abuse. 
Another note shows that 'Colleen' phoned to tell **Epstein**: 'Going into class — will be out in 
45 mm.' 
Last night the **Daily **Mail**** tried to contact the people whose names and telephone numbers 
are included in the logs. 
One girl named Jenny, who had left her number, hung up immediately when asked about 
**Epstein**. 
A man listed only as **Darren** said: 'I have no comment to make on that.'
