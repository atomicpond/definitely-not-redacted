Subject: the story 
Importance: High 
1. all the girls discussed in the press , came to the **HOUSE** , to give erotic massages. each and every girl , each 
time, came in exchange for money. many of the girls interviewed were in their mid twenties early thirties, no 
searching for underage girls. many of the girls worked in the local massage parlors. ( advertised everyday in 
the **Palm Beach** papers. , referred in the local vernacular to " **Jack** shacks". 5 within 4 miles of the intl airpot. 
) or strip clubs.. ( both of the girls bringing the cvra case ). 
2. There have been discussios of a **HOUSE** full of underage photos. the video taken by the police contradict that 
in its entirety 
3 there have been discsussion about hidden video cameras, they were put there with the HELP of the local 
Police , in order to catch a thief money had been going missing , and the police cam , set up cameras, and 
**One night** hid in the bushes hoping to catch the thief in the act. It turned out to be the houseman. who 
confessed, . there were never any hidden cameras anywhere besides the garage and the camera in the living 
room focused on the place where money was kept 
4. The police conducted a search, and found adult sextoys, I am an adult, they made a point to say that there 
was a purple plastic sex toy„ but later without correcting their earliler assertion disconver it was nothing but a 
salad fork 
5. The girl whose parents initiated the investigation, told the police in a sworn statment that she had lied about 
her age to gain access to the **HOUSE**. she said she tried her best to appear over 18 , as she wanted to be invited 
back, there was not trolling for anyone underage. 
6. many if not most of the girls , invited their friends , best friends after they had left. hardly a normal result 
if there had been any coercion or anytrhing untoward. 
7, many of the girls had their boyfirends wait downstairs, or in some instances their parents. not one 
time did anyone ever complain of mistreatment , 
8 there was never ever any drugs , alcolhol, threats, coercion 
9 the local sex crimes prosecutor, lana belahovilc , interviewed the girls herself , and concluded in her own 
words dire wer no real victims here. just local prostituion. she offer a 5 year probation sentence with no 
registration. . **Alan** dershowitwz told me I shouldnt take it. it was too dangerous. not telling me that my 
probation would have been moved to my home in the virigin islands. then the prosecutors to be 
fair presented their information to a grand jury, the ONLY time a jury would see any of the claims, the result 
was a charge of soliction of prostituion . a crime with a mandatory release after taking a harms of prostiution 
course. This was a grand jury determination. 
10. local. no transportation across state lines, contrary to outragious and hbeious 
allegations, no trafficking. it is a disservice to women who are trafficked to compare a woman brought into 
the country , tied to a bed, given drugs to have sex with strangers for money that she doesnt get. . to girsl who 
took a taxi to my **HOUSE**, had food snacks and got paid, then went shopping with her friedns and back home. 
11/ the **FBI** decided to pursue a highly unusual case. their position was that my secretary , not ire, called girls 
on the telephone and asked them if they would like to work. . many times as the message pads reveall the 
girls called over and over again askking to work, hardly coercion ( the latest 
cases REQURE coercion, which states it is NOT for making appts ....... 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 030245 
12 THe **FBI**, threatend many statutes if i would not plead guilty to a state crime, they suggested that a cell 
phone was a means of interstae commerce ( similar to perverts who troll the intern& , in searhc of underage 
girsl , and in each and every one of those cases the govt is required to confirm , and they do,that the person 
KNEW or that the person on the other end of the computer was underage. . all stings hve the police stinger ask 
dont you know that i am 14, 13 etc. there was never any such conversation with anyone. 
13. the govt said that traveling to my homeof 15 year in **Florida**, ccould be considered traveling for thepurpsoe 
of underage sex. never before anyone not crossing state lines with a person , charged with a crimge for going 
home 
14. the gov said that they would not bring an indictment if i plead guilty to being a pimp.( a crime in **Florida** 
that REQUIRES the pimpt to earh money off the the girls , ( regster as a sex offender ) and pay a list of girls 
whose names they would provide me only AF l'ER the fact. and AF l'ER i was in jail. I would have to agree 
NOT to contest any claim by anyone they put on the list . when I attempted to do so , as i never met some of 
the people on the list. I reived a letter stating that any attempt to question their story would result in
