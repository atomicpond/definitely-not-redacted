its doable , but time consuming, there are many leaders of countries we can organize for you to have one on 
ones. however. you will have to come , stay 8 -10 days. , then no more than two weeks later. the

insider, not an outsider flying in and out. did you get the first cut of american carnage?.?

Subject: Re: 
Bannon the European: He's opening the populist fort in **Brussels** 
The former **Trump** strategist arrives in **Europe** with "The **Movement**". Objective: an alliance between 
right-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections 
NEW YORK. The invasion of **Europe** has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru who 
was Donald **Trump**'s right-hand man in the **White **HOUSE**** — but let go **last summer** following the 
racist violence in **Charlottesville** — is preparing to march on **Brussels**. Launching, he told the Daily 
Beast himself, a new non-profit foundation called The **Movement**, (II **Movimento**), right in the heart 
of **Europe** and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view of the 
European elections which will be held in **spring 2019**. 
Objective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor of 
**the Democratic party**, who since 1984 with his **Open Society** has spent at least $32 billion in support 
of NGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist right, 
accused of plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in order to 
have labour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on **Twitter** also by the current Minister of the 
Interior Matteo Salvini. 
The ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in 
the European campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in **London** and 
Rome — is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great "populist international" of which he 
has long since been dreaming. 
The **Movement**, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic 
advice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European 
movements. Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling 
funding. 
The aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of "super group" that if victorious can conquer up to a 
third of **the **European Parliament**** in the elections **next May**. 
Indeed — putting the common policy of **the Old Continent** in the hands of Bannon and his own. The 
American strategist is very attached to the **Freedom Caucus** — the extreme right of the US Congress 
— and in 2014 he was at the top of the ****Cambridge** Analytica** company, which in 2016 used data 
stolen from **Facebook** to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald **Trump** emerged 
victor. It is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to West. 
And he has already met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, **the French Marine Le Pen** and the 
former leader of the British separatists **Nigel Farage**. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on **Friday** 
in **Pennsylvania**, USA, to a fundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman **Lou Barletta**. Without 
forgetting the Italians of Lega and 5 stars. Of them, he said: "If it works in **Italy**, we can import the 
model anywhere". 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 019317 
The **Movement**, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. In 
short, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries 
support
