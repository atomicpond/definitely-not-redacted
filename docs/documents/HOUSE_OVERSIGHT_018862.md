Prosecutor's home destroyed in suspected arson on St. Croix
By LOU MATTEt
****Daily News** Staff**
**St. Thomas** - v.1. Police and .
V.1. Fire Service officials on St.
Croix are investigating what they
say is suspected arson at the home
of a criminal prosecutor for the v.1.
Attorney General's Office.
The Estate St. George home of
Assistant Attorney General Kip
Roberson was fully engulfed in
flames when five Fire Service trucks
responded to a 911 call about 11
a.m. Thursday, according to St.
Croix Fire Chief Angel Torres Sr.
and Attorney General Vincent
Frazer.
Torres estimated that the borne
had been burning for about 15 minutes
before the call came in. He said
firefighters had to force their way
through a motorized gate to gain
access to the burning house. No one
was inside, and no one was hurt in
tbe blaze, but the home was completely
destroyed, Torres said.
"It's a total loss," Torres said.
Torres said firefighter.; also found
that surveillance cameras at the
. home had been tampered with.,
"Someone cut the wires," he said.
"The wires was pulled out and the
screens were pulled out and thrown
in the bushes."
Torres said firefighters found evidence
of tampering on the doors to
the home, which appeared that
someone had tried to pry the doors
open. The Fire Service did not leave
the scene until 3:20 p.m., Torres
said.
Torres -said Thursday evening that
the Fire Service bad not contacted
any witnesses at that point and that
Roberson's borne was located in an
isolated area. He said he believed
Roberson shared the home with
another attorney, but he did not
know the attorney's name.
"Apparently they were a couple,
but it's an ongoing investigation,"
Torres said. "We gotta really follow
up on some leads and stuff we're
looking at."
Roberson could not be reached
for comment Thursday evening.
Frazer declined to comment about
Roberson's living situation. The
attorney general said late Thursday
Elections boards' slow vote count violates V.I. law
By LOU MATTEI
****Daily News** Staff**
**St. Thomas** - Both Boards of Elections
in **the **Virgin Islands**** have run afoul of the V.I.
Code and board policies in the wake of
Tuesday's general election, from which paper
ballots are still being tallied.
The V:1. Code requires the boards to count the
votes for each candidate within a day of receiving
ballot materials from the polling places:
''Each board of elections, afIer having received
all statements, books, lists, papers, vouchers,
ballots, ballot boxes and district register from
each polling district and polling place in its distric�
shall convene not later than one day following
the receipt thereof and determine the total
number of votes cast in the election district for
each candidate."
. The law states that the boards must convene
no later than three days afIer receiving the aforementioned
materials to tally votes for the Board
of Education and Board of Elections races.
On Tuesday, a majority of the votes from all
races were cast on electronic machines, and
results from those ballots were available within
hours of the polls closing.
However, widespread diSbUSt of the machines
led to a spike in the use of paper ballots - more
than 4,500
vote count and, in effect, hampered the boards'
abilities to comply with the law.
Today marks the third day since the boards
received all the ballots from the polling sites
Tuesday night.
The **St. Thomas**-St. John Board hopes to fiuish
counting the Senate races by the end of the
day today before moving on to other races,
according to board member Lorna Thomas.
The St. Croix Board is scheduled to begin
counting its 2,781 paper ballots today.
