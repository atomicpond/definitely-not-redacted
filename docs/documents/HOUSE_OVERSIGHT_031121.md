**Global Asset Allocation** 

________________________________

The **J.P. Morgan** View: Go **East**.

 

Click here <http://emaillink.jpmorgan.com/t/AQ/AAGO5g/AAMcAQ/OFFmSw/EGA/ABYQPQ/AQ/16gv>  for the full Note and disclaimers.

 

*         Asset allocation –– The growth gap between **East** and **West** is widening, and has allowed us to join the Obama Pivot towards **Asia**. We stay long **Japan** and EM **Asia** in equities on stronger signs of an economic rebound in the **East**, while we again cut growth numbers for the US and **Europe**. 

*         Economics –– Weaker activity data force us to lower Q4 for the US from 1.5% to 0.8% and the Euro area from -1.5% to -1.8%. But strong trade and industrial data in **Asia**, as well as more fiscal easing in **Japan**, have induced us to raise Japanese growth for the 3rd time in a row, and to signal upside risk on **China**. 

*         Fixed Income –– Go long duration in the US as we see yields mean reverting and we are not quite high in the **6-month** range. 

*         Equities –– Strong retail buying is adding fuel to equity markets. 

*         Credit –– Idiosyncrasies driving relative performance signals a welcome move-away from the one-factor-drives-all world of late. 

*         Currencies –– Staying short JPY. Be also short USD but against AUD, RUB and KRW. 

*         Commodities –– Our main trades are long industrial metals, US natural gas, and **Brent** time spreads vs. short agriculture. 

*         Another good **week** for risk markets with equities and credit rallying further, but **this **week**** without a selloff in bonds. Much of the rally in equities is likely the aftermath of the last minute escape from Fiscal Cliff 1 on ****December** 31**. But since then, we have also seen a sudden surge in equity fund inflows, which seem incongruous with lukewarm incoming data and thus may well come from investors who missed ****last year**'s** stock market rally. In **2012**, fund investors poured $680bn into bond mutual funds and ETFs, while taking some $23bn out of equity funds. 

*         Given the recent vintage of these equity fund inflows, they are unlikely to reverse quickly as there is not a lot of profit on them yet. Near-term momentum thus remains good for stocks, in our view. At the same time, the more bullish sentiment on stocks is now sending a contrarian signal. **last year**, we based much of our long equity recommendation on our impression that most market participants saw more downside risk across the globe than we thought would become realized. This does not appear to be the case anymore, as the main remaining market concern is only about Fiscal Cliff 2. No more talk of Chinese hard landing or a Greek exit. Hence, the case for being long risk assets is more value based, rather than the reversal in risk perceptions which we think has largely happened by now. We would therefore describe our remaining longs in equities and credit as modest and medium term. 

*	 

*         We could again be induced to move our equity overweight to an “aggressive” level, if there were to be reason to raise growth and earnings projections. All we have so far is improved forward looking indicators – largely PMIs and positive feedback from asset markets – that are signaling a pickup in growth **this quarter**. But so far, this is simply confirming our and consensus views on how **the year** is set to start. They are not allowing us yet to upgrade our global growth expectations (Chart on right). 

*         More ominously, the continued strong rallies in risk markets to new highs for the cycle are hiding the fact that recent hard data on Q4 activity have again forced us to lower our estimate of Q4 global GDP growth, now to 1.7%, largely due to the US and **Europe**. The average global growth pace of the past 3 months has fallen to only 1.8%, barely more than half of trend. The expectation remains that Q1 should come in at 2.4% as both **Japan** and the Euro area exit recession. 

*         While staying overall long risk markets, both credit and equities at the moment, we have increasingly focused on tactical cross-market exposures, and in particular the underweight of US equities. In GMOS **this **week****, we took profit on the overweight of Euro area equities against the US given the still very weak economy, with Q4 likely now the biggest GDP decline since the end of the global recession (We do stay overweight Euro periphery bond). But we remain aggressively overweight both **Japan** and EM **Asia** versus the US, with **Japan** currency hedged. The upside surprise on Chinese CPI **today** dented its equity market somewhat, but we think this will be temporary as it should not yet lead to monetary tightening. The recent set of strong trade and industrial data from **China** and the region are signaling to us significant upside risk on Q1 and **2013** growth projections. 

*         We have been long Japanese
