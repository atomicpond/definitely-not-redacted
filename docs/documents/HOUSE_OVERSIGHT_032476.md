So...I'm doing this Trump book for a pile of money and with so far quite a bit of cooperation from them (DT 
called me **the other day** and spent 45 minutes on the phone ranting and raving about the media--alarming). I 
wonder if you could introduce me to ****tom** barrack**--just to say I'm a journalist who you know and trust, and 
that I'll follow up with a description of the project that I'm doing. Also, I'd love a reintroduction to ****Kathy** 
Ruemmler**. I need some off-the-record perspective on ****White House**** procedures. 
Are you in **NYC** soon?
