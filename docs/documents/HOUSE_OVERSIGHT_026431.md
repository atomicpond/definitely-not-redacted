yes, and their projections and needs are way above current spreads. . At least in the states hospitals are now 
looking to sell real estate surrounding complexes. . assisted living, baby boomers. . airport 
funds starting for rebuilds. but very large. rail ports and roads also gigantic. . . no politically 
correct but profitable is alternate incarceration facilities. , always tenants:)

As previously discussed between you and Ariane, Edmond de Rothschild is deeply involved in the building 
and financing of the infrastructure in **Europe**. Edmond de Rothschild has an outstanding track record, 
history and presence in European infrastructure, as well as being one of **Europe**'s most recognized financial 
advisors to the infrastructure market. We have developed deep expertise in the infrastructure sector and 
sought secure, well-managed assets, generating stable, long-term returns for investors. 
We have done so by initiating and backing two experienced and highly-respected managers in the industry, 
TIIC and BRIDGE. TIIC is an equity investor in transport and social infrastructure. BRIDGE is an infrastructure 
debt provider. Both managers are covered in more detail below. Edmond de Rothschild has been heavily 
involved in the launch of the below funds, providing crucial support in fund structuring, due diligence, 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 026431 
capital raising, legal & compliance functions as well as the sound governance and **ESG** management across 
all funds. Partnering with TIIC and BRIDGE has enabled Edmond de Rothschild to build a strong franchise 
within infrastructure investments, complementing its overall Private Equity offering. Edmond de Rothschild 
has also acted as anchor investor for these funds, demonstrating its strong alignment of interest with these 
investment teams. With Ariane we strongly believe that we should absolutely find a way to collaborate 
together with you to think and initiate something to serve the future needs of the US in the infrastructure 
field. 
Please find attached further information on each manager. This would also be a chance for us to explore 
opportunities of working together in the future. 
Please feel free to reach out to us if you require any further information. We look forward to hearing from 
you soon. 
TIIC 
**TIIC Group** backed by Edmond de Rothschild, is a pan-European infrastructure firm advising on mid-market 
infrastructure projects across **Europe** in both the transportation and social sectors. It was established in 
**2008** by the 3 founding partners of **TIIC Group**, Jaime d'Almeida, Manuel Cary and Francisco Mendes, with 
strategic support from the Edmond de Rothschild Group and Brisa. 
The aim of **TIIC Group** is to bring an operational approach to infrastructure investments in **Europe**, drawing 
upon the extensive management and financial skills of its team members. These skills have been developed 
over **many years** at some of **Europe**'s leading infrastructure operators and project financing firms which, 
when combined with the very specific infrastructure expertise of both the Edmond de Rothschild Group 
and Brisa, makes for a powerful and differentiated investment platform. 
**TIIC Group** operates from two offices in **Lisbon** and **Paris**, providing its team with access to relevant 
investment opportunities across key target markets in **Europe** as well as to leading industrial contractors, 
operators, advisors and financiers in the infrastructure industry. 
**TIIC Group** successfully raised a First Fund with €140m of commitments targeting transportation 
investments across **Europe**. The portfolio of the First Fund comprises 6 assets located in **Portugal**, **Spain**, 
**France** and **Poland**. They represent a carefully balanced mix of greenfield and early stage brownfield 
projects in roads and car parks. **TIIC Group** has played an active role in the sourcing and development of all 
investments and has made a significant contribution to value creation. **TIIC Group** believes that this is a high
