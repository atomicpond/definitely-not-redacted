Importance: High 
I was thinking of opening with you and Bannon talking about **Trump**. Would let you sound smart and offer what 
I think would be a crowd-pleasing perspective, and make you seem like a credible player--former friend of 
**Trump**, advisor to world leaders, sought after person, etc--without having to too much rehash old stuff. 
Doesn't seem like they can win...but who knows. I'm meeting Bannon had 3 tomorrow and will stay with him 
until the end.
