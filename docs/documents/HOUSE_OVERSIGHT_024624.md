On September 14, 1964, Dean Katherine Towle announced that existing **University** regulations prohibiting 
advocacy of political causes or candidates, outside political speakers, recruitment of members, and fundraising 
by student organizations at the intersection of Bancroft and Telegraph Avenues would be "strictly enforced." 
shouldnt you write an artile 55 years later, on campus speech today. .

REMEMBERING CAVALIER MAGAZINE 
LAUNCHING A MAGAZINE 
My friend Michael Simmons, who has been the editor of **National Lampoon** and **High 
Times**, observes that Cavalier hired fine scribes. A few examples: Thomas Pynchon, Philip 
Roth, William Saroyman, **Isaac Asimov**, Theodore Sturgeon. Cavalier was launched by Fawcett 
Publications in **1952**. 
Men's magazine Cavalier (motto: "For the American Male") was published the year 
before Playboy to whom it has often been compared, and back in **the day** tried to be seen as 
slightly hipper, more youthful and considered a bit more clever than its big name rival. Almost 
an anti-establishment Playboy. A slogan stated: "Your dad bought Playboy, you 
bought Cavalier." 
I BECAME A COLUMNIST 
I was invited to write a column, named "The Naked Emperor," for Cavalier, that was beginning 
to publish underground writers and artists. They paid me $1,000 a month. My first column was 
a report on an auction of two-inch squares from the hotel bedsheets slept on by the Beatles during 
their first trip to America. 
There were 300 screaming young girls, off on a fetishist's holiday. Obviously, there wouldn't be 
enough items to go around, but it was announced that the Beatles' unwashed towels and bed 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024624 
linens were to be cut into two-inch squares and sold for $1 each. The price included a notarized 
statement of authenticity. 
My second column was about Lenny Bruce___titled "Lenny the Lawyer," since he defended 
himself in trials He was arrested for obscene performances only because there were no 
blasphemy laws. I went to the bank and deposited my check, withdrawing half of it in cash, a 
$500 bill. Lenny was alone in his hotel room on ****Christmas Day**** when I presented it to him. And, 
with a large safety pin, Lenny attached the $500 bill to the outside breast pocket of his denim 
dungaree jacket. 
AFTER JFK ASSASSINATION 
In another column of mine, "Jack Ruby and His Dirty Little Secret," it began, "**Lenny Bruce** 
told me how all the night club comics used to Jack Ruby's "tattoo of a 
lady's schmutzik (translate: pussy) in his armpit." If it wasn't a fact, I was quite willing to settle 
for an apocryphal allusion which nevertheless crystallized the entire personality of that alleged 
murderer who wanted so very much to be liked. 
I say alleged because upon Ruby's own death. **Dallas** District Attorney Henry Wade said he 
would dismiss the murder charge against him, a promise which has since been kept, although no 
such posthumous grace was ever officially bestowed on **Lee Harvey Oswald**. See, they grant you 
retroactive innocence only in the face of innumerable witnesses who were present at the actual 
event through the miracle of inadvertent televised coverage. 
Now Jack Ruby's dirty little secret has been forever sealed away in his armpit by the hymen of 
history. Oh yeah, and at Lenny's funeral, that safety pin was still attached on his jacket. 
JULES SIEGEL 
**two years** before Lenny's death, with his permission I published his obituary in my own 
magazine, The Realist. Before the issue went to press, he called his mother and a few others to 
let them know it would only be a hoax. The point was that he couldn't get work and his work 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024625 
was his life so he might as well be dead. And if people regretted that they hadn't helped him, 
well, now they could have a second chance because he was still alive. The obituary evoked 
inquiries from newspapers, wire services, foreign publications, radio and TV. 
"What's the meaning of it?" one editor asked me. "There's a lot of excitement at the city 
desk." 
"That is the meaning of it." 
**A few years later**, without my permission, Jules Siegel, the editor of a short-lived 
magazine, cheetah, published a fake obituary of me. I thought it was funny. An **Associated Press** 
reporter called, and I explained that it was a hoax. 
"Are you sure?" he asked. 
"Of course. I would tell you if I was dead." 
Siegel started writing for cavalier. His first assignment was a profile of Sterling Hayden, an 
actor best known in Dr, Stranglove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. 
Journalist Adam Ellsworth described Siegel's "Goodbye Surfing, Hello God" with his most 
famous example of rock journalism, but his most revolutionary was his article, "The Big Beat." 
It appeared in the Playboy-esque Cavalier magazine in **1965** and was one of the earliest writings
