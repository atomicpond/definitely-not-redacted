We are keen to explore the possibility of conducting an interview with Mr **Epstein**, on the subject of the stories which are circulating, 
however inaccurately, about both him and Prince Andrew, the Duke of **York**; we'd be keen to hear from Mr **Epstein** first hand so that 
the various and at times, speculative reporting which is at large in the UK press can be better scrutinised? 
Let me tell you a bit about the ****today** Programme**. 
**today** is the **BBC**'s main morning news show; we have been part of the **BBC** for **over 50 years** and are generally considered one of the 
most important news broadcast outlets - either on radio or TV - here in the UK. We set the news agenda for the **BBC** and in many 
respects we set the **daily** news agenda for the country. Our interviews are regularly re broadcast across the **BBC**'s national and 
international news network including - ****BBC** World**, ******BBC** World** Service** and ****BBC** Online**. The combination of these outlets means 
the global 'reach of a **BBC** ****today** Programme** interview is second to none. 
Programme guests have included a selection of some of the biggest names in politics, business, international relations and the arts 
including **US Treasury** Secretary **Tim Geithner**, President **Nicholas Sarkozy**, President **Hamid Karzai**, **HRH** the Prince of **Wales**, 
former President **Musharraf**, former Secretary of **State** **Condoleezza Rice**, former President Bill Clinton, Senator **george mitchell**, Al 
Gore, **Kofi Annan**, former Prime Minister **Tony Blair**, the Dalai Lama, **Bill Gates**, **George Soros**, **Stephen Hawking**, Sir Paul 
McCartney, **Mick Jaggar** and Salman Rushdie. 
We are a programme that carries considerable weight and influence and which prides itself in being a first port of call for many of the 
most important and influential figures on the international stage. 
I can best be reached via my cell phone - - or this email address. 
My very best wishes and my thanks!
