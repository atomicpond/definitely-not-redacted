To: **Lesley Groff** 
Posted 02 **August 2010** - 12:47 AM 
**Jeffrey Epstein**, Jew Billionaire Pedophile, Child Trafficker Goes Free..WoW! 20 year old Hearsay is enough to destroy catholic 
priest. What happened here to the justice system? 
**Conchita Sarnoff** 
http://www.thedailyb...hile- goes-free/ 
**Conchita Sarnoff** has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 500 companies and has produced three current events 
debate television programs, **The Americas Forum**, From Beirut to Kabul, and a segment for The Oppenheimer Report. She is writing a 
book about child trafficking in America. 
Hedge fund mogul and sex offender **Jeffrey Epstein**, who went free **this week**, lived in a depraved world of **thrice-daily** massages, 
pornographic artwork, and hush money—that's only now being revealed. **Conchita Sarnoff** follows up on her investigation of the legal 
wrangling that saved him from a long prison term and reports on the sordid details in part two of her exclusive exposé. Also: 
• **Palm Beach**'s police chief objected to Epstein's "special treatment" and gave **The Daily Beast** an exclusive look at his nine-hour 
deposition about the investigation. 
• Earlier versions of the U.S attorney's charaes. includina a sealed 53-naae indictment, could have landed Epstein in nrison for 20 years. 
• Victims  a lle creel that Epstein mn1PctPd iindPra tTP trirls from **South America**. FurnnP and the former Soviet rPnriblicc includinu three 19- 
year-old girls brought over from France as a birthday gift. 
• The victims also alleged trips out of state and abroad on Epstein's private jets, which would be evidence of sex trafficking—a much 
more serious federal crime than the state charges Epstein was convicted of. 
• Epstein's attorneys investigated members of **the **Palm Beach** Police Department**, while others ordered private investigators to follow and 
intimidate the victims' families; one even posed as a police officer. 
• Then-Attorney General **Alberto Gonzales** told **The Daily Beast** that he "would have instructed **the Justice Department** to pursue justice 
without making a political mess." 
Film director **Roman Polanski** is not the only convicted pedophile to walk free **this month** and return to a life of privilege. **On **Wednesday****, 
hedge fund manager **Jeffrey Epstein** completes his one-year house arrest in **Palm Beach**, which has been even less arduous than Polanski's 
time at a Swiss ski chalet. 
Watch **Jeffrey Epstein** Storm Out of a Deposition When Asked About His Penis 
During Epstein's term of "house arrest," he made several trips **each month** to his New York home and his private **Caribbean** island. In the 
earlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor-13 months in the **Palm Beach** Stockade—he was allowed out to his 
office each day. Meanwhile, Epstein has settled more than a dozen lawsuits brought by the underage girls who were recruited to perform 
"massages" at his **Palm Beach** mansion. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal **last week**, days before a scheduled trial; each received 
well over $1 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth. 
• **Conchita Sarnoff**: Epstein Faces Sex Traffic Probe 
• The Billionaire Pedphile's Sex Den 
With that, the known victims of Epstein's sexual compulsion have been officially silenced, and the case against him is closed unless new 
ones come forward. According to banking et-Inn-pc he ha c heen mnvina accetc niit nf the T IS and may well follow Pnlanclri intn

luxurious exile. 
But the question remains: Did Epstein's wealth and social connections—former President Bill Clinton; Prince Andrew; former Israeli 
Prime Minister **Ehud Barak**; ****New Mexico** Gov**. **Bill Richardson**; and former **Treasury Secretary Larry** Summers were just a few of the 
prominent passengers on his private jets—allow him to receive only a slap on the wrist for crimes that carry a mandatory 20-year 
sentence? Was he able, with his limitless assets and heavy-hitting lawyers—Alan Dershowitz, **Gerald Lefcourt**, **Roy Black**, **Kenneth Starr**, 
**Guy Lewis**, and Martin Weinberger among them—to escape equal justice? 
Epstein Faces Sex-Traffic Probe 
http://www.thedailyb...obref=obnetwork 
The Justice Denartment is investigating Jeffrey Enstein for child trafficking **The Daily Beast** has learned—and has widened the scone n 
its probe to include a famous modeling agency. 
Hedge-fund manager **Jeffrey Epstein** completed his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor **last week**. But it appears his problems 
may not be over. Now **The Daily Beast** has learned that: 
• Federal investigators continue to investigate Epstein's activities, to see whether there is evidence of child trafficking—a far more serious 
charge than the two in his non-prosecution agreement, the arrangement between Epstein and the Depat___Intent of Justice allowing him to
