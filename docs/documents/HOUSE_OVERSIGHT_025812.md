yes agree 
result got worse with recent negative press, clinton, as we discussed 
we were down to 1 negative (**Forbes**) before that - Christina can confirm this. 
It will get back to 1 and then 0 so long as negative things stop coming out. if new negative keeps coming out it 
really dismantles much of our effort... especially when it involves an ex-president 
no excuses here i'm not pleased with where it is at and am still working to make it happen

Hi Tyler, 
The social media sites are constantly updated: LinkedIn, **Facebook**, **Twitter**, google +. 
I'll be in touch later today re: feature article. 
Could you put a site map into the Net site.? This helps rankings. Also could you add it to google analytics 
using Jeffrey's gmail account? This allows me to monitor it's progress and index it periodically. 
I'll call you later. Thanks, 
Christina

http://jeffreyepstein.net/ - Site is live and Share This shows up when you scroll down page (look for top menu 
bar) 
I expect this to rank swiftly - I'm sending a list of all properties we need to point over in this direction with 
suggested anchor text. 
Do you have the topic right I'm doing a placement around? I'm going to have a few articles spun-off from it 
and put into lower tier publications as well. 
I want to push HARD in **August** with a premium placement, fresh link pushes, and some supporting 
placements. We should be able to get down to 1 negative by **mid-September** with a goal of being clean by end 
of year (unless new negative press comes again...) 
For social media updates... Are you currently doing these? I'd like to look at how often we are doing them and 
trying to link to our own content more often. 
I'm also exploring if we can get this new site included in Google News and maybe syndicate other important 
Al news through it... would give us free google news spots when we need them.. 
JE - There's 3 negatives today and that's 3 too many. There will be progress please continue to be patient as 
you have been. 
Best 
Tyler
