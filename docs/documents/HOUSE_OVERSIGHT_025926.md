I openly and proudly support Trump.

I've actually been able to pull people away from Hillary by saying I'd ONLY vote for Trump or Sanders. 
Citing they everyone else is establishment politics. I convinced a lesbian woman, older, to consider Trump 
after she went on a rampage about him. It just shows, people HAVE NO IDEA what they are talking about. 
Media holds the cards.... people are sheep.

» 
>> Donald Trump is a genuine phenomenon. He may or may not become the Republican nominee for 
president. He may or may not win the presidency even if he becomes the nominee. Yet it is clear that he is 
a phenomenon and that any history of the 2016 presidential race will have to spend a good bit of time 
analyzing Trump and his impact. 
» 
>> From the time he announced on ****June** 16**, Trump has dominated social and mainstream media. He 
dominates the conversation despite the lack of paid advertising. Trump says outrageous things and his 
supporters shrug it off. At every turn, his poll numbers continue
