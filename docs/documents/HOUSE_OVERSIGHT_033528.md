Is UNRWA vital for the Palestinians' future? 
A great international hue and cry followed the 
Trump administration's announcement the 
U.S. would no longer fund the UN Relief and  
Works Agency (UNWRA) because it is an 
"irredeemably flawed operation." Historically, 
**the United States** was the organization's 
biggest funder — in 2017, the U.S. covered 
nearly one-third of the agency's budget of $1.1 
billion. Angered by the Palestinians' refusal to

restart peace talks with **Israel**, however, the administration cut its 
contribution in **early 2018** from $364 million to $60 million before 
ceasing payments altogether.

How Obama Blew the Chance for Economic Peace 
by Mitchell Bard 
Iln **2009**, **Barack Obama** had an 
unprecedented opportunity to advance the 
peace process between **Israel** and the 
Palestinians. For the first time, the 
Palestinians had a prime minister who was 
respected and admired by the Israelis, 
because he did not come from the same 
terrorist background as Yasser Arafat and 
**Mahmoud Abbas**. Unlike his ideological 
comrades who insisted on "liberating **Palestine**," **Salam Fayyad**, was 
interested in building the infrastructure for a future state, 
strengthening the ****West Bank**** economy, and improving the lives of the 
Palestinian people.

Views on **Israel** of U.S. Presidential Candidates **2020**:  
**Joe **Biden****  
Former Vice President Joseph Robinette **Biden**, Jr., was born 
November 20, 1942, in Scranton, **Pennsylvania**, the first of four 
siblings. In **1953**, the **Biden** family moved from **Pennsylvania** to 
Claymont, **Delaware**. He graduated from the University of **Delaware** 
and Syracuse Law School. 
One of his first overseas visits as a senator was to **Israel**, on the eve 
of the **1973** **Yom Kippur** War during which he met GoIda Meir. "She 
read letters and told me how this young man or woman had died and 
this is their family. This went on for I don't know how long, and I guess 
she could tell I was visibly moved by this, and I was getting depressed 
about it." The Prime Minister said, "Senator, don't look so sad... .we 
have a secret weapon in our confrontation in this part of the world. 
And I thought she was about to lean over and tell me about a new 
system or something... .she said, our secret weapon, Senator, is we 
have no place else to go. We have no place else to go."
