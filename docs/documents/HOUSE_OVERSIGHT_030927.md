Subject: Sam Fields on 302 Interview 
Broward Probe: 302 Reasons Not To Talk To The **FBI** 
BY SAM FIELDS 
Guest Columnist 
Actually, there are not 302 reasons. There is but one and it is called in federal court ""The 302"". It 
could screw the innocent and the unwary.

The newspapers and Browardbeat.com make clear that the Federal investigations that led to the arrests 
of **County** Commissioner Josephus Eggleston, former Miramar Commissioner Fitzroy Salesman and 
School Board member Bev Gallagher are just beginning. 
The **FBI** will be interviewing everyone from **County** Administrator Bertha Henry to bus drivers about 
anything and everything. 
They are looking for scalps. 
I suspect that if the average person thought about it, he would assume that when the **FBI** comes calling, 
like **Joe** **Friday** from DRAGNET, they ""want the facts and nothing but the facts."" Equally important 
they want an accurate record of that interview so they bring a court reporter or at the very least a tape 
recorder. 
The average person would be wrong. 
Agents bring a pencil and pad to take notes. They then prepare a summary of the interview called a 
"302 Report." 
If you are called as a witness at trial, prior to testifying, you will be given a copy of"Your 302" to 
review. It is a record of what the **FBI** insists you said at your previous meeting. 
If your interview lasted more than thirty seconds, it is guaranteed you will find numerous discrepancies. 
Some of them will be insignificant; some of them could be material. 
Ask two people to listen to you in a discussion about a traffic accident and then write a summary. It is a 
guaranteed they will have differences with each other as well as with you, the witness. 
You said, "I am reasonably sure that the traffic light was green". 
One report takes out the equivocation and quotes you as saying: "The light was green."" 
This brings us to Federal law 18 USC 1001. That statute makes it a felony to lie to the government. And 
guess who decides whether or not you were lying? The government. 
So here is your conundrum. Do you testify about your doubts about the light, which is the truth, or do 
you adopt the "302" version to avoid the wrath of the **FBI**? 
Whether or not the "302" discrepancies are a result of stupidity or cupidity makes no difference. 
Testify in opposition to the "302" and you are in the crosshairs of the Feds. 
If they believe your testimony cost them the case, the next thing you likely to hear from the **FBI** will be: 
"Please place your hands behind your back." 
A number of **years ago**, **Fed** up with the 302 Two Step, I turned the tables on them.

**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 030928

In a high profile case, my client was asked to submit to an **FBI** interview at their offices in North Miami 
Beach. 
Feigning naivety, I asked where the court reporter was. I was told there was no court reporter. 
I then asked where the tape recorder was. 
I will always be impressed that the agent was able to give us the response he did without laughing. He 
said the **FBI** could not tape the interview because they did not have "enough money in their budget." 
It was time to play the Trump Card. 
At that point, I removed a cassette recorder from my pocket and explained that my client had been able 
to scrape together the 59 cents for a cassette tape. Further we would pay for the tape to be transcribed 
and supply them with al free copy of everything. 
You could've heard a fart in a vacuum. 
They now made it clear that no way, no how would any **FBI** interview be recorded. So we went forward 
with the interview as the agent took notes. 
Months later the client was called to testify at trial. 
I warned him the "302" would be a work of fiction. It was. I was sitting in the back of the courtroom. 
Called to the stand, he told the ""real" truth and not the "302" version of the truth. The Assistant U.S. 
Attorney was frustrated and kept on confronting him with the ""302" version. 
**Fed** up with the prosecutor and in the presence of the jury, the witness preceded to recount my debate 
over recording from the first interview. Pointing to me in the back of the courtroom, the witness 
announced that I had warned him that they would pull this crap with the "302" report. 
It didn't take t
