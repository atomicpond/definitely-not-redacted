We can also discuss single stock and Topix banks index (TPNBNK) ideas 
The Republican sweep means higher **USD** and yields are a foregone conclusion. We see **USDJPY** reaching 120 **next year** 
and Japanese reflation, bullish for Japanese equities, particularly the banks. 
• Huge focus on Banks/Financials post **Trump** election, they're the big winners. 
• The Banking sector is the main beneficiary of higher rates/less regulation overhang. 
• Investors are still underweight **Japan**. Especially in financials, so the move can have legs 
• Valuation still at depressed levels. Japanese Banks are cheap versus their peers. 
• Having said that, uncertainty still there so buying calls and call spreads makes sense. Some investors are still 
skeptical. Instead of building a large cash position, we believe options are a better play in case the market reverses and 
initiates a risk off move again. 
-BAML expects **USDJPY** 115-120 by end of **2017**. **NKY** target of 20,000 (12% upside) 
-**BoJ**'s intentions to refrain from further flattening of local yield curve positive for Banks and Insurers. 
-DXJ carries a 12% weight in banks whereas **NKY** is only 1.07% and even TPX is only 8.55%. 
-Positioning light. DXJ shares outstanding at 3year lows as foreigners have net sold $52b1n of JP equities ytd. 
-DXJ skew remains flat. 2m 25d Put /Call skew at 19%tile over **the past year**.

**Japan** Investment Strategy 
Nikkei to 20,000: Inventory cycle upturn —> cyclicals;  
inflation —> banks, insurance  
Investment Strategy 
18 November **2016** 
Key takeaways 
• Solid macro and weaker **JPY** positive for **Japan** equities, which also tend to outperform when 
US rate rises (esp. steepening) 
• The inventory cycle continues to recover on fiscal easing and capex, implying cyclical stocks 
will outperform 
• Inflation and higher yields positive for banks, insurance. Risk is diplomacy, protectionism, and 
US economic cycle 
FULL REPORT 
Bullish equities **2017**; rotation into cyclicals, banks, insurance 
We are bullish **Japan** equities for **2017** and we estimate the Nikkei 225 index will recover to 20,000 by end-
**2017** (see $/¥'s eventual surge: Buy Nikkei 06 **September **2016****). Our new Chief **Japan** Economist lzumi 
Devalier forecasts above-consensus **Japan** GDP growth and inflation in **2017**, which is also supportive of our 
bullish equities scenario (see 4.eady for ignition 18 November **2016**). We expect rotation into cyclicals, banks 
and insurance as explained below. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 014399 
1) Upturn in inventory cycle: Defensives—>Cyclicals 
We expect cyclicals to outperform defensives, premised on our end-**2017** $114 estimate of ¥120, and this is 
supported by our above-consensus economic growth outlook. Our **Japan** economist sees a shift to fiscal 
easing, firms countering the tight labor market by increasing capex, and estimates industrial production to grow 
3.5% and 3.6% in **2017** and **2018**, respectively. With the inventory cycle exiting a "contraction" phase and 
entering a "recovery" phase, conditions are likely to remain conducive to cyclicals outperforming defensives 
(Chart 1, Exhibit 3). 
2) Higher inflation, rates: Deflation stocks—>lnflation stocks
