Subject**: Re: **Trump** has discussed firing **Fed** chief after latest interest rate hike: report I TheHill 
One unusual thing about **Powell**'s appointment is that he is a lawyer, not an economist. From Yellen going back 
to **Alan Greenspan**, who started as chair in **1987**, all **Fed** chairs have held a Ph.D. in economics. Alan Blinder, 
an economist at **Princeton**, has said that a doctorate has become more or less a prerequisite of the job—without 
one, he told **Harvard Business Review**, "the **Fed**'s staff will run technical rings around you." While that remains 
to be seen, it is true that there are over 300 Ph.D. economists on the **Fed**'s staff, and **Powell** could end up 
needing to lean on their expertise more than a **Fed** chair with a doctorate in economics might.
