**President Obama** will travel to Israel and 
the occupied Palestinian territories next 
month to make an early second-term push 
for peace negotiations between two 
divided governments and to assess the 
broader political developments remaking 
**the Middle East**. 
It will be Obama's first trip as president 
to Israel, where suspicions run high in the 
aftermath of his unsuccessful early efforts 
at Middle East peacemaking. 
The choice of destination — one that 
Obama avoided in his first term — 
suggests a revival of his ambitions abroad 
after a year of virtual dormancy on 
foreign affairs. The timing also points to 
a willingness on his part to quickly 
reengage a politically volatile foreign-

policy issue just months after winning his 
second term. 
But the visit will highlight how much the  
region has changed since he last visited 
**the Middle East** in his first year in office, 
with the rise of Islamist governments and 
the widening repercussions of civil 
revolt. 
After Obama helped topple Moammar  
Gaddafi in Libya in 2011, many in the 
region wondered when he would emerge 
again to help shape the course of the 
tumultuous Arab Spring, which has 
replaced a pair of U.S.-allied 
dictatorships with elected Islamist 
governments. 
Within the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, 
much has changed since the direct peace 
talks Obama inaugurated in September  
2010 collapsed within weeks. Israel's 
recent battle with the armed Hamas 
movement in the Gaza Strip left many  
predicting a wider fight in the future, as 
divisions deepened within the Palestinian 
and Israeli electorates over whether talks 
or war would resolve the conflict. 
"To make it a substantive trip that is 
more than a positive photo-op would 
require setting up a specific framework 
for an agreement and setting a tight 
deadline to achieve it," said Jeremy Ben-
Ami, the executive director of J Street, a 
nonprofit group that advocates the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029693 
creation of a Palestinian state alongside 
Israel. 
White House officials would not provide 
a date for Obama's trip, which he will 
squeeze into the tight schedule he is 
building around a busy domestic agenda 
that includes immigration, guns and the 
economy. 
But Israeli media reported that Obama is 
scheduled to arrive March 20 as part of a 
trip that will include a stop in Jordan, 
where the civil war in next-door Syria 
and its growing refugee crisis is 
presenting a major challenge to King 
Abdullah II, a U.S. ally. 
Obama began his first term by making a 
strong push for peace talks between Israel 
and the Palestinians, believing the 
conflict fueled radicalism in the region in 
general and toward **the United States** in 
particular, given its historical support for 
the Jewish state. 
In contrast to predecessor George W. 
Bush, Obama wanted to demonstrate to 
Arab governments that **the United States** 
would make demands of Israel in pursuit 
of a regional peace agreement. 
**Israeli Prime Minister** Benjamin 
Netanyahu made little secret of his 
preference for Republican Mitt Romney  
in last year's U.S. presidential campaign. 
Netanyahu and Obama have at times 
disagreed bitterly over issues relating to 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029694 
the Palestinians, including Israel's 
continued settlement construction in the 
West Bank and East Jerusalem. 
Israel's military occupied those 
territories, along with Gaza, in the 1967 
Arab-Israeli war. Palestinians view them 
as the key territorial elements of their 
future state. 
In a June 2009 address in Cairo, a speech 
that asked for a "new beginning" with the 
Islamic world, Obama said: "The United 
States does not accept the legitimacy of 
continued Israeli settlements." He also 
did not stop in Israel on that trip, instead 
visiting Saudi Arabia, Egypt and 
Germany, where he emphasized the  
horror of
