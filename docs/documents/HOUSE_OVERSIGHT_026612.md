Do You Know This **Guy**? 
He is Edward "Ed" Mezvinsky, born January 17, 1937. And so who is 
Ed Mezvinsky? 
Well, he is a former Democrat congressman who represented **Iowa**'s 
1st congressional district in **the United States** **HOUSE** of 
Representatives for two terms, from **1973** to **1977**. 
He sat on the ****HOUSE** Judiciary Committee** that decided the fate of 
**Richard **Nixon****. 
He was outspoken saying that **Nixon** was a crook and a disgrace to 
politics and the nation and should be impeached. 
He and the **Clintons** were friends and very politically intertwined for 
**many years**. 
Ed Mezvinsky had an affair with **NBC News** reporter Marjorie Sue 
Margolies and later married her after his wife divorced him. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 026613 
In **1993**, Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, then a freshman Democrat in 
**Congress**, cast the deciding vote that got President Bill Clinton's 
controversial tax package through **the **HOUSE** of Representatives**. 
In **March 2001**, Mezvinsky was indicted and later pleaded guilty to 31 
of 69 counts of federal criminal bank fraud, mail fraud, and wire fraud. 
Ed Mezvinsky embezzled more than $10 million dollars from people 
via both a **Ponzi** scheme and the notorious Nigerian e-mail scams. 
He was found guilty and sentenced to 80 months in federal prison. 
After serving less than five years in federal prison, he was released in 
April 2008 and remains on federal probation. 
To **this day**, he still owes $9.4 million in restitution to his many 
victims. 
About now you are saying, "So what!" 
Well, this is Marc and **Chelsea** Mezvinsky. 
That's right; Ed Mezvinsky is **Chelsea** Clinton's father-in law. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 026614 
Now Marc and **Chelsea** are in their early thirties and purchased a $10.5 
million **NYC** apartment. 
Has anyone heard mention of any of this in any of the media? 
If this **Guy** was Jenna or Barbara Bush's, or better yet, Sarah Palin's 
daughter's father-in- law, the news would be an everyday headline and 
every detail would be reported over and over and over. 
And yet liberals say there are no double standards in political 
reporting. 
And people are already talking about **hillary** as our next 
President! 
And then there is possibly **Chelsea** for president in our 
future! 
The cycle never ends! 
Lying and corruption seem to make Democrat 
candidates more popular. 
WAKE UP **America**
