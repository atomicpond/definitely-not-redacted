it using miles..

Hi.. so, here is the event I am still invited to give in **Germany**. It is Oct 19th. I was previously invited to give a 
major lecture in **Heidelberg** Oct 14 but they had to cancel it after the university determination re **Australia** was 
publicized by the bitch. That air ticket, which they had paid fo, was about 5250 euros. There is a $900 
cancellation fee, and they have agreed to let me keep the ticket if I pay them 4500 euros. I offered that to the 
other place but they only have $5K USD total, which includes the $4K fee they originally offered me. I am 
going to check other tickets now, but wanted to know if you might be flying to **Europe** around then and could 
take a hitchhiker. :)

Hi **Lawrence**, 
just back from a long tour ,,on origins". 
As promised you will get my message promptly. 
As you may understand, before we start recruiting for the Festival our budget 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 029185 
implies more freedom. Now I simply do not have the flexibility to decide so easily 
on amounts in „kilos". (especially as a prominent Nobel laureate shortly before 
deadline agreed to come and implied a pretty large sum). 
What I can offer you is 5k as a lump sum. This is the ultimate at the moment. 
I deeply regret these limitations but I cannot ignore redlines. 
So please let me know if you can or cannot come. 
As ever **Jakob**

Hi.. update.. **noam** cannot do anything anyway.. nor UK that week.. So, I have been able confirm I can get the 
ticket for the discounted amount of 4500 Euros.. Are you game with my proposal? I have until end of Sept to 
buy out the old ticket before they cancel it.

Well it depends on UK.. if they can't do it, then alas, it would be the whole thing.. I could check for a discount 
ticket of course.. and maybe even economy class... There is also a small chance that I might do the event in UK 
with ****noam** Chomsky**, and I am wondering whether, if I could convince him to join me in a dialogue at your 
place whether that might change the dynamics of the event for you, and free up some more money perhaps..

Hi **Lawrence** 
your mail meets me on the way out to a week abroad. 
I need my financial colleague to decide. So, I shall be 
back at the end of this month. 
What would our share be?

Hi **Jakob**

There has been a complication. The Gottingen event had to be cancelled so that means I now do not have an air ticket to **Germany**. I 
am going to check whether I can arrange anything in the Uk which might cover part of the cost for a new ticket. In the meantime I 
thought I should let you know and ask whether it is possible to cover part or all of the cost for a ticket.
