What They Say About the Author


     	“Paul’s own writing, in particular, seemed daring and adventurous to me; it took big chances and made important arguments in relentlessly funny ways. I felt, down deep, that maybe I had some of that in me, too; that maybe I could be using my skills to better express my beliefs. The Realist was the inspiration that kept pushing me to the next level; there was no way I could continue reading it and remain the same.”
 --George Carlin

     “Paul Krassner--confidant of Lenny Bruce, co-founder of the Yippies, defiler of Disney characters, publisher of The Realist, and investigative satirist extraordinaire. As soon as we decided to create **The Huffington Post**, I knew I wanted him involved. His irreverence was just what the blog doctor ordered.”
 --Arianna Huffington

     “Thanks to Paul Krassner for continuing to be the lobster claw in the tuna casserole of modern America.”
--Tom Robbins

     “Krassner loves ironies, especially stinging ironies that nettle public figures. He would rather savor a piquant irony about a public figure than eat a bowl of fresh strawberries and ice cream.”
--Ken Kesey

     “I told Krassner one time that his writings made me hopeful. He found this an odd compliment to offer a satirist. I explained that he made supposedly serious matters seem ridiculous, and that this inspired many of his readers to decide for themselves what was ridiculous and what was not. Knowing that there were people doing that, better late than never, made me optimistic.”
--Kurt Vonnegut

     “Mr. Krassner is an expert at ferreting out hypocrisy and absurdism from the more solemn crannies of American culture.”
--**the New York Times**

     “Krassner has the uncanny ability to alter your perceptions permanently.”

                                        --**the **Los Angeles Times****

     “He has lived on the edge so long, he gets his mailed delivered there.”

                                   --San Francisco Chronicle

“Krassner lives in a world where Truth and Satire are swingers, changing partners so often you never know who belongs with whom.”

--Playboy

     “Perhaps the satire magazine that most closely resembles Charlie Hebdo in terms of inflammatory imagery was The Realist, created by Paul Krassner…”
                                                           --Time

     “Paul taught me that extreme stylistic accuracy could make even the most bizarre comedic concept credible. He is a unique character on the American landscape. A self-described ‘investigative satirist,’ he straddles the lines between politics, culture, pornography and drugs -- in other words, the land where all of us, were we really honest with ourselves, would choose to dwell.”
	--Harry Shearer

     “I have been a fan of his since I was a snot-nosed kid, and his words have been a driving force and influence on my life. If you have read his work before, you know the joys that you are in for. If you haven’t, start reading, and consider this your lucky day. For Paul Krassner is an activist, a philosopher, a lunatic and a saint, but most of all he is funny.”

                                             --Lewis Black


Many of the pieces in this collection originally appeared in The Realist, High Times, AVN, N.Y. Press, National Lampoon, The Nation, L.A. Times, Whole Earth Review, Huffington Post, Alternet, CounterPunch, and Truthdig. Several pieces have not been published before, but only for this collection.
     For George Carlin, who continues to serve as a satirical touchstone 


                         *   *   *


          “Hypocrisy is better than having no values at all.”
   --William Bennett, former education czar, 	   	   drug czar, morality czar and gambling czar

“MTV actually told us, ‘You can make fun of God because he doesn’t 
exist, but you can’t make fun of Jesus because he’s God’s son.’”

    --Vernon Chatman & John Lee,
quoted in Satiristas!
