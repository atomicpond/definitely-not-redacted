Administration officials were firm that President Obama was only beginning to think about a new 
attorney general, but many in **Washington** are already focusing on **Kathryn Ruemmler**, the former 
**White **HOUSE**** counsel, who recently returned to private practice. 
**Ms. Ruemmler**, 43, is known to be highly trusted by the president, and she helped guide his thinking on 
gay rights, the health care law and the reach of executive authority. 
She is one of only three women to serve as **White **HOUSE**** counsel. 
**Ms. Ruemmler**, who grew up in **Washington** State and studied law at **Georgetown**, also has a history of 
winning over skeptical Republicans. "You never had to question where she was coming from, and she 
never volunteered something she didn't know," said Senator Saxby Chambliss, Republican of **Georgia**. 
"She is very precise but very firm also, and held her own well." 
She also won admirers as a lead prosecutor on the **Enron** task force. But if **Ms. Ruemmler** is nominated, 
the advice she dispensed to **the **White **HOUSE****** about the I.R.S. scandal and the attacks on **Benghazi**, **Libya**, 
will certainly draw scrutiny.
