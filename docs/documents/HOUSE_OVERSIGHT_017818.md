An Epstein sex case is settled;
Dershowitz denies latest
allegation
BY JULIE K. BROWN
DECEMBER 19, 2018 8:30 PM, UPDATED DECEMBER 27, 2018 7:55 AM
Accused sex traffickers Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine **Maxwell** have settled a federal civil lawsuit
filed by a woman who says she was ordered under threat of violence to have sex with them and
other influential individuals when she was in her early 20s, sources confirmed **Wednesday**.
Sarah Ransome, who now lives in **Barcelona**, claimed that she was recruited and trafficked for
sex by the pair in **2006** and **2007** — at the same time that Epstein, a wealthy New York hedge
fund manager, was under federal investigation for molesting dozens of underage girls at his
**Palm Beach** mansion.
Women who say they were victims of sexual abuse at the hands of **Palm Beach** multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein
want a judge to throw out his lenient plea deal. AP
According to a recent court transcript, among those people Ransome claims she was directed to
have sex with was Epstein’s lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, who helped negotiate a controversial plea

deal that gave the eccentric multimillionaire — and co-conspirators employed by Epstein —
federal immunity in **2008**.
Dershowitz, 80, told **the ******Miami** **Herald******** that he has never met Ransome nor has he ever had sex
with her. He accused Ransome’s attorney, powerhouse lawyer **David Boies**, of inventing the
story and using her and another woman, Virginia Roberts, to frame him. Roberts asserted in a
federal court affidavit in **2015** that Epstein forced her to have sex with Dershowitz when she was
**16 years old**.
“I am the victim. **David Boies** and these women are the perpetrators,’’ Dershowitz said. “They
have willfully and deliberately concocted stories in order to make money — millions and
millions of dollars. And I will not rest until the entire story comes out,’’ said Dershowitz, a
professor at ****Harvard Law School**** and frequent Fox news guest commentator.
Nowhere in the court case or the transcript does Ransome or anyone else allege that Ransome
had sex with Dershowitz — only that she was directed to.
The Ransome settlement, which is confidential, comes **two weeks** after Epstein settled another
lawsuit in **Palm Beach**, filed by an attorney who represented several women who said they were
coerced into sex acts with Epstein when they were underage. As part of the settlement, Epstein,
65, issued an apology to **Fort Lauderdale** attorney **Bradley **Edwards****, admitting that he leveled
false claims in a lawsuit as part of an effort to intimidate **Edwards** into abandoning his
aggressive advocacy for the women, who are now in **their late 20s and early 30s**.
The developments follow a series of stories published by **the ******Miami** **Herald******** in late November
that detailed how state and federal prosecutors worked with Epstein’s lawyers to conceal the
extent of Epstein’s crimes, and secretly negotiated an unusual plea agreement that allowed him
to escape federal sex trafficking charges that could have sent him to prison for life. The
agreement, by design, was kept from his victims so that they could not appear at his sentencing.
**last week**, more than two dozen lawmakers in **Washington** demanded a federal investigation
into that plea deal, which was negotiated, signed and sealed by former **Miami** U.S. Attorney
Alexander Acosta, now President Donald Trump’s secretary of labor.
Acosta has not commented on the **Herald** story or on the calls
for a probe into how he handled the Epstein case.
**this week**, **a decade** after defending Epstein, Dershowitz once
again found himself in the spotlight amid the new allegations,
mentioned briefly in a court filing on Nov. 28, and first
reported on **Tuesday** by **the New York ****Daily News******.
During a Nov. 7 hearing, **Maxwell**’s lawyer, Laura Menninger,
mentioned Dershowitz’s name as among those “third parties’’
that Ransome claims she was instructed to have sex with,
according to a transcript of the hearing obtained by the **Herald**.
On **Tuesday**, after the ****Daily News**** published its story,
Dershowitz lashed out in dozens of posts on **Twitter**,
denouncing Ransome as “delusional’’ and claiming that her
lawyer, Boies, was retaliating against him because Dershowitz
had filed a bar complaint against him.
Alan Dershowitz says he has never met
the woman who alleges in a lawsuit she
was ordered to have sex with influential
men, including the famous lawyer. John

“Attorney **David Boies** threatened that unless I withdrew a bar
complaint I had filed against him for falsely accusing me of
sexual misconduct, he would find another woman to accuse me of similar misconduct. He has
