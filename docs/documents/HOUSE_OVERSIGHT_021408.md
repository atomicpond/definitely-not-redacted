I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your email. While I am running the risk that you will report my comments, if you do, either out 
of context, or incompletely, I am responding with an effort to be complete. It is hard to know how to respond to a list of false and/or 
distorted allegations, along with misleading statements on your part. I treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard to 
support and mentor students, colleagues, and members of the general public. I do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your 
reporting is to somehow argue that Universities and other institutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, then in 
fact the situation is quite the opposite. My high public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also 
opens me up to a host of outside complaints and allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which **The University** has to 
respond to. The fact that I have remained a professor in all Universities with which I have been associated, in good standing, and also 
an officer or an invited speaker at organizations like CFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that they 
trust my behavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and invited to their last 3 meetings to speak, specifically because, as 
they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally appreciated my talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time 
with the attendees. If the purpose of your report is to impugn my integrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is 
false. As noted in one of your 'miscellaneous facts', as a scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than 
allegations and innuendo. I also try and judge the facts in context. The fact that Universities and other organizations employ me or 
have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is because they value my contributions and my actions. 
The items you list are false or distorted. Item 1 refers falsely and inaccurately to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 
where we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and there were respectful 
and platonic encounters afterwards. There is nothing to comment on in item 3, which involves an anonymous 3rd party claim because I 
know nothing about it, there are no details provided, and it clearly was not taken seriously enough to result in any university 
action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because I decided I didn't want to go out to a bar with a group of attendees that I was 
harassing them? The second part did not happen. Re incident 5: The 'female companion' in this case is my wife, who can attest to the 
fact that the claim is false, which is what I wrote at the time in response to the blog in question, causing it to be taken down. 
It is worth responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021408 
Re item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came to me or wrote to me 
with questions. When she asked about advice for after graduation I DID tell her she was different than the other students in her 
year. The rest of them were interested in going on to graduate school, but she was interested in science communication so I told her 
that she might want to take a different path. Since she was the only woman in her year, as I recall, I did ask her on one of these 
occasions if that made it difficult for her in any way. I asked, because as a faculty member I was interested in knowing what we could 
do, if necessary to encourage more women to go into physics, and also because as someone she had asked for career advice from I 
wanted to know if that made a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. I have gone back over emails from that period. I have 
numerous requests from her asking me to go for coffee to talk, which I usually had to turn down because I was busy, and on several 
occasions sh specifically asked me to have coffee w
