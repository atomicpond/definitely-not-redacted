Division
• In the near term, the most likely source of a domestic shock is the fallout from one of the
investigations—by multiple state attorneys general and **the House of Representatives**—of President
Trump.
• The ebb and flow of these investigations will inevitably lead to great market volatility. But there is
greater likelihood that exogenous shocks will come from external sources, rather than domestic ones.
• External exogenous shocks

Investment
Management

“**the United States** is [sending] a message to the Iranian
regime that any attack on US interests or on those of our allies
will be met with unrelenting force. The US is not seeking war
with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond
to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps, or regular Iranian forces.”
— NSA John Bolton announcing the deployment of a carrier
strike group to **the ****Persian Gulf******, May 5, 2019
“**President Trump** has sought to put the brakes on a brewing
confrontation with Iran in **recent days**, telling the acting
defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, that he does not want to
go to war with Iran, administration officials said, while his
senior diplomats began searching for ways to defuse the
tensions.”
— **New York Times**, May 16, 2019
“Our aim is not war. Our aim is a change in the behavior of the
Iranian leadership.”
— Secretary of State Pompeo, May 12, 2019
“The Fake News Media is hurting our Country with its
fraudulent and highly inaccurate coverage of Iran. It is
scattershot, poorly sourced (made up), and DANGEROUS. At
least Iran doesn’t know what to think, which at this point may
very well be a good thing!”
— **President Trump**, May 17, 2019
