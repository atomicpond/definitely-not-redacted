• Darren Indyke [1111111111111.1111111111, 
Here are some questions. Thanks again for your help! Would love to talk to him, or travel to meet with him if that would be possible. 
-What is he chiefly focusing on now? **Is he spending more time on **The Jeffrey Epstein Science Foundation****? Could he talk about his 
interest in science and the **2011** grants/conference? 
-How has his business been affected? Is there any new direction he's taking it? Does he still have the same clients or new ones? Is it 
still at $15 billion? 
-Did he still work while in prison? How was that arranged? With whom was he working/advising? 
-Where is he spending his time now? How has his social life changed from **three years ago**? 
-Is he still close with Ghislaine Maxwell? Someone said she lives with him (but that doesn't sound right)? 
-What were friends/colleagues/acquaintances reactions to his conviction? 
-What does he think about the sentence he got- was it too lenient or too harsh and why? 
-What is his side of the story and have people been supportive? 
-Is he continuing the charity initiatives he started with Bill Clinton, etc?
