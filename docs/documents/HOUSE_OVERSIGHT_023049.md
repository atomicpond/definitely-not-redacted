civil lawsuits arose. 
A civil trial set for Dec.4 in Palm Beath

You beat yourself up mentally and

"She w. taken advantage of twice — frst by

that labeled a 14-yearrold gin as a postitute,

It would . easy to dismiss the Emicin case as

a far more troubling sior,, 
Unusual level of collaboration 
A close look at the trove of letters and emails 
contained in court racrds provides a window 
into the plea negotiations. roweling an unusual 
level of collabonuion between faleral prosecutors 
and Epstein, legal team that even gmemment
