The Fusion of Civilizations 
The Case for Global Optimism 
Foreign Affairs 
May/**June 2016** issue 
By Kishore Mahbubani and **Lawrence H. Summers** 
The mood of much of the world is grim **these days**. Turmoil in the Middle 
East, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of refugees; 
random terrorist attacks across the globe; geopolitical tensions in eastern 
Europe and Asia; the end of the commodity supercycle; slowing growth in 
China; and economic stagnation in many countries-all have combined to 
feed a deep pessimism about the present and, worse, the future. 
Historians looking back on this age from the vantage point of later 
generations, however, are likely to be puzzled by the widespread 
contemporary feelings of gloom and doom. By most objective measures of 
human well-being, the past three decades have been the best in history. 
More and more people in more and more places are enjoying better lives

than ever before. Nor is this an accident-because despite Samuel 
Huntington's foreboding, what has occurred over recent generations is not a 
clash of civilizations but a fusion of civilizations. 
To put it simply, the great world civilizations, which used to have detached 
and separate identities, now have increasingly overlapping areas of 
commonality. Most people around the world now have the same aspirations 
as the Western middle classes: they want their children to get good 
educations, land good jobs, and live happy, productive lives as members of 
stable, peaceful communities. Instead of feeling depressed, the West should 
be celebrating its phenomenal success at injecting the key elements of its 
worldview into other great civilizations. 
The march of reason, triggered in the West by the Enlightenment, is 
spreading globally, leading to the emergence of pragmatic problem-solving 
cultures in every region and making it possible to envisage the emergence of 
a stable and sustainable rules-based order. There is every reason to believe, 
moreover, that **the next few decades** can be even better for humanity than 
the last few-so long as the West does not lose confidence in its core values 
and retreat from global engagement. The greatest danger of the current 
pessimism, therefore, is that it might become a self-fulfilling prophecy, 
leading to fear and withdrawal rather than attempts to reinvigorate the 
existing global system. 
The origins of the contemporary era lie in the West's transformation during 
the **Renaissance**, the Enlightenment, and the Industrial Revolution. No 
other civilization can take credit for giving birth to modernity. This was not 
done with some benign intent to uplift humanity in general; there were 
many problems along the way, and the explosion of Western power across 
the globe had some terrible consequences for other cultures and regions. Yet 
the ultimate result was the diffusion of a modern outlook that relies on 
science and rationality to solve problems, much to the ultimate benefit of 
the planet's population. 
As recently as half a century ago, for example, there was a global clash of 
economic ideologies. Nikita Khrushchev, the former leader of the Soviet 
Union, could claim that the state was better at delivering basic goods to 
citizens than free markets were, but today such a view would be laughed at. 
The market economy has made Chinese and Indian workers today far more 
productive than they were under Mao Zedong or Jawaharlal Nehru, India's 
first prime minister. Societies now accept the simple fact that workers need 
material incentives to be productive, which has led to increased dignity and 
self-worth. The vast majority of humanity is literate, is at least somewhat 
mobile, and has access to the world's store of existing knowledge. Around 
half of the adults in the world own a smartphone, and there are now more 
connected mobile devices in total than there are people on the planet. 
The spread of science and technology, meanwhile, has also improved human 
dignity and well-being. Most people used to experience lives that were nasty,

brutish, and short. Today, life expectancy has increased by leaps and bounds 
virtually everywhere. Infant and maternal mortality have dropped sharply, 
thanks in part to the spread of clear hygiene standards and the construction 
of modern hospitals. According to the Bill & **Melinda Gates Foundation**, as 
recently as 1988, polio was rampant in 125 countries; today that number is 
down to two. Aside from among the Taliban and a few pockets of upscale 
communities in **the United States**, the virtues of vaccines are accepted by
