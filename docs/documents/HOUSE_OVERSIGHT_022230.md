Conshita is very media savy, as you are probably well aware. She knows exactly what we are doing, and is taking her 
own counter-measures, but it is constant wack-a-mole with her.

My initial estimate, given to me by Pablos, was 25, and that was based solely on his quick look at the situation, 
and not knowing what was really out there. In fact, as I have repeated many times, the job was far far worse 
that originally expected, you have a dedicated group of people trying to undo and damage you, including now, 
they have started up in **the last week** full force again, as it is obvious that they can't fux with your **Wiki** page 
any more as we blocked that.. The woman from **The ****daily** Beast****. We have programs that track this stuff, and 
so, for the past few days, Mike has been having a cyber war with her minions, who are actively trying to undo 
what we are doing, as she is trying to push her ****daily** Beast** and other articles back up. So, we have to go back 
and push them back down. 
Then, there was the issue of trying to create additionally on you a positive web presence, with the science and 
org sites. 
I spend literally **four months** of non-stop work, creativity, and my own political capital to getyou this so far, 
which saved you not only time, but countless dollars, and isn't something that can be readily bought. I had 
people working also for free. I gained access to information that standard seo companies don't have. In 
addition, I wasted a lot of time talking to people who promise to help, but end up providing nothing, and so, I 
end up having to do it myself What do I get in return, constant back slapping to my head... 
We were trying to fix up your mess. I didn't create it. Just thought it would be something to help. This was 
NEVER about trying to pull money out of you, and fact, we have don't everything possible to keep the costs 
down considerably. 
I must talk to you about the island thing asap. When can we do that?

Jeffrey, 
The hots did the sweep. Here are the new results taken as of a minute ago. You have only one negative article 
left on front page of **Google**, which is **The ****Huffington** Post**** article. **The ****Huffington** Post**** is extremely hard to 
move, because it is so powerful, has millions of links to it, and uploads massive new and original content it on 
a **daily** basis with posting from out side readers. We managed to push it down the page, as it used to be at the 
top. If we were able to post original content to both the science and the org site (absolutely not a single word 
to **this day** by Jessica, just talk), we would have been able to push it down even further, and off the page. WE 
did manage to get rid of **The ****daily** Beast**** article, which is now far removed, inspite of their own efforts to keep 
it prominent. 
Toxic suggested search engine terms that popped up automatically when you typed in your name are also now 
removed. 
Wikipedia was an important victory, as it will always be at the top of the search engine results. ow the head 
lines do not mention convicted sex offender or pedophile. Instead, **Philanthrophic** work, **Epstein Foundation**, 
**Promotion of Scientists**. We have stopped the hacking on your **Wiki** site, and that was a major effor. Your 
**Wiki** entry now is pretty tame, and bad stuff has been muted, bowlerized, and pused to the bottom. Careful 
editing and wording has muted the effect immensely. We hacked the site to replace the mug shot and caption, 
and now has an entirely different photo and caption. This was a big success. 
We pushed the **Edge** all the way up to the front page, where it was previously buried on page 5 of **Google** 
search. 
We have promoted the other jeffrey epsteins, and other pages are also filled with your material. 
And, while the sites are up, and in the direction we hoped, they are still new, and subject to volitility, 
especially if new original content is not added on a minimum of a **weekly** basis. I have been forbideen to add 
new content to the **Philanthrophic** site as well as the science site, and therefore, as a result our rating slipped 
down (still on the first page, but would have liked them (and some of the articles to been able to push 
**Huffington** off page). We also helped with you images, and the first images that come of you on a go
