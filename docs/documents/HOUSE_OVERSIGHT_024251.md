Top 10 Media Stocks for **2015** 
By Dan Moskowitz **March** 19, **2015** AAA 
Oat' 
The following list is broken down into Top-Tier Media Stocks and Speculative Media Stocks. It might surprise 
you that some of the names on the latter list aren't on the former list, but there is a simple reason for this, which 
will be revealed below. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024252 
Top-Tier Media Stocks 
Walt Disney 
The Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is one of the strongest brands in the world. It also possesses multiple revenue 
streams and pricing power. Q1 EPS jumped 23% **year** over **year** based on record revenue. When a company 
delivers record revenue, that trend doesn't make a sudden U-turn. If there's going to be a turnaround for the 
worse, it will take time to play out, giving you time to exit your position. (For related reading, see: This 
Company Is No Mickey Mouse Operation.) 
CBS 
CBS Corp.'s (CBS) Q4 revenue increased 3% and diluted EPS improved 8%. CBS also announced a $1 billion 
share buyback in **the first quarter**. This will significantly reduce the share count, which should improve 
earnings. CBS will once again have Thursday Night Football, and it will be the home of Super Bowl 50. It's 
also home to regular-season NFL games, **March** Madness and The Masters. However, its reach goes well

Comcast 
FY2014 revenue at Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) increased 6.4%. Operating cash flow and EPS improved 6.9% 
and 25%, respectively. Comcast also increased its dividend 11% and announced that $4.25 billion of its $10 
billion share buyback program would take place in **2015**. (For more, see: This Company is as Unavoidable as it 
is Unloved.) 
**twenty-first century** Fox 
**twenty-first century** Fox, Inc.'s (FOXA) Q2 operating income before depreciation and amortization increased 
12%. Fox studios enjoyed 24 ****Academy Award**** nominations in **2015**, making it the industry leader. Twenty-First 
Century Fox also recently created the **Europe**'s leading pay TV business. 
**Google** 
**Google** Inc. (GOOGL) is known as more of a technology company than a media company, but its **YouTube** 
segment consumes approximately 15% of all broadband traffic in **the United States** and **Canada** (only **Netflix**, 
Inc. (**NFLX**) is higher at 35%). **Google** also makes this list because of its $62.63 billion in cash, which means it
