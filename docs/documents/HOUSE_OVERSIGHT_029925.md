## Document Text

```
﻿For years, Ted **Kaptchuk** performed
acupuncture at a tiny clinic in **Cambridge**,
a few miles from his current
office, at the ******Harvard** Medical School****.
He opened for business in 1976, on a
street so packed with alternative healers
that it was commonly referred to as
“quack row.” **Kaptchuk** had just returned
from Asia, where, as an exiled alumnus
of the turbulent sixties, he had spent four
years honing his craft. “There were lots
of alternatives on that street in those
days, but no practitioners of Chinese
medicine,” **Kaptchuk**, who is sixty-four
and still lives in the neighborhood, told
me recently as we sipped (Chinese) tea
in the study of his house. “The area is a
little too L. L. Bean for my taste now,”
ANNALS OF **Science**
THE POWER OF NOTHING
Could studying the placebo effect change the way we think about medicine?
BY MICHAEL SPECTER
he said. “It was a different place then.”
Not long after **Kaptchuk** arrived in
Boston, he treated an Armenian woman
for chronic bronchitis. **A few weeks later**,
she showed up in his office with her husband,
who had a Persian rug slung over
his shoulder. He nodded to **Kaptchuk** and
said, “This is for you.” **Kaptchuk** accepted
the rug, which he still owns, but had no
idea what he had done to earn it. “Oh,
doctor, you have been so wonderful,” the
woman told him. “You cured me. I was
about to have an operation on my ovaries
and the pain went away the day you saw
me.” **Kaptchuk** never spoke to the woman
again, but he has been unable to get her
out of his mind. “There was no fucking
way needles or herbs did anything for that
Scientists are now seriously investigating—and debating—our response to sugar pills.
woman’s ovaries,” he told me, still looking
mystified, thirty-five years later. “It had to
be some kind of placebo, but I had never
given the idea of a placebo effect much attention.
I had great respect for shamans—
and I still do. I have always believed there
is an important component of medicine
that involves suggestion, ritual, and belief—all
ideas that make scientists scream.
Still, I asked myself, Could I have cured
her? How? I mean, what could possibly
have been the mechanism?”
At the time, few serious scientists
would have entertained such questions,
let alone allowed words like “ritual” and
“belief ” to seep into a conversation about
medicine. Placebos had a bad name,
which is not surprising, since they have
been used primarily to deceive people. In
clinical trials, if a drug and a sugar pill
produce similar results, the drug has generally
been considered worthless. But the
definition of medical treatment is changing,
and so are attitudes about placebos.
**this year**, **Harvard** created an institute
dedicated wholly to their study, the Program
in Placebo Studies and the Therapeutic
Encounter. It is based at the Beth
Israel Deaconess **Medical Center** and
**Kaptchuk** was named its director. He
has already recruited leading researchers
from around the world, in disciplines as
diverse as neuroanatomy and semiotics.
The program was formed to explore an
idea that even **twenty years ago** would
have seemed preposterous: that placebos—given
deliberately—might be deployed
in clinical practice. As medicine.
**Kaptchuk** has no shortage of critics.
They acknowledge the power of the
mind to influence health but question
the rigor of studies suggesting that placebos
could possibly prove as valuable as
drugs. Indeed, the idea of dispensing
sugar pills is jarring even to those who,
like **Kaptchuk**, are enthusiastic about it.
After all, placebos have almost always
been defined as exactly what medicine
is not. “I realized long ago that at least
some people respond even to the suggestion
of treatment,” **Kaptchuk** said.
“We know that. We have for **centuries**.
But unless we figured out how that process
worked, and unless we did it with
data that other researchers would consider
valid, nobody would pay attention
to a word we said.”
The research has been propelled in
large measure by the emerging discipline

of neuroimaging—which, like a live satellite
feed from inside the human body,
permits scientists to track precisely how
a person reacts to a drug (or a placebo) as
soon as he takes it. An injection of saline,
for example, that has been described as a
drug not only will reduce symptoms of
Parkinson’s disease but can help a patient
produce more of the dopamine that
the disease destroys. Results like those
have provided scientists with chemical
evidence of something they had long
suspected: simply believing in a treatment
can be as effective as the treatment
itself. In several recent studies, placebos
have performed as well as drugs that
Americans spend millions of dollars on
**each year**.
Transforming interesting laboratory
findings into medicine is never simple,
however, particularly when those findings
involve fake pills and sham injections.
Some people clearly respond
better to placebos than others, though
we don’t know why; some illnesses and
afflictions are more amenable to sugge
