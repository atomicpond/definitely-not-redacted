What will the fall-out be from the crisis in the eurozone? Tighter economic coordination or an increasingly detached **Germany**? We're bringing together a former French president, controversial Conservative MEP Dan Hannan and Timothy Garton Ash to debate the motion "**Germany** no longer needs **Europe** – the dream is over <http://intelligencesquared.us1.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=9b096c9e607fbd256b4fab080&id=4653697a94&e=796428630f> " on May 17th.

**Germany** no longer needs **Europe** - the dream is over <http://intelligencesquared.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9b096c9e607fbd256b4fab080&id=8113a8af92&e=796428630f>

The Germans have got what they wanted from **Europe** <http://intelligencesquared.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9b096c9e607fbd256b4fab080&id=001b48181e&e=796428630f>  – reunification – and feel increasingly disenchanted with the bargain they had to make to get it – accepting the euro. After the grudging bailout of **Greece**, the fumbled bailout of **Ireland** and all the sharp divisions exposed by the financial crisis, isn't the idea of **Europe** as a world power beginning to look like a pipe dream? Or will the euro crisis drive **Europe**'s leaders to strengthen economic policy coordination to make sure there's no repeat performance, giving a fresh impetus for the dream of **Europe**? Come and hear what a former French president and five other big hitters have to say on the issue.
