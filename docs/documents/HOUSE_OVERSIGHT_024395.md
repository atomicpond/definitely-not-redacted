THE 
CONTROL 
FACTOR 
Our Strussie to Sec the True Threat 
BILL SIEGEL 
**FrontPage Interview**'s guest today is Bill Siegel, a lawyer and business 
executive. He has been a producer of several documentary films and assists numerous non-profit organizations. 
He is the author of ****the **Control Factor****: Our Struggle** to See the True Threat. 
FP: Bill Siegel, welcome to **FrontPage Interview**. 
Congratulations on this brilliant book. It is without question one of the most vital works of our time. 
Let's begin with what inspired you to write it. 
Siegel: Thanks for having me Jamie. As a young boy born in the mid 1950s, I was fascinated with footage of 
Hitler and **the Third Reich** and could never understand how the Jews of the time could not see the evil that 
seemed so obvious. Not yet appreciative of the benefit of hindsight, I could not comprehend the blindness. 
Following 9/11, like so many others, I began to study Islam, its history, its current movements, terrorism and 
so on. As I would learn one stunning aspect after another, I would discuss them with friends and associates. 
Rather than confront the facts I would present, they would find one clever way after another to avoid the 
frightening truth of what America and the West truly face. Their fear appeared obvious to me. I began to 
catalog many of my friends' different maneuvers to dispel the anxiety that they found so difficult to endure. 
The more I focused on their mental processes (as well as my own) the more I began to see a structure to the 
mental endeavor and to understand what I had, as a child, found so difficult to explain. 
FP: Tell us about **the **Control Factor****, what you describe as "that effort our minds enga ge in in order to keep us 
blind" and that "process of a voiding seeing the threats we face." It's also about, as you state, trying to believe 
that the threat is under our control, when in fact it is not. Kindly enlighten us as to these profound insights you 
make in terms of **the **Control Factor****. 
Siegel: First, let's distinguish the "real world" where real battles are taking place from the mental battlefield 
which occurs in each of our minds. We tend to believe our perceptions are simply clear realizations of what is 
"out there" and overlook how much our internal worlds can literally determine what we see. When our internal 
minds become anxious and sense a loss of "control," they tend to concoct ways to distort our perceptions so as 
to restore that sense of inner control. I describe **the **Control Factor**** as an "active and continuous process" 
designed to maintain that sense, if not illusion, of control. We natural ly think that our thinking and feeling 
processes are passive; that they just happen. Yet when faced with truly frightening prospects, the mind is 
geared to actively distort. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024396 
Similarly, the sense of control must be continuously maintained so **the **Control Factor**** operates constantly. In 
turn, the sum of this active and continuous undertaking makes these perceptions all the more familiar and thus 
seemingly all the more "real." In one sense, **the **Control Factor**** is the mechanism of what Andy McCarthy 
entitled one of his numerous excellent books- willful blindness. **the **Control Factor**** is cleverer than we are 
aware; that is almost tautological as, if our minds are to create ways to keep us in denial, they must out 
maneuver our conscious thinking. 
Since World War II, America has had limited experience with threats coming to the homeland. Most of 
America's history has been about "over there," where we have always known that if things got too out of hand 
(e.g. Vietnam) we could always ret urn home. The current generations, for a wide array of reasons, have had 
virtually no experience with a threat to this land. (The documentary, Generation Zero, is interesting on this 
point). 
Consequently, the process of waking up to such a threat parallels the arc of a typical horror film. In such
