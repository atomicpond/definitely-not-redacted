EXCLUSIVE: Jeffrey Epstein To Be Released From Prison Early 
Jeffrey Epstein, the **Florida** money manager who once roamed in the same social circle as Bill Clinton, 
Prince Andrew and other high profile figures, is going to be released from prison early, a source tells 
RadarOnline.com. 
Epstein pleaded guilty **last year** to procuring teen girls for prostitution, ending his lifestyle with the rich 
and famous in a **Palm Beach**, **Florida** scandal that reverberated through high-profile society. He received 
an **18-month** sentence and was slated to be incarcerated until **the end of this year**. 
But now, says the source, the jail door is about to swing open because Epstein has been secretly helping 
the feds unravel a suspected **Ponzi** scheme. He had inside knowledge of the scheme because he was one 
of its victims, losing $67 million. 
The source says it's all tied to the indictment of former managers of Bear Stearns Mortgage Investment 
Fund, and in that case Epstein is the person who is identified only as Victim # 1. 
Meanwhile, Epstein's life behind bars hasn't been too rough — in fact he's allowed to spend most days at 
his attorney's office. He was supposedly working on a charity venture but the source says he was 
actually busy helping the feds with the **Ponzi** scheme. One source says that he's been guarded by men in 
suits with earphones.
