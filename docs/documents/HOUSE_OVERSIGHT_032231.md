Importance: High 
**ABC** doesn't really have an "investigative unit" so unless you want to hand it to them they won't pursue, so 
ignore. But, nevertheless, the more **Trump** looks real, or perish the thought, inevitable, the more reporters are 
going to focus on this, so, as you will not be surprised, you need a strategy.

Subject: Meet? 
Mr. **Weinberg** — 
I am a reporter with the ****ABC** News** investigative unit. We are gathering background research on the major 
candidates for President. 
Seeing that both former President **CLINTON** and Mr. **Trump** have been mentioned in connection to the **Jeffrey** 
**Epstein** case, I am interested in better understanding the case, it's current status, and any information that 
could help explain Mr. **Epstein**'s dealings and interactions with both men. 
I would very much appreciate the chance to meet and discuss this subject in an off the record conversation at 
your earliest convenience. 
Please let me know if that would be possible, and if so, when and where we could meet. 
Many thanks, 
Matthew
