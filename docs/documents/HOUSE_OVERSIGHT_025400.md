[2:56 AM] Jeffrey Epstein:
    Nyt-By age 3, Mr. Trump was earning $200,000 a year in today's dollars from his father's empire. / this is UNFAIR- what are " todays dollars? The article was written by financial illiterates

[3:06 AM] Jeffrey Epstein:
    The times did exactly the same as they accuse Donald. Wild exaggeration

[3:39 AM] Other Participant:
    Isn't it true

[3:50 AM] Jeffrey Epstein:
    What are " todays dollars: The IRS reviewed the issues . And agreed with trump. " if my grandfather would have bought one hundred dollar in treasury bills. the article to be accurate would have said when Donald was 3 years old he received 14k per year. And it doesn't say whether taxes were paid on that

[3:51 AM] Jeffrey Epstein:
    Instead it says 200k in todays dollars and when he was 8 he had a million

[4:06 AM] Jeffrey Epstein:
    Instead had Fred put 2k dollar in treassuries it would be worth 1 m today . All silly HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025402
