                    Alan Dershowitz Takes The Stand: An Autobiography

                    Or

                    Taking the Stand—an Autobiography by Alan Dershowitz

                    Preface: Ideology as Biography—A life of continuous change


My legal practice has been described as “the most fascinating on the planet.” 2   Though perhaps hyperbolic, the fact is that during my long career as a lawyer, I have:

       •  represented and counseled presidents, prime ministers, United Nations high officials, judges, senators, actors, musicians, athletes as well as ordinary people who have had the most extraordinary cases;

       •  played a role, sometimes large, sometimes small, in some of the most cataclysmic events of the last half century—from the assassination of JFK, to the forced resignation of Richard Nixon, to the Chappaquiddick investigation of Ted Kennedy, to the impeachment of President Clinton, to the war crimes trials of accused war criminals, to the defense of Israel in international fora.

This autobiography delves beneath the surface of these cases and causes.  It presents an inside account of legal events that have altered history and that continue to have a major impact on the lives of millions of people.  

What Tocqueville observed two centuries ago—that in our country nearly every great issue finds its way into the courts—is even truer today than it was then.  Accordingly, my autobiography will, in some sense, be a history of the last half century as seen through the eyes of a lawyer who was privileged to have participated in many of the most intriguing and important cases and controversies of our era.  
The law has changed considerably over the past half century.  I have not only observed and written about these changes, I have helped to bring some of them about through my litigation, my writing and my teaching.  This book presents an account of these changes and of my participation in the cases that precipitated t
