﻿**the **White House**** 
**Washington** 
February 2, 2018 
The Honorable Devin Nunes 
Chaiiman, House Permanent Select Committee on **Intelligence** 
**United States** Capitol 
**Washington**, DC 20515 
Dear Mr. Chaiiiiian: 
On January 29, 2018, the House Permanent Select Committee on **Intelligence** (hereinafter "the 
Committee") voted to disclose publicly a memorandum containing classified information 
provided to **The Committee** in connection with its oversight activities (the "Memorandum," 
which is attached to this letter). As provided by clause 11(g) of Rule X of the House of 
Representatives, **The Committee** has forwarded this Memorandum to the President based on its 
detennination that the release of the Memorandum would serve the public interest. 
The Constitution vests the President with the authority to protect national security secrets from 
disclosure. As **the **Supreme Court**** has recognized, it is the President's responsibility to classify, 
declassify, and control access to information bearing on our **Intelligence** sources and methods 
and national defense. See, e.g., Dep 't of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). In order to 
facilitate appropriate congressional oversight, **the ****Executive Branch****** may entrust classified 
information to the appropriate committees of Congress, as it has done in connection with the 
Committee's oversight activities here. **the ****Executive Branch****** does so on the assumption that the 
Committee will responsibly protect such classified information, consistent with the laws of the 
**United States**. 
**The Committee** has now determined that the release of the Memorandum would be appropriate. 
**the ****Executive Branch******, across Administrations of both parties, has worked to accommodate 
congressional requests to declassify specific materials in the public interest.1 However, public 
release of classified information by unilateral action of the Legislative Branch is extremely rare 
and raises significant separation of powers concerns. Accordingly, **The Committee**'s request to 
release the Memorandum is interpreted as a request for declassification pursuant to the 
President's authority. 
The President understands that the protection of our national security represents his highest 
obligation. Accordingly, he has directed lawyers and national security staff to assess the 
See, e.g., S. Rept. 114-8 at 12 (Administration of **Barack Obama**) ("On April 3, 2014. . . **The Committee** agreed to 
send the revised Findings and Conclusions, and the updated **Executive Summary** of **The Committee** Study, to the 
President for declassification and public release."); H. Rept. 107-792 (Administration of **George W. Bush**) (similar); 
E.O. 12812 (Administration of **George H.W. Bush**) (noting Senate resolution requesting that President provide for 
declassification of certain information via Executive Order). 
declassification request, consistent with established standards governing the handling of 
classified information, including those under Section 3.1(d) of Executive Order 13526. Those 
standards permit declassification when the public interest in disclosure outweighs any need to 
protect the information. **the **White House**** review process also included input from the Office of 
the Director of National **Intelligence** and **the Department of Justice**. Consistent with this review 
and these standards, the President has determined that declassification of the Memorandum is 
appropriate. 
Based on this assessment and in light of the significant public interest in the memorandum, the 
President has authorized the declassification of the Memorandum. To be clear, the 
Memorandum reflects the judgments of its congressional authors. The President understands 
that oversight concerning matters related to the Memorandum may be continuing. Though the 
circumstances leading to the declassification through this process are extraordinary, the 
****Executive Branch**** stands ready to work with Congress to accommodate oversight requests 
consistent with applicable standards and processes, including the need to protect **Intelligence** 
sources and methods. 
Sincerely, 
Donald F. McGahn II

Committee's ongoing investigation into **the Department of Justice** (DOJ) and **Federal Bureau** of 
Investigation (FBI) and their use of the **Foreign **Intelligence** Surveillance** Act (FISA) during the 
2016 presidential election cycle. Our findings, which are detailed below, 1) raise concerns with 
the legitimacy and legality of certain DOJ and FBI intera
