﻿Dear ****Harvard** Business School**,
I am extremely excited to share my application with you. For **years** now it has been my dream to attend your
MBA program, studying amongst the world’s best professors and most achieved students to earn the education
that will influence the rest of my career and the future of my company. To explain how much I also
hope to contribute at **Harvard**, I would like to tell you three stories that characterize who I am.
My first story is about family.
A small-town Italian from a modest family, my father worked locally as an industrial designer after high school,
but he always wanted to be an entrepreneur. Thirty-four **years** ago, at the age of 22, as soon as he saw a
market opportunity, he quit his job (defying his parents), linked his talents for design and sports, and handbuilt
his first piece of gym equipment in his garage; that was the beginning of **Technogym**. By the time I arrived,
seven **years** later, **Technogym** had earned a respected place in the international market. Nine **years** later,
when my younger brother was born, it was the world-leading and most innovative manufacturer of fitness
equipment, digital wellness solutions and rehabilitation systems. It now has **annual** revenues of over 555m€
and 35 million **daily** users in over 100 countries. My father directs some 2,000 staff as CEO and Chairman.
Thousands of talented people have contributed to **Technogym**, among them my mother, my brother, and I.
**Technogym** has been like my older sibling, and has always been the main topic of conversation at dinner. We
plan our vacations around it and have supported one another through its ups and downs. We have all made
sacrifices – but gladly, as one always does for family.
My father’s vision to bring “wellness” to people around the world inspired me to get involved at a very young
age, so many of my childhood memories involve weekends at the office with my dad. These early experiences
embedded in me the entrepreneurial values that make my father such a successful person, values such as
taking calculated risks and investing in innovation. I have attended countless meetings at his side and worn a
company T-shirt at every Olympics from **Athens** **2004** to Rio **2016**, as **Technogym** has been the games’ official
supplier since **2000**.
Growing up in a family business has given me access to a vast network of people and I have sought to learn
as much as I could from inspiring people like Richard Branson and Marc Benioff; however, the person I admire
the most is my mother, who put aside her own education and career to commit to our family and company.
She’s been at my father’s side since she was 16. Women have played a huge role in business and society,
and I want to do my part to further opportunities for women, joining the long legacy of leaders who proudly
call themselves **Harvard** alumnae. I intend to participate in the Women’s Student Association to become one
of the voices that carries this power beyond the campus. A **Harvard** education will help me develop the vision,
leadership and credibility that I will need throughout my career, and in furthering great causes that mean a lot
to me.
Next, I'd like to talk about commitment.
I understood early that I would always participate with my father's legacy and lead **Technogym**. I committed
myself to learning languages at school, becoming a good teammate and competitor through sports, and
spending my university holidays exploring different industries through internships. Yet I still wanted to set my
own career and earn my own credibility. Whether conducting analyses at **JP Morgan** in **Paris**, selling highpriced
artwork in ****Mexico City****, or developing marketing campaigns for iconic brands like Bulgari and
Tifany&Co., I have built my own identity thanks to working alongside diverse, accomplished people. By
adapting to different countries, cultures and industries, I have adopted new ways of thinking, working, and
even speaking while also asserting myself and learning to make measurable contributions quickly.
My most impactful experience was volunteering for a UN’s World Food Program microfinance initiative in El
Salvador, one of the world's poorest and most dangerous countries. I helped design and develop “Fondo
para Agricultura,” an investment fund supporting 75,000 small farmers. There, I was warned not to walk
alone or explore the city, but I have never seen such warm and generous people as the Salvadorans. I made
lifelong friends with my colleagues and many locals, and I witnessed how even small efforts can impact the
lives of many. I became active in our company’s foundation to spread goodwill in my own community.
Since **2009**, **Technogym** has been an invitee of the World Economic Forum in **Davos** as the ‘wellness industry
shaper’, a true honour for a company of its size. Accompanying my father to the **annual** Meetings, I have
heard inspiring leaders talk about making the world a better place. As a ‘Next Gen' myself, I joined the Family
Business Community. There I discovered impact investing,
