****the year** ahead**: A World of Change 
A continued rise in equities. Renewed investor confidence. Bond markets under 
pressure. Our Chief Investment Office explores the risks and opportunities of 
these and other trends shaping ****the year** ahead**. 
AS WE 
LOOK 
BACK ON 
**2016**, one 
could 
characterize 
it as The 
Year of The 
Unlikely. It began with deep worries regarding **China**'s growth path, a second wave of collapsing 
oil prices, a ****Federal Reserve**** (**Fed**) hiking into deflationary headwinds, the impact of negative 
interest rates in **Europe** and **Japan**, concerns over a potential U.S. recession, lower-quality corporate 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 014525 
high yield problems, and U.S. consumers who might never spend their savings at the pump. All 
these worries hit at once in **January** and **February**, prompting the S&P 500 to fall over 10% from its 
**2015** closing level of 2043. **the year**, at that point, appeared bleak. 
Our view was to maintain a balanced and diversified position throughout the downturn, particularly 
for the long haul, due to our belief that the major concerns, although understandable, were simply 
not going to fully develop and asset prices would begin to track fundamentals more effectively 
through the remainder of **the year**. The potential for risk assets to climb higher was there but a 
catalyst was needed. For our full view on ****the year** ahead**, please read our **December **2016**** **monthly**  
Letter.

Past performance is no guarantee offuture results. 
Our core belief was centered on healthy consumers who would indeed pick up their spending from 
savings at the pump and become more confident as job growth continued and real incomes 
increased. We also believed U.S. financial conditions and the economic backdrop would improve in 
the second half of **the year** as the pressure from the strong dollar subsided and the deflationary 
effects of the collapse in oil prices began to fade. In other words, we were witnessing evidence that 
the mid-cycle slowdown that had hurt economic growth and corporate earnings was ending. [See 
Exhibit 1] Based on this core belief, the "grind it out" year for risk assets would be back on track, 
the business cycle would extend into **2017**, bond yields would slowly shift higher, and equity 
markets had the potential to head toward previous highs. 
A series of unexpected outcomes 
At this point, we did not characterize **2016** as **the year** of the Unlikely. However, if you consider 
specific events throughout **the year** in finance and sports, it is easy to see that now. We already 
mentioned the second plunge in oil prices to the mid-$20s per barrel to start **the year**, and bond 
markets in some areas of the world actually had negative yields—meaning the lender paid the 
entity issuing the bonds to take their money! This was unlikely. How about Brexit vote in Great 
**Britain**? Unlikely. In sports, Villanova University winning the national championship in men's 
college basketball (**Nova**'s first championship since **1985**), Leicester—the English football club—
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 014526 
winning the Premier League (before **this season** began, British bookmakers listed them as a 5,000-
to-1 shot to emerge as the champion), the Cleveland Cavaliers' first ever National Basketball 
Association championship and, of course, the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series for the first 
time since 1908! All unlikely. But they happened. 
Last but not least, in our own political backyard, we witnessed Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. 
presidential election **last month**. Also unlikely. We all know markets do not like uncertainty. 
However, sentiment can shift quickly if fundamentals are not negatively affected, and what was 
previously determined to be "unlikely" turns to enthusiasm as to what could be. 
"We expect business, consumer and investor confidence to continue to head 
higher well into **2017**, with most of the newly expected growth to come in **2018**, 
which should underpin equities for most of **the year**." 
CHRISTOPHER HYZY 
CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BANK OF AMERICA GLOBAL WEALTH AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT 
Why this expansion can continue 
Business cycles typically last between five and seven years before fundamentals deteriorate, 
usually due to a policy error of some sort. This can produce a recession and/or a bear
