**Texas** Billionaire's Heirs Save Some Money on 
Taxes

Every so often I hear a story that I find rather wonderful, and that I then pass along to you, just in case you and I 
share a similar sense of wonder. Here is one of those stories. It's about death and taxes. 
The story begins on Dec. 28 of last year, when a **Dallas** billionaire named Harold Simmons died at the age of 
82. He left the bulk of his $8 billion fortune to two of his daughters. Much of that fortune was in "Contran 
Corp., a closely held entity that holds majority stakes in four publicly traded companies: Valhi Inc., NL 
Industries Inc., Kronos Worldwide Inc. and CompX International Inc." 
The biggest chunk of the estate was Contran's 93.8 percent stake in Valhi, which was 318,156,746 shares.' 
Valhi's stock closed on Dec. 27, **2013**, at $14.91 per share, making that stake worth about $4.7 billion as of 
Simmons's death. Another 2,481,900 Valhi shares (0.7 percent, $37 million) were held by the Harold Simmons 
**Foundation**, a charity controlled by Simmons's daughters.2 Other family members owned about 2.8 million 
shares ($41 million). Public shareholders owned about 15.7 million shares ($234 million).3 
Here are two facts about the federal estate tax: 
• The estate tax rate for **2013** and **2014** is 40 percent of the value of the estate. 
• The executor can choose to determine the value of the estate either on the date of death, or on the 
"alternate valuation date," which is the date **six months** after the date of death.5 
For Harold Simmons's estate, that alternate valuation date is **tomorrow** -- **six months** from his death. **today** is 
the last trading day before that valuation. How's Valhi done in **the last **six months****?

Oh.6 The stock closed **yesterday** at $6.01, reducing the value of the estate's holdings by $2.8 billion -- and its 
estate-tax liability by $1.1 billion -- since Simmons's death. 
Is that good news or bad news for the estate? Well, the first law of tax is that it is always better to have more 
money than less money.' It's not actually a good idea to lose $2.8 billion of money to save $1.1 billion in taxes. 
Though the estate didn't exactly lose $2.8 billion of money. That tax liability is a cash expense: You've actually 
got to write a check to the IRS for $1.9 billion (using the **December** valuation) or $765 million (using 
**yesterday**'s valuation), so the $1.1 billion you save is an actual cash savings. The $2.8 billion loss, on the other 
hand, is a paper loss. Perhaps it's just temporary. If there were some reason to think that it didn't reflect only a 
decline in the fundamental value of Valhi, you might not worry as much about that paper loss as you would 
about the cash taxes. 
So what's happened to Valhi? Well, it's not having a great year, with zero-ish net income **last quarter**. The board 
reduced the dividend by 60 percent, to its lowest level since **2005**. And the few people who follow the stock are 
unimpressed. ****Bloomberg**** shows two analysts following Valhi, **Barclays** and EVA Dimensions. They both have 
sell ratings, and **Barclays** has a price target of $5.00, saying in May that "from a SOTP analysis, we continue to 
view VHI as trading above its intrinsic value." A Seeking Alpha piece from **a few weeks ago** is similarly 
gloomy, with a $6 per share fair value. 
All of this suggests that Simmons's estate owes less tax because it's really worth less than it was **six months** ago. 
In fact, if you taxed Simmons's heirs now based on the value of Valhi **six months** ago, they'd have almost 
nothing left of their stock. 
But there's one more bit of the story. On June 11, about **two weeks** ago, the Harold Simmons **Foundation** -- the 
charitable **Foundation** controlled by Simmons's heirs -- filed with the SEC a plan to sell all of its 2.5 million 
shares. That's not a lot of stock, exactly -- just 0.7 percent of the company, worth around $16 million at the time 
of the filing -- but it is a lot relative to the usual volume of trading in Valhi. Remember, 93.8 percent of Valhi is 
owned by Simmons's heirs and never trades. Between **December** 27, **2013**, and June 10, **2014**, Valhi traded an 
average of 42,311 shares a day, so the **Foundation**'s shares represented almost 59 days' volume. 
It sold them in 11 days:
