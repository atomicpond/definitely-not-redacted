Subject: Re: A tax loophole for just **Jeffrey Epstein**? 
Importance: High 
**Comey** himself acknowledged that: "throughout history, some presidents have decided that because 'problems' 
come from **Justice**, they should try to hold the **Department** close. But blurring those boundaries ultimately 
makes the problems worse by undermining public trust in the institutions and their work." **Comey** has also 
acknowledged that the president had the constitutional authority to fire him for any or no cause. 
**President **Trump**** also had the constitutional authority to order **Comey** to end the investigation of former national 
security adviser **Mike **flynn****. He could have pardoned **flynn**, as **Bush** pardoned Weinberger, thus ending the 
**flynn** investigation, as **Bush** ended the Iran-Contra investigation. What **Trump** could not do is what **Nixon** did: 
direct his aides to lie to the **FBI**, or commit other independent crimes. There is no evidence that **Trump** did that.
