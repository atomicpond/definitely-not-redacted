**the Tax Cuts and **Jobs Act**** (the "**Tax Act**"), which was signed into law by **President Trump** on December 
22, **2017**, contains the most sweeping federal tax law changes since **1986**. Most provisions of the Tax 
Act take effect for taxable **years** beginning on or after January 1, **2018**. This Client Alert is not intended 
to be a comprehensive review of this massive legislation. The Alert focuses on certain provisions of 
the **Tax Act** that may have the most significant impact on asset management firms, their owners, their 
investment vehicles, and the investors in such funds. Certain changes made by the **Tax Act** are 
permanent but many others are scheduled to expire after **2025** unless extended by further 
Congressional legislation. 
I. Carried Interest Survives in Modified Form 
The **Tax Act** contains changes to the treatment of "carried interests", but such changes are not as 
negative as the prior legislative changes that had been proposed but never adopted. The granting of a 
"future profits only" interest in a partnership in connection with the performances of services to the 
partnership continues to be eligible for tax-free treatment under the new law. For certain owners of 
"Applicable Partnership Interests" (of the sort that would generally be issued by an investment 
partnership to the general partner), the Act applies a **three-year** holding period requirement for capital 
gains derived by the partnership (or from the disposition of the profits interest) to be eligible for the 
long-term capital gains tax rate (instead of the generally applicable one-year holding threshold). 
The change in carried interest taxation clearly impacts managers of hedge funds more than managers 
of private equity funds or real estate funds, which typically have a longer than **three-year** holding period 
for investments in their portfolio companies or real estate assets. The new tax treatment applies to 
income realized in tax **years** beginning on or after January 1, **2018** and existing carried interests are not 
grandfathered. Thus, it appears that any unrealized capital gains which have already been allocated to 
a general partner on the books of the partnership would be subject to the new tax treatment at the time 
the partnership realizes such gains in **2018** or subsequent **years**. 
Note, however, that the **Tax Act** does not change the current federal income tax treatment of carried 
interest allocations of "qualified dividends" to individuals, which are also taxed at long-term capital gains 
rates. The capital gains from the carried interest that fail to satisfy the new **three-year** holding period 
requirement are treated as "short-term capital gains" which are taxable at ordinary income rates. 
The "Applicable Partnership Interest" held by the general partner or an affiliate should not include any 
portion of the partnership interest that is attributable to capital contributed to the partnership by the 
general partner. The exact manner on how such exception will apply will need to be addressed in future 
**IRS** notices or regulations to be issued. Limited partners holding capital interests in private investment 
funds are also not affected and therefore retain the one-year holding period requirement for long-term 
capital gain treatment. 
Note also that the term "Applicable Partnership Interest" does not include an interest held directly or 
indirectly by a corporation and it currently appears that such exception includes holdings by both C 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 026779 
corporations and S corporations. It is likely that further guidance will be issued on this question, as it 
may be advantageous for certain general partners to convert their existing entities that hold the carried 
interest to S corporations, and such general partners may have until March 15, **2018** to accomplish such 
conversion. 
Managers of hedge funds and other partnerships that do not hold capital assets for more than three 
**years** before their sale may consider whether the carried interest incentive allocation should be replaced 
with an incentive fee structure. Also, the reduced after-tax value of a carried interest partnership 
allocation may impact the management company's executive compensation arrangements.
