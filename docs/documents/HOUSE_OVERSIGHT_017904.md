Synopsis
Background: Representatives, survivors, and insurance carriers of victims of ****September 11**, 2001** terrorist attacks brought actions against terrorist organization responsible for the attacks and its members and associates, alleged state sponsors of terrorism, and individuals and entities who allegedly provided support to the terrorist organization, asserting causes of action under Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA), Antiterrorism Act (ATA), Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA), and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), as well as claims under New York law for aiding and abetting, conspiracy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, survival, wrongful death, trespass, and assault and battery.

[2] chairman of SHC and Saudi Minister of Interior were entitled to immunity under discretionary function exception to FSIA;
 
[3] two Saudi officials did not have such minimum contacts with **the **United States**** as to support a finding of general personal jurisdiction;
 
[4] complaint alleging that various Islamic charities and organizations provided support for September 11th attacks, failed to state a claim under TVPA;
 
[5] allegation that defendant provided a satellite phone battery to terrorist leader sufficiently stated a claim under ATA; and
 
[6] absent any allegation that defendant had any role in directing an enterprise, allegation that he funneled money to terrorist organization through the charities with which he was involved failed to state a claim under RICO.
