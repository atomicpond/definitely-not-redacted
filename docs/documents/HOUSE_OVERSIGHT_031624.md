most of the saudi money is tied up in pe funds. no withdrawals allowed. and im not seeing much in the 
secondary market. . **BLACKROCK** is more money market, more like custodian than investor.

Interesting. CEO of big finance form told me that Saudis (**SAMA**) have withdrawn $200 billion that 
has been parked with usual suspects **over past year** or so. That number seem in line with what you 
know?

words that you to refer to one thing, **USA**. the stock market / the **Royal** family, . are no longer very 
useful. In politics the **USA** meant **the White **HOUSE****. now there is **Pentagon**. **CIA**, state, and **Congress** in 
addition, each feels empowered to act more independantly. stock market even in tech, needs bio 
tech, **consuner tech**. **infrastrucrue tech**. etc. same with **Royal** family, there are 20k members of a 
tribe, called the **Royal** family, the words are misleading. if your article is focused on **bin salman**, or 
the very top. no one is wondering where they can find the local costco.. but they are aware that a 
message needs to be sent to their population , regarding **the next 20 years**, 
social media, and the selfie crowds post the best of everything, their cutest pictures the amazing 
food , the luxury resorts. the masses see these things and as the difference between expectations and 
reality widen, the anger grows. trump has tapped in. 
with the passage of the 9 11 saudi bill, unlike the french revolution where it was the people of **France** 
that revolted against their own aristocracty, with the internet and globalization of discontect it is now the 
americans that can revolt against the saudi leadership. it is the americans that are demanding women 
drive, not the saudis

I have been called in to help on a big **NYT** investigation into how low oil prices have been 
effecting the personal finances of **Royal** family in **Saudi Arabia**. Obviously they called in much of 
their cash from the likes of **BLACKROCK** and others but I thought you might have some ideas. 
Maybe some people to talk to? 
I would think its more than cutting down on yachts and private planes or selling real estate in 
**Paris**, **Istanbul**, **London**. 
Any thoughts? 
PS: does my story on **Abraaj** get me a meeting with **Gates** next time he is in town:)
