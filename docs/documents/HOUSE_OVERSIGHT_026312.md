**Steve Bannon** trying to get on disgraced 
******Jeffrey** ****Epstein******'s** good side 
By Emily Smith 
**Steve Bannon** shared a secret meeting with reviled billionaire pedophile **Jeffrey** -****Epstein**** at the 
financier's notorious **Upper East Side** mansion. 
**Former **White **HOUSE****** chief strategist Bannon was spotted stepping out of his SUV and entering 
the registered sex offender's sprawling 21,000-square-foot mansion at 9 E. 71st St. shortly 
before 7 a.m. **Wednesday**. 
****Epstein****'s -palatial pad is one of his homes where young_girls were allegedly brought in to 
perform massages and used as "sex slaves." 
We assume Bannon wasn't there for a massage. 
Sources speculate that the disgraced -****Epstein**** wants to use his millions to work his way close to 
political power again. 
One told us, "Bannon needs money to bankroll his political agenda. ****Epstein**** has plenty of 
money, and craves power and access." 
Bannon made an early-**Morning** beeline to ****Epstein****, even though Bannon may have burned 
bridges when he savaged ****ivanka** **Trump**** over her criticism of Roy Moore, whom Bannon 
backed despite claims the candidate had sexually harassed teens. Citing an allegation in -legal 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 026312 
papers from a woman (who later dropped her lawsuit) that Donald **Trump** and ****Epstein**** had 
raped her when she was 13, Bannon said in response to **ivanka**, "What about the allegations 
about her dad and that **13-year-old**?" 
****Epstein**** has previously used his millions to cultivate the world's most powerful___but has 
mostly given money to Democrats. 
From 2001 to 2003, Bill Clinton flew on ****Epstein****'s private plane, dubbed "The Lolita Express," 
26 times. ****Epstein**** is close to Prince Andrew and was a regular at **Trump**'s Mar-a-Lago. 
**Trump** told **New York** magazine of ****Epstein**** in **2002**, "Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. 
It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the 
younger side." 
****Epstein****, 65, pleaded guilty in **2008** to soliciting prostitution from a teen and served **13 months** 
in jail. 
**last year**, he reportedly paid millions to settle three lawsuits filed against him by teens. 
Bannon's rep didn't comment. A lawyer for ****Epstein**** said, "Let me ask him," but didn't respond 
by deadline.
