Subject**: Buy hedges for May expiry 
Attachments: image001.jpg; Woo - Cause and Effect - 13-Feb-2017.pdf; Woo - **Year Ahead** - 16-Nov-**2016**.pdf 
Importance: High 
David Woo (BAML head of FX, Rates and EM Strategy, very highly regarded across our client base) is back from meetings 
in DC with senior policymakers. 
Bottom line: sees market pullback over the next 6-8 weeks on near term policy disappointment and recommends 
buying protection such as S&P puts — very cheap and market is priced for perfection right now. 
May 
expiry 100%/90% SPX put spread costs 1.7% (6:1 gross max payout) 
David Woo takeaways 
• #1 focus **these days** is tax reform - if they don't get it done by Jan 2018, it won't happen at all, and then 
Republicans would be out of a job when midterm elections come 
• ACA has to be completed first — and it was a mistake to tackle this before tax reform. **Obamacare** difficult with 
only 52 seats in the **Senate** but Ryan has gone too far to back away from ACA and refocus on tax reform as a priority. 
McConnell's ACA target is mid-April and then they can start to focus on tax reform 2H April at the earliest. 
• Position for a market pullback over the next 6-8 weeks on bad headlines, data rollover (consumer confidence) 
as market focuses on ACA, low approval ratings and lack of progress with tax reform — 
buy early- or **mid-May** expiries 
vol and SPX puts are cheap — 
• Still long term bullish 
• 95% tax reform still happens **this year** (2H17 or Jan 2018) because Republicans know it has to happen **this year** 
or they are sitting ducks in 2018 and potentially unelectable for **6 years** 
• Predicts no progress on tax reform over the next 6 weeks and then Republicans rally together to get behind a 
new plan and get it done (enter Woo's VAT proposal) — with market messy in the meantime 
• **Trump** is obsessed with the stock market — when he sees it trade lower, he will act 
• Regarding valuation adjustment tax (VAT) vs. border adjustment tax, Woo favors a 5% VAT over BAT 
o Why there is a <10% chance current proposal of BAT will get passed 
• **Paul Ryan**/Keven Brandy's proposal implies USD will appreciate +25%. Ryan is telling retailers this will happen 
but this is completely unrealistic and has serious consequences. Why this cannot happen: 
• $20tn in non-USD assets owned by US households - $5tn hit on country's balance sheet 
• EM has —$4tn in USD-denominated debt — increase of $1tn in EM debt and hurts US investors ultimately 
• —30% corporate profits are overseas ($400bn — so $100bn hit to [PS) — even exporters get hit — 
counterproductive 
• Commodity prices are in USD — hits purchasing power of rest of world in commodities — would see oil in the mid-
$30s — hits **Russia**, **Brazil**, even **Exxon** 
• 60% of central bank reserves are in USD — this would go above 70% - would foreign CBs want to hold this much 
when the US economy is 25% of global GDP? Yields would need to increase 
o BAT could get hung up with WTO (3-**4 years**.) Under BAT, wages are deductible (imported goods taxed as a share 
of total value but domestic goods taxed on only profits) — trade partners like **Canada**, **Japan** would take this to the WTO 
and we would wait **4 years** for a verdict 
o 5% VAT is WTO compliant and has several benefits 
• VAT levels playing field for US imported vs exported goods (no longer see BMW's cheaper in the US than 
**Germany**) 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 014717 
• VAT is revenue neutral — would raise enough revenue to cut corporate tax rate to 15%, even 10% possibly 
• While consumption taxes like VAT can hit the poor (Democrats hate them), there is room for carve-outs on 
groceries, etc. There will be pushback from Republicans who hate lack of visibility of VAT as well. Only person who can 
pass this is **Trump**. 
• Under BAT, the working class is arguably hit even worse than under VAT 
o BAT would cause prices to go up at WMT and TGT (most of **Trump**'s supporters shop there) 
o Retailers would raise prices but exporters won't lower prices 
o 5% VAT will result in a smaller average rise in prices (not entirely passed through), so less disruptive — would 
need USD to strengthen only 3-4% 
• Where does this leave us? Only **Trump** can cut through the logjam. 
• Woo prefers **Europe** over US right now. European equities are climbing a wall of worry 
• Getting positive on energy 
• Buy the dip in May (-6 weeks). But own early-May or **mid-May** equity puts now. 
• Other anecdotes 
o Regardless of your political preference, he thinks we all need **Trump** to succeed or the economy will get Bernie 
Sanders or worse. 
o Tillerson vs Kerry — Woo thinks Tillerson is actually working and getting things done, as opposed to Kerry who 
just cared about the Nobel. 
• Thus sees zero risk of a trade war with **China** 
• **NAFTA** is really more about **China**, not **Mexico** - and will ultimately benefit **Mexico**. Renegotiating **NAFTA** will 
remove the ability for Chinese exports to come in tariff-free thro
