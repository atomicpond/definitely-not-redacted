﻿Global Equity Volatility Insights
Why S&P vol dispersion may be the best
way to trade a bubble in Tech

US
How to detect and position for a potential Tech Bubble
Our investment strategists recently warned against the risk of an overshoot in US Tech,
as data on valuations, relative performance, and inflows invoke echoes of the late ‘90s.
However, rising Tech vol alongside rising Tech stock prices – a classic sign of an asset
bubble – has yet to materialize, suggesting still early stages of bubble formation.
Derivatives can be a key tool for trading bubbles, allowing investors to capture asset
price upside while mitigating reversal risk. To this end, we like stock replacing FANG
positions or overlaying Tech exposure with Nasdaq 100 (NDX) put spreads. Long
volatility dispersion strategies are particularly well-suited for trading asset bubbles, in
our view, as they can profit from both the inflation and deflation of a bubble without
needing to time the top. Specifically, we like SPX 12M Top50 dispersion to position for
a potential Tech Bubble as (i) the Top50 basket is dominated by Tech stocks, hence
would benefit from any rise in their vol from currently low levels; (ii) the trade would
benefit from any downward pressure on broad-market correlations as Tech stocks
decouple from other large caps; and (iii) the late ‘90s Tech Bubble generated the most
sustained period of elevated S&P vol dispersion in history.
Europe
DTE Sep17 collars can hedge DTE-TMUS merger risk; value in Enel bullish riskies
DTE GY has run too fast, too quick: investors who own stock should consider hedging a
pullback using a Sep17 collar (+17put/-18 call for 46bps) to hedge losses greater than
2.9% while retaining upside to 18 (stock’s ~15yr high is 18.05). Extending our EU equity
vs credit theme to single names, we find Enel 3m bullish risk reversals screen attractive
as Enel’s projected 12m div yield is high versus Enel CDS (suggesting value in owning
equity vs credit) and the price of 3M bullish risk reversals is low (versus other names) as
well as versus history (2 nd 5y percentile).
Asia
Buy best-of puts to cheaply hedge a reversal in the melt-up rally
While still high central bank liquidity may continue to push markets higher, heavy equity
and option positioning suggests the risk of a market reversal. To minimize the cost of
hedges and take advantage of the recent decline in volatility and correlation, we suggest
owning 14-Sep-2017 95% strike best-of puts on KOSPI2/HSI/NKY at 0.8%, a 45%
discount to average vanilla puts.
