DIRECT EXAMINATION
BY MR. SIMPSON:
Q. Good morning or good afternoon, I guess?
A. Afternoon, yes.
Q. If I ask any questions today that you can't
understand, would you please let me know and I'll
attempt to rephrase or clarify it?
A. Sure.
Q. You're a former **United States** District Judge;
is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. When were you a judge?
A. From about 2002 'til about November 2007.
Q. Okay. So you were appointed by the first
**President Bush**?
A. Yes.
Q. Uh, second **President Bush**?
A. Second **President Bush**, yes.

became a professor at **the **University of Utah****; is that
correct?
A. Yeah I was professor -- excuse me -- before I
was a professor in the evening hours while I was a judge
from 2002 to 2007. And then I resumed full time
teaching at **the **University of Utah**** in around November of
2007 when I left the bench.
Q. Okay. And since you've left the bench, have
you also been affiliated with a law firm?
A. Yes.
Q. Could you tell me what that affiliation is
what --
A. Sure. I'm a special counsel with Hatch James
and Dodge. It's a law firm, small boutique litigation
law firm in ****Salt Lake City****, Utah, and I occasionally do
cases with them.
Q. Is it fair to say that since 2007, since
resigning as a judge, you've been engaged at least on a
part-time basis in the practice of law?
A. Yes.
Q. And, in particular, in one of the cases
that's at issue here, what has been referred to as the
underlying CVRA case; you're familiar with that case?
A. Yeah. Let me be clear just the juxtaposition
of the causes, the CVRA case is not through Hatch James

and Dodge. That's through **the **University of Utah****. I'm
pro bono work through **the **University of Utah****.
Q. You have entered an appearance in that case?
A. Correct.
Q. And in order to enter that appearance, you
were admitted pro hac vice; is that correct?
A. That's right.

certified that you were familiar with the applicable
rules including the rules of **the Southern District** of
Florida; is that right?
A. That's right.
Q. And you're also familiar with the rules of
professional responsibility; is that correct?
A. Sure.
Q. Okay. As a judge, did you ever strike a

scandalous, irrelevant?
