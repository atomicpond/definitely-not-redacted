» Hi **Paul**. I've been spending lots of time with Irwin Corey and his family past two weeks especially. 
He was in hospital until **the last week** and then He died a few hours ago peacefully at home in bed. Last 
night he told me **Trump** will be assassinated soon. He was eager to learn the news **each day**. I asked him 
if he would join the anti **Trump** rallies when he gains strength. Doctors thought he might live many 
**months**. Alas he was laughing and smiling till the end and frowning about **Trump**. 
» Warm and loving regards

» My friend Alana, a young comedian, was here with him most nights. Irwin used to say he will live to 
147. Alana explained that 102 is 147 in comedian **years**.
