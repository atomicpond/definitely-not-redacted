EUROPEAN MULTI ASSET COVERAGE MEETING IMPRESSIONS: Eyes on Real Money outflows; 
**Christmas** comes early for most of macro players, hedge funds. Absolute majority bet on HRC to win, but 
majority still made good money because Hillary bets worked as Trump trades. 
Wider, steeper core rates, stronger **USD**, weaker EM is the Rage. The last one, EM, is the big loser out of 
Trump Reflation Theme. DM over EM and divergence within DM are very much in vogue. All gains of EMBI 
since **March** are gone! 
For Rates & FX, it does feel like **early days** of Taper Tantrum trade of 3 years ago. Both dominated by US 
price action. In both, hedge funds have now caught the moves, play offense & ride the Trump narrative. Real 
Money is on the ropes, caught long Fixed Income/duration/carry and cannot play defense fearing Outflows. 
In **Emerging Markets**, most outflows are retail, **ETF** driven. All eyes on next leg of institutions. In equities, 
banks big winners; FANGs losing. I asked partners 2 questions. 1) Would the "this will be great for business, 
feel good factor" wave out-run "if real yields go up, equities are a sell" fear. Clients are torn, but the former, 
bullish camp wins for now, my colleagues suggest. There are skeptics though. 
2) In **Europe**, do fears over Renzi losing & **Le Pen** winning climb over the big momentum behind banks etc. 
Again, my equity team suggests, "no, reflation wave **May** win over **Italy** referendum anxiety„ for now." Renzi 
is now widely expected to lose, so a "yes" would be the big surprise trade. And the bigger elephant in the room 
is **Le Pen**. If she wins in **May**, **Europe** as we know it **May** really shake.. But for now this is more in the radars 
of Euro & EBG traders. 
Core rates are driven by the speed of TY sell-off. And in G5 FX, the big driver is **USD**/**JPY**. The stronger "we 
should believe in Trump reflation narrative" winds are, the more **USD**/**JPY** buyers we see. 
Some in Research warn that Trump **May** succeed in "tax cuts, faster than any infrastructure spending," but few 
macro are in mood to listen. A few players believe, looking at trade weights of each with US and magnitude of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023717 
sell-off, Asia FX **May** have more weakness to come than **MXN**. Will copper/infrastructure rally eventually 
help **Chile**? 
Most macro love **NKY**, willing to love it more. Bringing it home; fast macro money players are rushing to 
erase losses, **year** long pains through wider rates, longer **USD**, weaker EM, stronger equities. 
Real Money is in defensive, remembering Taper Tantrum days, fearing institutional outflows & forced selling 
of carry hope positions. 
Those who want to "fade" Trump rally, seek valuation in EM, believe core rates can tighten to get a breather 
are in Minority.
