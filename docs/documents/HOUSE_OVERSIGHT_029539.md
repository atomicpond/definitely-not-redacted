Patt **MORRISON** Asks 
Alan Trounson, **California**'s Dr. Stem Cell 
As president of the ****California** Institute** for Regenerative Medicine, the Australian 
is helping guide the state to a high-tech medical future. 
Patt **MORRISON** 
**May 29**, **2013** 
In **2004**, with **President George** W. Bush dead set 
against stem cell research, **California** just went ahead 1> 
and did it. Voters made stem cell research a state 
constitutional right, and endorsed $3 billion in bond 
sales for **10 years** to cement the deal. CIRM, the 
****California** Institute** for Regenerative Medicine created 
under Proposition 71, has become a world center for 
stem cell research, and its president is Australian Alan 
Trounson, a pioneer in in vitro fertilization. As 
Proposition 71 approaches its 10-year anniversary, 
Trounson offers a prognosis. 
It's been almost **10 years** since **California** funded 
what may be the world's biggest stem cell research 
program. What are you up to?

L I_______ 
We are working hard to get six or seven projects to clinical trials. We have more than 70 [total] 
programs moving [toward] clinical trials. It's a lot of work to chaperon. 
I'll give you three examples: one, linking genetics, or genomics work, to stem cells, integrating the 
two. We're going to create a center in **California** that will bring a lot of [genetics] studies and clinical 
work to a new level. 
Secondly, we've set up a structure for banking the 3,000 cell lines from "induced pluripotent stem 
cells" that we turn into the equivalent of embryonic stem cells. We call them IPS cells. You take a 
skin cell or blood cell and convert it to the equivalent of an embryonic stem cell. 
We've also taken samples from patients with complex diseases, and we're banking these so scientists 
can "interrogate" these diseases — like heart disease, Alzheimer's, blindness. We are targeting a range 
of conditions — autism, cerebral palsy — for which we have scant understanding of causes and major 
drivers. This is material for long-term research studies.

What we're doing is meaningful. Somebody with cancer may have a better treatment. Parkinson's 
patients might be in a clinical trial around 2016, 2017. 
Are Californians getting enough bang for their buck? 
I think we're way ahead of what people predicted. Nevertheless, it takes a lot of time to do this. I think 
we're hurrying carefully. 
What else? 
I'm intending to set up a network of stem cell clinics in **California** in **the next couple of years**, to make 
treatments available as clinical trials or as registered treatments for patients. I'm going to ask the 
[CIRM] board for about $70 million to get that set up. It will make **California** a go-to place for stem 
cell therapies. I want to make sure it's part of our medical fabric. 
An **Oregon** scientist reports that he has cloned human stem cell lines. Is **Oregon** doing 
something different from **California**? 
The one thing that's different is that we can't compensate women adequately for donating eggs [as a 
source for creating a particular type of stem cell]. We can pay for the cost of drugs but not for the time 
and inconvenience. So that really does limit the number of women who would like to donate eggs to 
research, and that's a handicap. I think it would be very useful to develop those cell lines. 
The words "cloning" and "human" together set off alarm bells for some people. 
[Under Proposition 71] we can't do any reproductive cloning. We can't do it and we shouldn't do it — 
none of us wants to do that — but we would like to make those cell lines. 
Is stem cell research highly competitive now, as it was in **the 1980s**, when you were beginning 
your work? 
I don't think it's very competitive at all. There's a little bit of competition between **California** and 
**Harvard**, but that will always be the case, I suspect. What's important with [**California**'s] $3 billion is 
that it's taken away a lot of the silliness of the competition — that you hold your data and you don't 
show anyone and you wait until you [get it published] in a journal. In **Australia**, there's very few funds 
for this kind of work and so it's extremely competitive — you don't know what others are doing even 
in the same laboratory. That's not the case in **California**. People are collaborating, and that's why we're 
moving so fast because we work together. Scientists like to reach out to other scientists. 
Could embryonic stem cells become unnecessary because other cells can be just as adaptable? 
Maybe longer term. IPS cells have a very strong memory of what they were, whether they were a 
bloo
