Taking the Plunge

"New and noteworthy" is a term that gets tossed around a lot in the travel world, but we're taking it seriously to heart **this week** at Jetsetter. The "new" is the Dream Downtown NYC, a hip, reinvented space at the crossroads of **Chelsea** and the Meatpacking District (MePa, if you really must). The "noteworthy" is a little thing called skydiving at Mount Everest. Whether it's lounging poolside in **New York** or jumping out of a plane in full view of the world's highest mountain, there's a lot going on **this week**. Read on for all the details, including properties in **Paris**, **San Francisco**, **Vegas**, **Miami** and more. (Image: Skydive Mount Everest - on sale Sat, Aug 6.)

Dream Downtown - NYC

 
 <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=b729e29fef3ecc26669f0079f97f4b05246b2e0bd645fcdcbb33823945d94c9dbc460605a6f14795>  
 
	
	The new Dream Downtown has the best of both worlds. Housed in a **1960s** building designed by Albert C. Ledner, it's situated at the crux of **Manhattan**'s art, design and nightlife scenes between **Chelsea** and the Meatpacking District. With a hot rooftop bar, a **Miami**-meets-Ibiza pool (with lounge chairs set in real sand) and modern rooms with classic Downtown views, you can have your party and a good night's sleep, too.

Mon Hotel - **Paris**

 
 <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=21a04b983bc3ed3158e427404c99b10635d18fd87351d3be9f6540ad8a7d661c65871c8e749b24b9>  
 
	
	Just a short walk from the Arc de Triomphe, Mon Hotel sits on a quiet street off the bustling boulevards. Designer Aurélia Santoni fashioned this intimate boutique property with eccentricity and flair; lampshades from Dutch design firm Moooi hang above Utrecht armchairs in the lobby. Above all, the style of the guestrooms and the service stress comfort; Mon feels like your personal **Paris** pied-à-terre.

Candia Maris Resort - Crete

	Just outside Heraklion, Crete's capital city, the Candia Maris is a sprawling beachside resort spanning nearly 10 acres. Although the property lacks the charm of smaller hotels, it more than compensates with its amenities, which include tennis courts and seven pools. The highlight is the vast thalassotherapy spa, which underwent a multimillion-dollar renovation in **2008**.
