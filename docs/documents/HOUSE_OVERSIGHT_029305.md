Special Report
Post-DOMA Tax Implications Loom Large
In a 5 to 4 decision, **the **United States****
****Supreme Court**** has found that Section
3 of the federal Defense of Marriage
Act (DOMA) violates the equal protection
clause of the **Fifth Amendment** of the U.S.
Constitution as applied to persons of the
same sex who are legally married under the
laws of their state (Windsor, S.Ct., **June 26**,
2013, 2013-2 ustc ¶50,400). The majority,
written by Justice Anthony **Kennedy**,
held that DOMA is unconstitutional as
a deprivation of the liberty of the person
protected by the **Fifth Amendment** of the
Constitution.
The decision opens the door for same-sex
married couples to enjoy many federal taxrelated
benefits previously available only to
opposite-sex married couples. These include
income tax benefits, estate and gift tax benefits,
taxpayer-friendly employee benefits,
and more. Same-sex couples must now also
deal with circumstances under the tax law
that may create a so-called “marriage penalty.”
Employers must prepare for extensive
changes in the treatment of same-sex
couples. And individuals claiming tax credits
and other provisions under the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act are impacted
by the decision.
IMPACT. It is unclear how quickly the
IRS and other federal agencies will react
to ****the ****Supreme Court******’s** decision …or
how quickly same-sex couples may need
to act to protect certain rights. President
Obama has directed all federal
agencies, including **Treasury** and the
IRS, to revise their regulations to reflect
****the ****Supreme Court******’s** decision as soon as
possible. Many tax professionals had
been advising same-sex couples to file
protective refund claims in anticipation
of a favorable ruling from the Supreme
Court. This is one of several strategies
that practitioners and taxpayers should
follow up on, as well as filing amended
returns before the applicable limitations
periods expire on back tax years. The
decision to strike down DOMA goes beyond
refunds. Same-sex couples need to
consider many other tax implications.
IMPACT. **the ****Supreme Court****** did not extend
same-sex marriage nationwide; it declined
to say whether same-sex couples had
a Constitutional right to marriage that
would override state law. But the Supreme
Court’s decision has opened up federal
benefits –including those under the Internal
Revenue Code-- to same-sex couples
considered married under state law. The
Windsor decision leaves many additional
issues unresolved or unclear. Among them
are the status of “domestic partnerships”
and “civil unions” under state law in connection
with federal benefits, the status of
a same-sex couple married in one state but
now residing in a state in which same-sex
marriage is not recognized, and the ability
of married same-sex couples to divorce
without first moving back to a state that
recognizes same-sex marriage.
CAUTION. Immediately after the Windsor
decision was released, questions arose
regarding the impact of residency upon the
recognition of marital status for federal tax
purposes. Will same-sex couples duly married
in one state who now reside in a state
that does not recognize same-sex marriage
be entitled to federal benefits, including
being able to file jointly under the federal
tax laws? …Or will they be required to file
as single under federal law as well as state
law? While **President Obama** on June
27 expressed the view that same-sex marriages
performed in one state should apply

to another, he added that “I’m speaking as a
president and not as a lawyer.”
ISSUES AT STAKE
In **December 2012**, **the ****Supreme Court****** announced
that it would take up two cases related
to same-sex couples: Windsor, which
arose out of an estate tax dispute between a
surviving partner/spouse and the IRS; and
Hollingsworth v. Perry (CA-9, Feb. 7, 2012),
which addressed whether the equal protection
clause of the Fou
