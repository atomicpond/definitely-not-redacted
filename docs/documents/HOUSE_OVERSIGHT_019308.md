Bannon the European: He's opening the populist fort in **Brussels** 
The former **Trump** strategist arrives in **Europe** with "The **Movement**". Objective: an alliance between 
right-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections 
**New York**. The invasion of **Europe** has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru who 
was Donald **Trump**'s right-hand man in the **White **HOUSE**** — but let go **last summer** following the racist 
violence in **Charlottesville** — is preparing to march on **Brussels**. Launching, he told the **Daily Beast** 
himself, a new non-profit foundation called The **Movement**, (II **Movimento**), right in the heart of 
**Europe** and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view of the 
European elections which will be held in **spring 2019**. 
Objective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor of 
**the Democratic party**, who since 1984 with his **Open Society** has spent at least $32 billion in support of 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 019308 
NGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist right, accused 
of plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in order to have 
labour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on **Twitter** also by the current Minister of the **Interior** 
Matteo Salvini. 
The ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in the 
European campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in **London** and Rome 
— is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great "populist international" of which he has long 
since been dreaming. 
The **Movement**, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic 
advice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European movements. 
Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling funding. 
The aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of "super group" that if victorious can conquer up to a 
third of **the **European Parliament**** in the elections **next May**. 
Indeed — putting the common policy of **the Old Continent** in the hands of Bannon and his own. The 
American strategist is very attached to the **Freedom Caucus** — the extreme right of **the US Congress** — 
and in 2014 he was at the top of the ****Cambridge** Analytica** company, which in 2016 used data stolen 
from **Facebook** to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald **Trump** emerged victor. 
It is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to West. And he has 
already met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, **the French Marine Le Pen** and the former leader of 
the British separatists **Nigel Farage**. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on **Friday** in **Pennsylvania**, 
USA, to a fundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman **Lou Barletta**. Without forgetting the 
Italians of Lega and 5 stars. Of them, he said: "If it works in **Italy**, we can import the model anywhere". 
The **Movement**, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. In 
short, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries 
supporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But in 
the future the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in **Europe**. Also because 
the relationships with **Trump** have worsened after the revelations he made to **Michael Wolff** and 
published in the scandal book "Fire and Fury". "Better to reign in Hell than to serve in **Paradise**," 
Bannon says now paraphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's ****Lost **Paradise******. Hell 
in this case would be the dear old **Europe** and its democratic values. The "army of darkness" is already 
among us. 
In **Sacratissimo Corde Iesu** et Purissimo Corde Mariae et Castissimo Corde Ioseph.
