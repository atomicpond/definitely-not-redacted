Subject: Re: 
**Ken**, delighted to meet. Jeffrey has long told me about your friendship and the respect he has for you. If you 
send me your mailing address, it would be my pleasure to send you my recent book about the Trump White 
House. I'm now at work on a sequel focusing on the legal case against Trump and Trump's response to it. Any 
counsel and background you might provide would aid me enormously and enrich the book. I, of course, would 
be willing to talk with you on an entirely off-the-record basis or under any arrangement that suits. Thanks in 
advance and I look forward to the chance to chat. All best, **Michael**
