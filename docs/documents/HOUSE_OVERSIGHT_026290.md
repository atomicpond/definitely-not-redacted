Importance: High 
One guy in the **Times** article on him got it about right i think. 
Apart from the publicity hound bit, i think of him as a guy who cut and run in your case and looked out for 
himself. He never hesitates to respond to me by email; but when i read about something that came up in his 
deposition that i thought might help you and emailed him for a copy - radio silence. 
I guess **these days** he likes to make himself relevant. Oh well, we all have our strengths and weaknesses i am 
sure and i have many more of the latter.

By the way, your friend dershowitz is in hog heaven. He gets on every talk show on this issue, then he writes a 
piece about his friends now hate him, and **today** the **Times** has a piece about him writing a piece about how his 
friends hate him. He might just be the Kim Kardashian of the legal scene.

we're on the same team. strzok. testimony was that discussions with lovers , often include embellishments. 
and not indicative of non professionalism. I believe he said nothing more than it referenced" andys 
office". . paige says **andy** was there. how many other people were there ? were strzok and paige. off in the 
corner talking to each other. was **mccabe** on the phone? you know that taking emails alone is not 
meaningful. . isnt it a but much to say that prosecutors that have strong opinions . should be looked out with 
skepticism? who doesnt have bias. . strzok had many neg **hillary** opinions. . - **Michael Cohen**. michael 
flynn.. are not fictions created by ****mueller**** ? how are you ?

Gotti was an anomaly because of his personality (some agents loved him and some hated him); but I get your 
point. Couple of things: 
1. This the investigation of the President. It is only as good as public confidence in it can be (subtracting the 
conspiracy theorists on both sides). We just can't have someone with this kind of political bias as a lead 
investigator. But more importantly, he was not alone. He was just stupid enough to show it in office emails. We don't 
yet know what his private emails showed. Strzok, however, says that he met with **mccabe** - the number 2 guy in the 
**FBI** - and in his office discussed how best to stop **Trump** from becoming President. That just cannot be tolerated. Plus, 
if I find any evidence of personal or other extraneous animus in any case by any agent or prosecutor, I view it as an 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 026290 
open invitation for cross examination and any other exploitation possible as it cannot be an accepted part of the 
process. 
2. In this whole matter, I am most disturbed by the composition of the ****mueller**** team and it seems to me that if we are to 
learn anything from the IG's report it is the importance of having an investigation conducted above-board without 
personal and political baggage. ****mueller**** had a whole universe of lawyers from around the country to choose from to 
make up his team. He purposefully chose a murderer's row of the worst. I can go one by one; but I will spare 
you. Here are a couple of examples: 
A. Andrew **Weissmann** was known in the EDNY as "The Pathological Liar" after the **SNL** character. He literally would 
withhold exculpatory evidence throughout the case and then **one day** when defense counsel went to the bathroom or 
lunch, stick the documents under others on his table and tell the judge the lawyer had it all along. I have been brought 
into a case in which he lied from start to finish - and now his rats have come to me to admit their role in it - to get murder 
convictions in two cases. He has been cited by judges for his misconduct and he runined both **Arthur Anderson** and 
**Enron** through his work, all of which was rejected by the higher courts. He also is a **Trump** hater and **CLINTON** 
sycophant. ****mueller**** knows **Weissmann**'s conduct up close and personal. He chose **Weissmann** for his chief counsel at 
the **FBI** **years ago**. 
B. Jeannie Rhee, hand-picked by ****mueller**** from ****mueller****'s own firm, was actually **CLINTON**'s lawyer in the email 
investigation. Now how does that look. She also is a bully and thinks she is a real tough guy and I don't want that kind 
of character around. I also have an ineffective assistance of counsel case against her for a client in a $100 million 
earnings management fraud case in which she was way over her head. 
C. Greg Andres was another bully who replaced **Weissmann** in the EDNY. He withheld evidence terribly in his cases, 
regularly threatened others, and accused a defendant of putting out a contract on him when he knew it was a 
completely bogus claim, but gave him the publicity he craved. He is 100% in the pro-**CLINTON**, anti-**Trump** 
camp. **President Obama** gave hi
