About USA Inc.
Created and Compiled by Mary Meeker
February 2011
This report looks at **the ****Federal Government****** as if it were a business, with the goal of informing the
debate about our nation’s financial situation and outlook. In it, we examine USA Inc.’s income
statement and balance sheet. We aim to interpret the underlying data and facts and illustrate
patterns and trends in easy-to-understand ways. We analyze the drivers of federal revenue and
the history of expense growth, and we examine basic scenarios for how America might move
toward positive cash flow.
Thanks go out to Liang Wu and Fred Miller and former Morgan Stanley colleagues whose
contributions to this report were invaluable. In addition, Richard Ravitch, Emil Henry, Laura
Tyson, Al Gore, Meg Whitman, John Cogan, Peter Orszag and Chris Liddell provided inspiration
and insights as the report developed. It includes a 2-page foreword; a 12-page text summary;
and 460 PowerPoint slides containing data-rich observations. There’s a lot of material – think of
it as a book that happens to be a slide presentation.
We hope the slides in particular provide relevant context for the debate about America’s
financials. To kick-start the dialogue, we are making the entire slide portion of the report
available as a single work for non-commercial distribution (but not for excerpting, or modifying or
creating derivatives) under the **Creative Commons** license. The spirit of connectivity and sharing
has become the essence of the Internet, and we encourage interested parties to use the slides to
advance the discussion of America’s financial present and future. If you would like to add your
own data-driven observations, contribute your insights, improve or clarify ours, please contact us
to request permission and provide your suggestions. This document is only a starting point for
discussion; the information in it will benefit greatly from your thoughtful input.

February 2011
Our country is in deep financial trouble. Federal, state and local governments are deep in debt
yet continue to spend beyond their means, seemingly unable to stop. Our current path is simply
unsustainable. What to do?
A lot of people have offered suggestions and proposed solutions. Few follow the four key
guideposts to success that we see for setting our country back on the right path:
1) create a deep and widely held perception of the reality of the problem and the stakes involved;
2) reassure citizens that there are practical solutions;
3) develop support in key constituencies; and
4) determine the right timing to deliver the solutions.
USA Inc. uses each of these guideposts, and more; it is full of ideas that can help us build a
better future for our children and our country.
First, Mary Meeker and her co-contributors describe America’s problems in an imaginative way
that should allow anyone to grasp them both intellectually and emotionally. By imagining the
****Federal Government**** as a company, they provide a simple framework for understanding our
current situation. They show how deficits are piling up on our income statement as spending
outstrips income and how our liabilities far exceed nominal assets on our balance sheet. USA
Inc. also considers additional assets – hard to value physical assets and our intangible wealth –
our creativity and energy and our tradition of an open, competitive society.
Additionally, the report considers important trends, pointing specifically to an intolerable failure to
educate many in the K-12 grades, despite our knowledge of how to do so. And all these
important emotional arguments help drive a gut reaction to add to data provided to reinforce the
intellectual reasons we already have.
Second, USA Inc. provides a productive way to think about solving our challenges. Once we
have created an emotional and intellectual connection to the problem, we want people to act and
drive the solution, not to throw up their hands in frustration. The authors’ ingenious indirect
approach is to ask what a turnaround expert would do and what questions he or she would ask.
The report describes how we first stumbled into this mess, by failing to predict the magnitude of
program costs, by creating perverse incentives for excessive behavior, and by missing important
trends. By pointing to the impact of individual responsibility, USA Inc. gives us reason to believe
that a practical solution exists and can be realized.

Third, the report highlights how powerful bipartisan constituencies have emerged in the past to
tackle great issues for the betterment of our nation, including tax reform, civil liberties,
healthcare, education and national defense. Just as presidents of both parties rose to the
occasion to pr
