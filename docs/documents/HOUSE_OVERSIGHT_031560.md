Importance: High 
Personal/Political bias is one thing (I still would exploit it any and every time on cross); this was an obsession and directly 
relevant "Stop **Trump**." Also, the IG made clear in his testimony **Strzok** told him **mccabe** was there. **mccabe** is another 
real character. He denies this; but he also is irreconcilably at odds with **Comey** on **WSJ** leak. Absolutely right that taking 
emails alone is not fair; but I would point out that it is folks like **Strzok** and company who have ruined many a 
businesman's life based exclusively on a twisted reading of emails sold to a jury. **flynn** is an interesting case. I believe I 
could have gotten his plea back for him in a second based on what has surfaced; but he decided to go a different 
way. But as to your underlying point that there might well be something to go after with these guys, I hear you; but I have 
spent my whole career fighting bullies and crooked, unethical prosecutors. That will remain a guiding principle for me, 
whether the target is popular, hated, a complete jerk, guilty, etc. I am doing ok, thanks. I see you really follow this stuff.

we're on the same team. **Strzok**. testimony was that discussions with lovers , often include embellishments, and not 
indicative of non professionalism. I believe he said nothing more than it referenced " andys office". . says **andy** 
was there. how many other people were there ? were **Strzok** and . off in the corner talking to each other. was 
**mccabe** on the phone? you know that taking emails alone is not meaningful. . isnt it a but much to say that 
prosecutors that have strong opinions . should be looked out with skepticism? who doesnt have bias. . **Strzok** had 
many neg **hillary** opinions .. - **Michael Cohen**. **Michael **flynn****.. are not fictions created by ****mueller**** ? how are you ?

Gotti was an anomaly because of his personality (some agents loved him and some hated him); but I get your 
point. Couple of things: 
1. This the investigation of the President. It is only as good as public confidence in it can be (subtracting the conspiracy 
theorists on both sides). We just can't have someone with this kind of political bias as a lead investigator. But more 
importantly, he was not alone. He was just stupid enough to show it in office emails. We don't yet know what his private 
emails showed. **Strzok**, however, says that he met with **mccabe** - the number 2 guy in the **FBI** - and in his office 
discussed how best to stop **Trump** from becoming President. That just cannot be tolerated. Plus, if I find any evidence 
of personal or other extraneous animus in any case by any agent or prosecutor, I view it as an open invitation for cross 
examination and any other exploitation possible as it cannot be an accepted part of the process. 
2. In this whole matter, I am most disturbed by the composition of the ****mueller**** team and it seems to me that if we are to 
learn anything from the IG's report it is the importance of having an investigation conducted above-board without 
personal and political baggage. ****mueller**** had a whole universe of lawyers from around the country to choose from to 
make up his team. He purposefully chose a murderer's row of the worst. I can go one by one; but I will spare you. Here 
are a couple of examples: 
A. Andrew **Weissmann** was known in the EDNY as "The Pathological Liar" after the **SNL** character. He literally would 
withhold exculpatory evidence throughout the case and then **one day** when defense counsel went to the bathroom or 
lunch, stick the documents under others on his table and tell the judge the lawyer had it all along. I have been brought 
into a case in which he lied from start to finish - and now his rats have come to me to admit their role in it - to get murder 
convictions in two cases. He has been cited by judges for his misconduct and he runined both **Arthur Anderson** and 
**Enron** through his work, all of which was rejected by the higher courts. He also is a **Trump** hater and **CLINTON** 
sycophant. ****mueller**** knows **Weissmann**'s conduct up close and personal. He chose **Weissmann** for his chief counsel at 
the **FBI** **years ago**. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 031560 
B. Jeannie Rhee, hand-picked by ****mueller**** from ****mueller****'s own firm, was actually **CLINTON**'s lawyer in the email 
investigation. Now how does that look. She also is a bully and thinks she is a real tough guy and I don't want that kind 
of character around. I also have an ineffective assistance of counsel case against her for a client in a $100 million 
earnings management fraud case in which she was way over her head. 
C. Greg Andres was another bully who replaced **Weissmann** in the EDNY. He withheld evidence terribly in his cases, 
regularly threatened others, and accused a defendant of
