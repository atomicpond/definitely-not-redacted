Importance: **High 
Good**. Sorting out Tulum at the moment. Over 40 people wanted to come. The Cenote project didn't get 
funded yet so we are sorting out accommodations. David Sauvage who you met is coming 
(https://docs.google.com/document/d/lzebY0wGi vn1WpUnkTR1T7yPsl-iQIfA9GidDUgOzeU/edit). Joon 
Yun as well (who I'd like to introduce you to - http://www.drjoonyun.com/). The gathering will help plan 
activities in 2017 which I will summarise for you in Jan. 
On **Monday**, I head to Pragelato with the wife and kids for **10 days** of skiing and sight-seeing. Head to Tulum 
on the 1st. I will be at DLD and Davos afterward. I still have a Vive that I got for you that I'd like to set up and 
walk you and your people through. 
Is your schedule for the holidays sorted? 
Happy Holidays!!

Schulte Research Report, ED 164: Slides 
1. Ping An & CICC are the 2 H shares that operate in the middle of **Alibaba**, **Tencent**, Lufax. 
A. The chart below represents a deep dive we did on the new world of Chinese banking. Companies 
like Zhong An, WeBank and Lufax will grow dramatically and will take advantage of (as well as 
support) the massive worlds of **Alibaba** and **Tencent**. Together, **Alibaba** and **Tencent** have market cap 
of $500 bn. Popping up in many of these areas of overlap are Ping An and CICC. They are 
strategically placed to make great strides in China. This is slowly being recognized in the case of Ping 
AN (See Page 8 of attached PPT). Ping An's market cap is $97 bn. It is connected to Zhong An.. It 
owns 44% of Lufax. And some if its management were the very ones that started WeBank. It is 
perfectly positioned for the coming boom in new banking. It has the best combined ROA and ROE 
globally and its P/E of 10x is trading on a 50% discount to the global averages. Why is Ping An 
trading at a discount to AIA? BUY PING AN -- SELL AIA.. 
B. The other company which has the best return on capital of any broker dealer -- and is also  
positioned nicely for the coming boom in the new era of banking in China -- is CICC. CICC and CDH 
(a CICC breakaway) both invested in Zhong An and Lufax. CICC has vision and a proven track record. 
Yet it has been a laggard. This is a top pick for H shares for China in 2017. The other bank with great 
vision in this area is CCB, which has invested in Ant Financial. BUY H shares CCB and CICC. (See 
attached PPT for portfolios and China fintech details). 
C. IPOs in 2017. I think Zhong An will be a surprise for 2017 in the **Hong Kong** market. Its market 
cap is expected to be $10 bn and it has interesting potential in so many areas of insurance. It 
remains an insurance company whose marginal cost of a new customer is zero. It has a talented 
team of 900 engineers and has new Al and blockchain divisions. It is rolling out an impressive array 
of products including corporate solutions for insurance and investment plans. Lufax CEO Greg Gibb 
made a big splash at the Finnovasia (Schulte Research co-sponsored it)
