SUBJECT: Market Value Appraisal 
IGY American Yacht Harbor Marina

Dear Mr. Soltero: 
Integra Realty Resources — **Caribbean** is pleased to submit the accompanying appraisal of 
the referenced property. The purpose of the appraisal is to develop an opinion of the 
market value of the leased fee (going concern) interest in the property. The client for the 
assignment is Banco Popular de **Puerto Rico**, and the intended use is for Commercial credit 
administration. 
The appraisal is intended to conform with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal 
Practice (USPAP), the Code of Professional Ethics and Standards of Professional Appraisal 
Practice of the Appraisal Institute, the Principles of Appraisal Practice and Code of Ethics of 
the American Society of Appraisers, the RICS Valuation Professional Standards, the 
International Valuation Standards, applicable jurisdictional appraisal regulations, and the 
appraisal guidelines of Banco Popular de **Puerto Rico**. The appraisal is also prepared in 
accordance with the appraisal regulations issued in connection with the Financial 
Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA). 
To report the assignment results, we use the Appraisal Report option of Standards Rule 2-
2(a) of USPAP. As USPAP gives appraisers the flexibility to vary the level of information in an 
Appraisal Report depending on the intended use and intended users of the appraisal, we

adhere to the Integra Realty Resources internal standards for an Appraisal Report — 
Standard Format. This format summarizes the information analyzed, the appraisal methods 
employed, and the reasoning that supports the analyses, opinions, and conclusions. 
The subject is an existing 250-slip marina with 5 commercial buildings containing a mixture 
of retail and office space types. The buildings contain 48,661 square feet of rentable area 
and were constructed in multiple stages; with the majority of the construction completed in 
1993. The commercial space is 85% leased as of the effective appraisal date. The marina 
docks were constructed in multiple phases between 1991-1995 and are 52.8% occupied as 
of the effective appraisal date. The total site area is 2.76 acres or 120,226 square feet, which 
includes 0.64 acre or 27,878 square feet, that is re-claimed land. The property also includes 
3.2 acres of seabed under the marina dock structures which is leased to the property owner 
from the Government of **the **Virgin Islands****. 
Based on the valuation analysis in the accompanying report, and subject to the definitions, 
assumptions, and limiting conditions expressed in the report, our opinion of value is as 
follows: 
Value Conclusion* 
Appraisal Premise 
Market Value 
Interest Appraised Date of Value Value Conclusion 
Leased Fee (Going Concern) **November 25**, 2015 $24,360,000 
*Values expressed in **United States** Dollars 
Allocation of Going Concern Value 
Amount 	% of Total 
Tangible Property 
Land & Improvements 	$24,250,000 	99.5% 
Tangible Personal Property (FF&E) 	$110,000 	0.5% 
Total Tangible Property 	$24,360,000 	100.0% 
I nta ngi ble Assets 	$0 	0.0% 
Market Value* 	$24,360,000 	100.0% 
*Specifically excluded from the valuation are cash and equivalents and current liabilities. 
The allocation of value components is based on the going-concern premise, which holds that 
the value of a business as a going-concern is equal to the sum of the values of the tangible 
and intangible assets. The allocation assumes continued operation of the marina business. 
Were the marina business to cease operations, the values of the individual components 
would likely be different from the allocated values of the going concern.
