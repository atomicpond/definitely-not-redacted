Honorable **Mark Filip** 
**Office** of the Deputy Attorney General 
****United States** **Department** of Justice** 
**950 **Pennsylvania Avenue****, N.W.

Joe D. **Whitley

CONFIDENTIAL 
In his confirmation hearings **last fall**, Judge Mukasey admirably lifted up the finest 
traditions of **the **Department** of Justice** in assuring **the **United States**** **Senate**, and the American 
people, of his solemn intent to ensure fairness and integrity in the administration of justice. Your 
own confirmation hearings echoed that bedrock determination to assure that the **Department** 
conduct itself with honor and integrity, especially in the enforcement of federal criminal law. 
We come to you in that spirit and respectfully ask for a review of the federal involvement 
in a quintessentially state matter involving our client, Jeffrey Epstein. While we are well aware 
of the rare instances in which a review of this sort is justified, we are confident that the 
circumstances at issue warrant such an examination. Based on our collective experiences, as 
well as those of other former senior **Justice **Department**** officials whose advice we have sought, 
we have never before seen a case more appropriate for oversight and review. Thus, while neither 
of us has previously made such a request, we do so now in the recognition that both **the 
**Department****'s reputation, as well as the due process rights of our client, are at issue. 
Recently, **the **Criminal Division**** concluded a very limited review of this matter at the 
request of U.S. Attorney **Alex Acosta**. Critically, however, this review deliberately excluded 
many important aspects of this case. Just this past Friday, on May 16, 2008, we received a letter 
from the head of CEOS informing us that CEOS had conducted a review of this case. By its own 
admission, the CEOS review was "limited, both factually and legally." Part of the self-imposed 
limitation was CEOS's abstention from addressing our "allegations of professional misconduct 
by federal prosecutors"—even though such misconduct was, as we contend it is, inextricably 
intertwined with the credibility of the accusations being made against Mr. Epstein by the United 
States Attorney's **Office** in Miami ("USAO"). Moreover, CEOS did not assess the terms of the 
Deferred Prosecution Agreement now in effect, nor did CEOS review the federal prosecutors' 
inappropriate efforts to implement those terms. We detail this point below.

By way of background, we were informed by Mr. Acosta that, at his request, CEOS 
would be conducting a review to determine whether federal prosecution was both appropriate 
and, in his words, "fair." That is not what occurred. Instead, CEOS has now acknowledged that 
we had raised "many compelling arguments" against the USAO's suggested "novel application" 
of federal law in this matter. Even so, CEOS concluded, in minimalist fashion, that "we do not 
see anything that says to us categorically that a federal case should not be brought" and that the 
U.S. Attorney "would not be abusing his prosecutorial discretion should he authorize federal 
prosecution of Mr. Epstein" thus delegating back to Mr. Acosta the decision of whether federal 
prosecution was warranted (emphasis added). Rather than assessing whether prosecution would 
be appropriate, CEOS, using a low baseline for its evaluation, determined only that "it would not 
be impossible to prove . . ." certain allegations made against Mr. Epstein. The CEOS review 
failed to address the significant problems involving the appearance of impermissible selectivity 
that would necessarily result from a federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein. 
We respect CEOS 's conclusion that its authority to review "misconduct" issues was 
precluded by **Criminal Division** practice. We further respect CEOS 's view that it understood its 
mission as significantly limited. Specifically, the contemplated objective was to determine 
whether the USAO would be abusing its discretion by bringing a federal prosecution rather than 
making its own de novo recommendations on the appropriate reach of federal law. However, we 
respectfully submit that a full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of the 
**Justice **Department****. In an effort to inform you of the nature of the federal investigation against 
Mr. Epstein, we summarize the facts and circumstances of this matter below. 
The two base-level concerns we hold are that (1) federal prosecution of this matter is not 
warranted based on the purely-local conduct and the unprecedented application of federal 
statutes to facts such as these and (2) the actions of federal authorities are both highly 
questionable and give rise to an appearance of substantial impropr
