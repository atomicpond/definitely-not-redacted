**Manafort** ratted on Donald Jr.'s meeting with the Russian lawyer  
**Trump**'s former campaign manager Paul **Manafort** alerted authorities to Donald **Trump** Jr.'s infamous meeting 
with the Russian lawyer during his father's presidential campaign. 
**Manafort**, who is facing increasing pressure from U.S. special counsel **Robert **Mueller****, divulged **Trump** Jr.'s 
meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya about three months ago, **Bloomberg** reported. 
Responding to a congressional request for information, **Manafort** revealed the meeting and provided 300 
documents, although **FBI** agents went on to raid his **Virginia** home **two weeks ago**. 
**Trump**, responding to news of the raid, said, "I was very, very surprised to see it... .I've always found Paul 
**Manafort** to be a very decent man." 
Investigators are looking into accusations of money laundering in an attempt to pressure **Manafort** into 
cooperating with the probe into the **Trump** campaign's possible ties to **Russia**, two sources told **Reuters**. 
"If **Mueller**'s team can threaten criminal charges against **Manafort**, they could use that as leverage to convince 
him to cooperate," said one of the sources. 
But the former campaign manager's spokesman Jason Maloni said, "Paul **Manafort** is not a cooperating 
witness." 
Maloni also told **Bloomberg** that **Manafort** was enlisting the services of a D.C.-based law firm Miller & 
Chevalier,which focuses on tax law, to replace WilmerHale, where **Mueller** previously worked. 
**Mueller**'s investigation has extended to global bank transactions involving **Manafort**, as well as his business 
partner Rick Gates and son-in-law, Jeffrey Yohai. 
Yohai, who is under investigation for real estate deals he made with **Manafort**, turned over documents to 
**Mueller**'s probe more than two months
