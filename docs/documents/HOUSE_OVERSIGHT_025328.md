﻿For Radio Host
Of the Counterculture,
It Was a Strange Trip
By COREY KILGANNON
For **a half century**, Bob Fass, 85,
has presided over the late-night
airwaves of **New York City** with a
radio show named “Radio Unnameable,”
which has aired since
1963 on WBAI-FM, the listenersupported
haven for the radical
left.
As a self-described “midwife at
the birth of the counterculture,”
Mr. Fass, in his time behind the
microphone, has borne witness to
some unusual episodes.
The second night his show
aired, a listener set the tone by delivering
marijuana to the station.
There was the time, in 1966, when
**Bob Dylan** showed up in the studio
and began taking callers and
cracking jokes. In 1971, Mr. Fass
essentially talked a caller out of
committing suicide while on the
air.
But lately, Mr. Fass’s life has begun
imitating the craziness of his
show, ever since he and his wife,
Lynnie, attempted to move out of
their Staten Island home to a new
house in Danbury, Conn., setting
off a misadventure worthy of one
of his distressed late night callers.
**last month**, moments after he
entered his new home, as the
movers were carrying in his belongings,
Mr. Fass casually flicked
on a gas fireplace, which promptly
malfunctioned and set the house
on fire.
It was a two-alarm blaze that
left Mr. Fass, who uses a wheelchair,
inhaling smoke for several
minutes until the movers rushed
in and carried him out.
“I could have been roast D.J.,”
said Mr. Fass. “Have you ever
heard the Warren Zevon song ‘I
was in the House When the House
Burned Down?’”
And so the “Unnameable” radio
host now faces an unknowable future.
Even in adversity, though, Mr.
Fass, whose show airs Thursday
nights at midnight, can be counted
on for a pithy take on things. His
improvisational monologues and
his mix of guests and music
helped pioneer free-form radio,
and his show was a vital forum for
activists, musicians, and everyday
people to come together
around issues including the Vietnam
War, drugs and social justice.
After the fire, with nowhere else
to stay, the Fasses returned to
their empty house on Lake Avenue
on Staten Island, near the
Bayonne Bridge, where they live
with their 10 or so adopted feral
cats.
****Los Angeles**** — When
Robert A. Durst was asked why he
had talked to the makers of “The
Jinx” — the 2015 HBO documentary
about the suspicions that had
dogged him for years over the untimely
deaths of his first wife, a
close confidante and a cantankerous
neighbor in Texas — he said
he had thought it was low risk.
It was unlikely, he said, that any
prosecutor would “commence a
major, budget-busting investigation”
for a couple of cold cases.
But shortly before the last
episode was broadcast, John
Lewin, a deputy district attorney
in ****Los Angeles****, proved Mr. Durst
wrong. Mr. Lewin, who has a long
record of winning guilty verdicts
in cold murder cases, had him arrested
in **New Orleans**.
Mr. Lewin would eventually
charge Mr. Durst with the execution-style
murder in ****Los Angeles****
in 2000 of his confidante, Susan
Berman. Preliminary hearings in
the case were held in a courtroom
here **last week**.
The prosecution contends that
Mr. Durst, the alienated scion of a
New York real estate family, killed
Ms. Berman with a gunshot to the
back of the head to prevent her
from revealing her role in helping
him cover up the murder of his
first wife, Kathie Durst, to investigators
who had reopened that
case.
In a sense, Mr. Lewin must
prove two cold cases, not just one.
“It is important to understand
that all of the defendant’s subsequent
criminal conduct can be
traced back to his original killing
of his wife Kathie **decades** earlier,
and his subsequent efforts to
avoid criminal culpability for her
death,” he said in court papers.
Mr. Lewin, who declined to be
interviewed for this story, has
talked to virtually every witness
in the case, which covers **40 years**
and has a cast of dozens. During
court hearings over **the past year**,
he has displayed an encyclopedic
knowledge of Mr. Durst, his history,
his friends and his alleged
victims.
Mr. Lewin has conducted punishing
examinations of Mr. Durst’s
friends and even of the now-retired
detective who first looked
into the disappearance of Ms.
Durst.
“He’s a pit bull,” said Kathie
Durst’s brother, Jim McCormack.
There is little doubt by either
side that the hearings, which adjourned
after **four days** of testimony
and argument, will conclude
in **October** with Judge Mark
Windham binding Mr. Durst over
for trial, starting probably early
next year.
But that does not mean that Mr.
Lewin has a clear path to another
guilty verdict. Mr. Lewin and his
colleagues will still have to contend
with hazy, in some cases 40-
year-old memories; the lack of the
weapon in Ms. Berman’s shooting;
and the absence of a body or
even a crime scene in the disappearance
and presumed death of
Ms. Durst, for which no one has
ever been charged.
Mr. Durst, 75, frail and worth
$100 million, has said repeatedly
that he did not kill his first wife,
nor does he know who killed Ms.
Berman. And despite the cert
