"**Blackstone** anticipates that the program will have $40 billion in total equity commitments in a permanent 
capital vehicle, including $20 billion to be raised from other investors," **Blackstone** said in a statement 
announcing the planned launch of the investment fund. "The MOU is non-binding and the parties will continue 
their negotiation to agree definitive documentation." 
Brookings Institution Senior Fellow Bruce Riedel was even less charitable. "There is no deal. It's fake news," he 
wrote in a scathing piece on the Brookings website. "I've spoken to contacts in the defense business and on the 
Hill, and all of them say the same thing: there are a bunch of letters of interest or intent, but not contracts. Many 
are offers that the defense industry thinks the Saudis will be interested in someday." 
It could be **years** before anyone knows for sure whether the preliminary agreements announced in ****Saudi Arabia**** 
have become real deals worth hundreds of billions, or whether the announcements were the kind of hyperbole 
**Trump** perfected during his time in the business world.
