﻿Call to Action!
The impact of funding decline on female empowerment through the FC2 female
condom and the increase of HIV/AIDS
Facts
36.7 million
People living with HIV/AIDS worldwide **2015**
1 in 25 Adults
Are living with HIV in Sub **Saharan **Africa****
1.1 million
People died of AIDS-related illnesses worldwide
**2015**
70%
Of people living with HIV worldwide are found in
Sub-**Saharan **Africa****
51% are women
More than half of people living with HIV/AIDS are women
Since the beginning of the epidemic, more than 70 million people have been infected with the
HIV virus and about 35 million people have died of HIV. Globally, 36.7 million [34.0–39.8
million] people were living with HIV at the end of **2015**. An estimated 0.8% [0.7-0.9%] of
adults aged 15–49 years worldwide are living with HIV, although the burden of the epidemic
continues to vary considerably between countries and regions. Sub-**Saharan **Africa****
remains most severely affected, with nearly 1 in every 25 adults (4.4%) living with HIV
and accounting for nearly 70% of the people living with HIV worldwide (**WHO**, GHO Data).
Problem
Male and female condoms remain the only dual protection devices in the world that protect men
and women from both STIs, such as HIV, as well as unplanned pregnancy. The FC2 female
condom remains the only dual protection device in the world that is both **WHO** and USFDA
approved and is under the full control of women. Research shows that when a male
and female condom are both available in the same market the overall number of protected sex
acts goes up with as much as 13% (**2006**: Hatzell, Feldblum & Van Damme).
Historically, the FC2 female condom has been procured by UNFPA (United Nations Population
Fund) and **USAID** (United States Agency for **International Development**). Recently, UNFPA
has had a 50% decrease in available funding for all their commodity procurement, and the
**USAID** procurement budget is being slashed under the **Trump** administration leading to a major
decline of female condom procurement in **Africa**:
2016 **2015** 2014 2013 **2012**
UNFPA 10,60 11,21 17,14 34,15 24,55
**USAID** 9,96 10,02 7,32 4,5 15,63
On a per country example this has led to, for instance, an **annual** need for 3 million
FC2 female condoms in **Uganda**, and no funding to procure. A need of 1 million
female condoms **annually** in **Kenya**, and funding for only 230,000. A need of 6 million female
condoms **annually** in **Zimbabwe** and funding for only 3 million. And these are just some
examples of the many countries **WHO** do not receive their actual FC2 female condom need on
the continent of **Africa**.
Solution
Female Health **Company** would like to propose a partnership with new donors
in order to ensure that the need for the FC2 female condom is met in **Africa** to ensure
prevention of HIV/AIDS among the target groups that need it. FHC is committed to
providing the training and technical support to the countries and target groups to ensure correct
and safe usage of the FC2 female condom, if donors are willing to procure the female condoms
that are necessary in these countries. We could even create a specific donor brand for the
FC2 female condom, to increase brand recognition for the donor in the region while
saving lives together.
On Female Health **Company**
The Female Health **Company** manufactures, markets and sells the FC2 Female Condom. FC2 is the only currently
available female-controlled product approved by the U.S. Food and **Drug Administration** (**FDA**) and cleared by
**the World Health Organization** (**WHO**) for purchase by U.N. agencies that provides dual protection against
unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV/AIDS. The **Company**'s first
generation product was the FC1 Female Condom, a Class III medical device approved by **FDA** in **1993**. The
**Company**'s second generation product, FC2, has been available globally since **2007**, and in the U.S. since **2009**
after it was approved by the **FDA** as a Class III medical device. To date, FHC has shipped its female condom to
over 140 countries worldwide.
Currently, there are only two **FDA** approved and marketed products that prevent the transmission of HIV/AIDS
through sexual intercourse: the male condom and FC2. FC2 is currently the only **FDA** approved and marketed
female-controlled product that prevents STIs, including HIV/AIDS. Used consistently and correctly, FC2 provides
women dual protection against STIs, including HIV/AIDS, and unintended pregnancy. When used correctly the
protection rates against unintended pregnancies are 95 percent for female condoms compared to 98 percent for
male condoms according to the **FDA**. FC2 is not seen as directly competing with the male condom; it provides an
alternative to either unprotected sex or male condom usage.
An economic analysis of the cost effectiveness of an FC2 HIV/AIDS prevention program conducted by Dr. David
Holtgrave, the chairman of the Department of Health Behavior and Society at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg
School of **Public Health**, was featured in the March 26, **2012** issue of AIDS and Behavior. The study s
