**Crime Victims**’ RIGHTS DURING
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS?
APPLYING THE **Crime Victims**’ RIGHTS
ACT BEFORE CRIMINAL CHARGES ARE
FILED
**Paul G. Cassell***
NATHANAEL J. MITCHELL**&
**Bradley J. Edwards*****
This Article addresses whether **Crime Victims** should have rights during
criminal investigations, using **the **Crime Victims**’ Rights Act** (CVRA) as the
focal point for our discussion. This is a critical issue, as many criminal
cases may never proceed to formal charging. If **Crime Victims** have no
rights during criminal investigations, then many **Crime Victims** will never
have any rights at all.
The issue of whether **Crime Victims** have rights in the criminal justice
process recently came to a head when **the **Justice Department**** released a
memorandum contending that the CVRA does not extend **Crime Victims** any
rights until prosecutors choose to file formal criminal charges. This led the
CVRA’s Senate cosponsor, then-Senator Jon Kyl, to fire off an angry letter
to **the **Justice Department**** attacking its position. In our Article, we side
with the Act’s cosponsor. We believe that, properly understood, the CVRA
does extend **Crime Victims**’ rights during criminal investigations.
Our Article proceeds in four parts. First, it highlights the importance
of applying the Act before the formal filing of charges by illustrating how
dozens of victims in a notorious federal sex abuse case were deprived of the

ability to participate meaningfully in the criminal process when federal
prosecutors narrowly interpreted their responsibilities under the Act.
Second, the Article reviews the purpose, text, structure, and history of the
CVRA, concluding that they all support the conclusion that **Crime Victims**
have rights during criminal investigations. Third, our Article critiques the
Department’s memorandum, demonstrating that the Department’s analysis
is unpersuasive. Fourth and finally, the Article provides a specific
approach for determining when rights should attach—specifically when
federal law enforcement agencies have identified a crime with sufficient
precision to send a “target” letter to a criminal defendant. We also
observe that federal and state prosecutors have already accorded rights to
victims before formally filing charges, which further undermines the
Department’s overly narrow construction of the Act.
