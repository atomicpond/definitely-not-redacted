Maz is the most devious and cunning of the bunch. However, Editors can pay for people, stories and documents. They can even pay 
criminals if it is in the public interest. 
Maz can pay who he wants for info but the Yorkshire Ripper for instance, as a convicted criminal, can't sell his story.. unless in public 
interest cos there was say, a bent detective. 
Below is from PCC Code for Editors. It is not well drafted.

Witness payments in criminal trials 
i) No payment or offer of payment to a witness - or any person who 
may reasonably be expected to be called as a witness - should be made 
in any case once proceedings are active as defmed by the Contempt of 
Court Act **1981**. 
This prohibition lasts until the suspect has been freed 
unconditionally by police without charge or bail or the proceedings 
are otherwise discontinued; or has entered a guilty plea to the court; 
or, in the event of a not guilty plea, the court has announced its 
verdict. 
*ii) Where proceedings are not yet active but are likely and 
foreseeable, editors must not make or offer payment to any person who 
may reasonably be expected to be called as a witness, unless the 
information concerned ought demonstrably to be published in the public 
interest and there is an over-riding need to make or promise payment 
for this to be done; and all reasonable steps have been taken to 
ensure no financial dealings influence the evidence those witnesses 
give. In no circumstances should such payment be conditional on the 
outcome of a trial. 
*iii) Any payment or offer of payment made to a person later cited to 
give evidence in proceedings must be disclosed to the prosecution and 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 030229 
defence. The witness must be advised of this requirement.

*Payment to criminals 
i) Payment or offers of payment for stories, pictures or information, 
which seek to exploit a particular crime or to glorify or glamorise 
crime in general, must not be made directly or via agents to convicted 
or confessed criminals or to their associates — who may include 
family, friends and colleagues. 
ii) Editors invoking the public interest to justify payment or offers 
would need to demonstrate that there was good reason to believe the 
public interest would be served. If, despite payment, no public 
interest emerged, then the material should not be published.

Actually school means university in the states. I think probably best not to get into the legality or not of sexual activity of young 
people and nor is it relevant to JE case as he was in his late 40's at the time of this story. .the headline is deliberately wrong. school adults 
would have been accurate..

We should think about a letter to the editor **today**. 'School' can mean university. Age of consent in **Florida** is complex — see 
below: 
If you are 16-yrs-old, a sexual relationship with someone 18-24is legal in **Florida**. The two persons involved must be between 16 
and 24. 
**Florida** Statute 794.05 
(1) A person 24 years of age or older who engages in sexual activity with a person 16 or 17 years of age commits a felony of the 
second degree.

So as soon as you turn 16 you are able to have sexual relations. And you can have sexual relations with a minor (under 18) until 
your 24th birthday.

Details of the disturbing lifestyle led by ****Jeffrey** **Epstein**** emerged **last night** after the ****Daily Mail**** uncovered logs of telephone 
messages left at his **Florida** child sex den. 
Schoolchildren were among hundreds of callers who apparently rang to arrange massages for the 58-year-old billionaire friend of 
Prince Andrew, who was later convicted of child sex offences. 
******Ghislaine** **Maxwell******, 49-year-old daughter of the disgraced media mogul **Robert **Maxwell****, is named in several messages. 
Disturbing: Messages were found in **Florida** home of ****Jeffrey** **Epstein****, left. The billionaire, 58, is a friend of Prince Andrew, right 
In one left for her or '**Sarah**', a caller says she 'doesn't know at what time she must come this night for the massage'. 
Other messages for **Epstein**, the sources of which are not clear, contain
