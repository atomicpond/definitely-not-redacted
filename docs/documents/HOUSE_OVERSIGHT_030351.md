Other stuff I am sympathetic -- but to answer a random **Gmail** email, that is not smart! 
How are you **Trump** contacts responding to **Comey**?

**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 030351 
The subject of the email should have been warning enough for **Jes **Staley****, the embattled 
chief executive of **Barclays**. At quarter to nine on **Wednesday** evening, after a bruising 
shareholders' meeting, Mr **Staley** received a message purporting to be from his chairman, 
****John** McFarlane**. The heading read: "The fool doth think he is wise". 
In fact, the message was from a prankster, using the **Gmail** account 
**John**.mcfarlane.**Barclays**@**Gmail**.com. The imposter described Michael Mason-Mahon, an 
individual shareholder who called for Mr **Staley** to resign at **Wednesday**'s **annual** meeting, 
"as brusque as he is ill informed" and went on to reassure the **Barclays** chief executive that 
together they had successfully seen off any attempt to force Mr **Staley** out. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 030352 
"Surely the fickleminded nature of the angry few will help tie up any loose ends," the short 
email concluded. "You owe me a large Scotch." 
Mr **Staley**, who has been heavily criticised for his attempt to unmask a whist] ebl ower, 
soon replied to the prankster in effusive terms. Presumably thinking he was talking to his 
chairman, who has been dubbed "Mack the Knife" for his habit of ousting chief executives, 
Mr **Staley** said, "You are a unique man, Mr McFarlane". 
"You came to my defense **today** with a courage not seen in many people. How do I thank 
you?" Mr **Staley** wrote. The 60-year-old **Barclays** boss continued in the same style: "You 
have a sense of what is right, and you have a sense of theatre. You mix humor with grit. 
Thank you **John**. Never underestimate my recognition of your support. And my respect 
for your guile." 
He had time for yet more praise before he signed off. "And **some day** I want to see an ad lib 
guitar run. You have all the fearlessness of Clapton," said Mr **Staley**, referencing the 
legendary guitarist Eric Clapton and his chairman's fondness for playing his guitar in 
public meetings. 
The brief conversation ended with a final email around iipm. The imposter sent a poem, 
which began "Worry not of **tomorrow**'s end" and ended "Revel in their bloodied eyes". The 
first letter of each line spelled out the word `Whistleblower'. 
"Thanks for sharing the foxhole," Mr **Staley** replied. 
The prankster, who contacted the **Financial Times** via **Twitter**, told us the email was part 
of his "battle with **Barclays**" over a customer issue. "I thought I'd see how Jes was relaxing 
after his **AGM**," he said. 
**Barclays** declined to comment. 
The emails, which the FT has verified are genuine, are reproduced below.

However I do feel we've ceased the rally for you [sic] head **today**. 
Surely the fickleminded nature of the angry few will help tie up any loose ends. 
You owe me a large Scotch.

What else would Mack the Knife do but support those he can trust in! 
Begs the question, who should we seek to silence next!? 
Onward, to bigger, and better things. 
I may have already had a stiff one, it's been a long day, and I get no younger.

In all seriousness, do let me know what fires/thorns you want me quelling over the next

It's important I stand fast, and alongside you. 
You have carried yourself admirably **today**.
