**Dear **Jeffrey****-
We are thrilled to announce that we are working with Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, one of the rising stars in 
the **New York** Congressional delegation. Sometimes referred to as "**Brooklyn**'s **Barack**", he is a staunch 
supporter of **President Obama** and a progressive voice for the people of ****New York** City**. NY1 did a profile piece 
about his work on the vitally important **Budget** and Judiciary committees in **Washington**. You can watch the  
video here  or read the text below. 
Hakeem is committed to electing a Democratic majority in **2014** and is encouraging his friends to participate in 
the DCCC/DSCC fundraising dinner with **President Obama** this coming Monday **night**. Shoot us an email or 
give us a call at (212) 531-2858 if you would like to get involved with the dinner, or would like to get an 
opportunity to get to know Hakeem better. He is an impressive guy and who will be a progressive voice in New 
York politics for **years** to come. 
Thanks, 
Darren Rigger, Lisa Rossi & Walter Swett

NY!: Hakeem Jeffries Positions Himself For Long Career In **Washington** 
Apr 29, **2013** 
By: Michael Scotto 
Hakeem Jeffries is only about four months into his freshman year in **Congress** but he's already positioning 
himself for a long career in **Washington**. NY 1 's Michael Scotto filed the following report. 
If you're looking to knock Hakeem Jeffries off message, you won't get very far. 
"There's a hip hop song, every day I'm hustling, and I kind of feel that way down here in **Washington**," Jeffries 
said. "In a positive manner, of course."

The freshman congressman from **Brooklyn** and a sliver of **Queens** is an ambitious work horse who always 
appears to have his eye on the prize. 
"I'll be shuffling back and forth between **Budget** and judiciary for the better part of the morning, making sure we 
time it correctly so that I'm able to ask questions in both situations," he said. 
He's a big change from Congressman Ed Towns, who retired after holding the seat for **30 **years****. 
On any given day, Jeffries is traveling through the Capitol, attending hearings on the Judiciary and **Budget** 
committees, two of the most prominent in the lower chamber. 
For Jeffries, those two assignments allow him to serve as a counterweight to the Republican leadership and to 
talk up the President, whom he and his district overwhelmingly support. 
"My job, I believe, is to help the administration of ****Barack** Obama** help us back at home," Jeffries said. 
In his first four months, Jeffries has championed himself as a progressive, introducing legislation to help student 
loan recipients and voting against a bill **Friday** to ease the impact of automatic spending cuts to the **FAA** 
because it didn't stop cuts to programs that are impacting the poor. 
In the months and **years** ahead, Jeffries says there's plenty to do. 
"There's no shortage of the people's business down in **Washington**, D.C. and that's why the job is one that is a 
serious endeavor," he said. 
A serious endeavor that is also very much on message.
