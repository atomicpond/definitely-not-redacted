﻿Filing # 37557658 E-Filed 02/08/**2016** 06:20:47 PM
IN THE CIRCUIT **Court** OF THE 17th
JUDICIAL CIRCUIT IN AND FOR
**Broward County**, **Florida**
CIVIL DIVISION
**Bradley J. Edwards**, and CASE NO. **CACE** 15-000072
**Paul G. Cassell**,
v.
Plaintiffs,
ALAN DERSHOWITZ,
Defendant.
/
RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT ALAN DERSHOWITZ’S MOTION FOR
CLARIFICATION OF CONFIDENTIALITY ORDER OR RELIEF FROM THAT ORDER
Non-Party **Virginia** Giuffre, by and through undersigned counsel, hereby responds to
Defendant Alan Dershowitz’s Motion for Clarification of Confidentiality Order or Relief From
that Order and states as follows:
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On November 12, 2015 this **Court** issued an Order granting in part, non-party **Virginia**
Giuffre’s Motion to Quash the subpoena served by Defendant Alan Dershowitz and ordered
protective limits relating to her deposition. **See Exhibit** A, November 12, 2015 Order. On
December 18, **2016**, this **Court** entered a Confidentiality Order holding that non-party **Virginia**
Giuffre’s deposition would be confidential. **See Exhibit** B, December 18, 2015 Confidentiality
Order. On January 16, **2016**, Ms. Giuffre testified at her deposition in accordance with this
**Court**’s Order. The deposition was labelled confidential in accordance with this **Court**’s Order.
As the **Court** knows, Ms. Giuffre was a victim of sexual trafficking when she was a minor child.
Indeed, the U.S. Attorney’s **Office for the Southern District of **Florida**** has specifically recognized
her as a “victim” of federal sex offenses. Unsurprisingly, her deposition contains highly sensitive
information about her experiences as a minor child, including detail descriptions of sexual crimes
committed against her.
ARGUMENT
1. Non-Party **Virginia** Giuffre Agrees That Her Deposition Should Be Provided
Confidentially To Law Enforcement to Investigate All The Crimes Committed
Against Her
Defendant Dershowitz seeks to have the **Court** grant an exception to the confidential nature
of the deposition so that it can be provided to the Office of the **State** Attorney and the Office of the
**United States** Attorney for investigative purposes. Specifically, Defendant Dershowitz states in
his motion that he is hoping to have law enforcement investigate whether Ms. Giuffre committed
perjury by stating in her previously filed affidavit that it is her recollection that she witnessed
former President Bill Clinton on Jeffrey Epstein’s island in **the **United States**** Virgin Islands
(“****USVI****”) 1 .
Setting aside Defendant Dershowitz’s baseless claims of perjury, Ms. Giuffre agrees that
her confidential deposition should be provided to law enforcement, including **the **United States****
Attorney and the **State** Attorney in each jurisdiction where any alleged crimes occurred so that
they may investigate all of the crimes committed against her when she was a minor child. To
ensure that **Justice** is served and that Defendant Dershowitz’s request is not just another charade
designed only to bully a sexual abuse victim, Ms. Giuffre asks the **Court** to impose the following
reasonable conditions relating to the disclosure:
�
Mr. Dershowitz agrees and is directed to cooperate with authorities and answer all
questions relating to the investigation of crimes against Ms. Giuffre.
1 Defendant Dershowitz conveniently ignores that publicly available flight logs of Jeffrey Epstein’s private
planes demonstrate that President Clinton travelled with Jeffrey Epstein and others to various locations
throughout the world including **Europe**, **Africa** and **Asia**. **See Exhibit** C, Excerpts of Flight Logs from
Jeffrey Epstein’s private plane.
2
�
�
�
�
Mr. Dershowitz agrees to make his client, Jeffrey Epstein, and others with relevant
testimony and with whom he has testified he shares a “common interest” – at least Epstein
and **Maxwell** – available to any law enforcement agency reviewing any alleged criminal
activities; or in the alternative, to attest to this **Court** that those necessary witnesses have
consented to full cooperation in the investigation Mr. Dershowitz is seeking permission to
initiate.
Mr. Dershowitz agrees to waive the statute of limitations in all jurisdictions for any
criminal conduct he participated in or was aware of relating to Ms. Giuffre so that law
enforcement can pursue any necessary charges. Defendant Dershowitz proclaimed that he
was willing to waive any statute of limitation for criminal conduct so this should not be an
issue. **See Exhibit** D, January 12, **2016** Deposition Transcript of Alan Dershowitz at 395.
“I had talked about the statute of limitations for criminal purpose was what I said, that I
would waive the statute of limitations for criminal purposes.”
Mr. Dershowitz agrees to provide the names and contact information for each **State**
Attorney and **United States** Attorney for which he has or is planning to provide
information relating to Ms. Giuffre; and agrees to jointly, with Ms. Giuffre’s counsel,
request that the **State** Attorney and **United States** Attorney, in the relevant jurisdictions,
investigate all potential criminal conduct. Both parties ma
