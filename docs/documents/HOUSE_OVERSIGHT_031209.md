**Epstein** building compound on Great St. James
By SUZANNE CARLSON **Daily News** Staff 6 hrs ago
A schematic filed with the Department of Planning and Natural Resources shows development plans for Great St.
James island.
ST. **THOMAS** —Wealthy sex o!ender Je!rey **Epstein** has been
quietly working for **years** to construct a new compound on
Great St. James island o! the East End of St. **THOMAS**, adding
to a massive real estate portfolio that also includes
neighboring Little St. James island, which has been his
primary residence for **decades**.
Je!rey **Epstein**
HOGP
V.I. Department of Planning and Natural Resources
spokesman Jamal Nielsen confirmed **Monday** that at least
some of that construction activity has been taking place
without permission from the government — the third time
in as many **years** that **Epstein** has gone beyond the scope of
permitted building plans.
“We have confirmed that there’s unauthorized work going on
at Great St. James, we have been in touch with the owners
and we are setting up to have a meeting with them soon, to
rectify this,” Nielsen said.

Nielsen could not say what specifically the unauthorized
work consists of, but said DPNR Commissioner nominee
Jean-Pierre Oriol would be available by phone **today** to
answer questions about the situation.
Documents on file at the Coastal Zone Management division
of DPNR show that **Epstein** used “Great St. Jim, **LLC**,” a shell
company organized by St. **THOMAS** attorney **Erika Kellerhals**,
to purchase three parcels totaling 80.1 acres from the Danish
Kjaer family for $17.5 million on Jan. 18, **2016**.
The remainder of the island — 12 parcels totaling 81.22 acres
— was transferred from another St. **THOMAS** company, GSJ
Properties Corp., to Great St. Jim **LLC** for $5 million on Jan.
21, **2016**.
While it’s long been rumored that **Epstein** had purchased
Great St. James, for **years** his name appeared nowhere on
publicly available documents listing property ownership of
the island.
The **Daily News** requested access to documents contained in
Coastal Zone Management permit application files for the
island on **April** 18, and was provided access to those records
**Monday**.
The documents show that in **2011**, Kellerhals, another
attorney in her firm, Gregory Ferguson, and business
consultant Brett Geary organized the St. **THOMAS** company
Poplar Inc.
A certificate of incumbency contained in the file lists **Epstein**
as president of Poplar Inc., his longtime lawyer Darren
Indyke is listed as vice president and secretary, and another
longtime associate, **Richard Kahn**, is listed as treasurer.
**The Daily Beast** reported in **April** that Kellerhals, Indyke, and
Kahn are listed as the only o"cers of other defunct
nonprofits run by **Epstein**, including the C.O.U.Q.
Foundation, J. **Epstein** **Virgin Islands** Foundation, and **Epstein**
Interests. They’re also listed as o"cers for Gratitude America
Ltd., a nonprofit formed in **the **Virgin Islands**** in **2012** through
which **Epstein** has made financial contributions to various
organizations.
The certificate specifically states that those individuals are
authorized to act on behalf of the corporation with respect to
all transactions, “including but not limited to transactions
related to permitting matters submitted on behalf of Great
St. Jim, **LLC**.”

Kellerhals organized Great St. Jim **LLC** on Oct. 26, 2015, with
herself as the sole member, and identified Geary’s company,
Business Basics VI **LLC**, as the resident agent.
Kellerhals could not be reached for comment **Monday**.
Documents contained in the permit application file show
that DPNR employees and **Epstein**’s sta! have been
communicating for **years** about the project.
“[H]i Erika, spoke with Je! **yesterday** and let him know that
the scopes of work from both applications are being
combined into one single permit. Dave of my sta! is
supposed to reach out to the LSJ [Little St. James] sta! and
arrange when he can make the required site visit. there are
some specific details that were not included in the
application package, so they will have to be verified during
the site visit and notes made on the submitted drawings,”
Oriol wrote to Kellerhals in an email dated Aug. 16, **2016**,
under the subject line, “RE: Cistern Permit.”
An email from DPNR legal counsel Michele Baker to
Kellerhals dated Aug. 26, **2016**, lists a number of documents
required for the permit applic
