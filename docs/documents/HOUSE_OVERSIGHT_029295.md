How's all in our crazy world? 
I'm in NY until **August 31** (then again, after **Beijing**, Sept. 25 — Oct. 14). If you are in town, meet? 
When convenient, I'd like you to meet ****PETER** Getzels**, **Closer To Truth** producer/director (I've worked with 
**PETER** for **12 years**); he would very much like to meet you in person, describe the **Radical Breakthroughs** 
process in detail, get your feedback. He would come up from DC. We can always do **Skype**, of course, but 
**PETER** would appreciate to meet in person early in the process. Breakthroughs is a Big Project, big opportunity 
for impact. All are truly excited. 
Below are highlights of Breakthroughs progress. 
Attached is latest **CNN** on trade war and below are links (caution: a few weeks old is ancient history in Trump 
time). 
The US trade war against **China**: The view from **Beijing**

How should **China** handle the trade war?

Radical Breakthrough Development Work 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 029295 
• Research on each of the 13 episodes is ongoing and we are moving towards creating a short list of the top 
contributors per episode (with some contributors in multiple episodes). 
• We are aggregating the top contributors around 4 to 5 central locations, such as SF **Bay Area**, LA, **Chicago**, 
**Boston**, **New York**, ****Santa Fe****, **London**, **Oxford**, and **Cambridge** for the main shoots. 
• We are creating a short list of locations for the secondary shoot - i.e. the more observational shoots on 
specific labs and research facilities, such as the Music Lab at McGill, the Sleep Lab at **Harvard**. 
• We are planning a recce in the autumn to assess locations and meet some of the key contributors. 
• We've brought on a production manager / line producer as we develop detailed research, contributors, 
locations, budgets. 
• Our team is working toward interviewing and hiring a top science-literate associate producer / dedicated 
research producer. We've been coordinating with colleagues at HHMI (Howard Hughes Medical Association) 
as well as **National Geographic** for staffing referrals, and now have a strong short list. This is a critical, long-
term position. 
• We are assessing graphics and animation companies and researching styles and graphic ideas that we might 
use to communicate some of the more complex ideas. 
• Our digital team is researching a web extension for the www.closertotruth.com website, developing ideas for 
a dedicated site neighborhood for "**Radical Breakthroughs**." We are in discussions with several website 
design companies, including the company that designed and built our original **CTT** site, for ideas and bids on 
creating the expanded site. 
• By **mid-October**, we expect to begin to schedule the shoots.
