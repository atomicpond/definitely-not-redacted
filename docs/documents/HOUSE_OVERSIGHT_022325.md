Budgets, tax reform and “extenders”
As **the year** winds down, **HOUSE** Budget Committee Chairman **Paul Ryan** (R-WI) and **Senate** Budget
Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D-WA) have hammered out a budget deal that forestalls – for **two years**
– another government shutdown, and limits some of the forthcoming sequester cuts otherwise slated to go in
effect in **January**. Although neither negotiator is entirely happy with the agreement, both view it as a
workable cease-fire in the budget battles; the **HOUSE** passed the agreement 332 to 94 on **December** 12 th ,
and the **Senate** passed it 64 to 36 on **December** 18 th . **President Obama** will sign the bill shortly, thereby
making it possible for **Congress** to draft spending bills so as to allocate the budget dollars that have now
been approved. Note, however, that this budget agreement does not address the debt ceiling suspension,
which expires in **February**, and that another fiscal showdown is therefore possible **early next year**.
As to tax reform, Sen. **Max Baucus** (D-MT), Chairman of the **Senate** Finance Committee, has recently put
forth several discussion drafts of legislation, generally dealing with corporate and international tax, and
energy incentives, while Rep. **Dave Camp** (R-MI), Chairman of the ****HOUSE** Ways** and **Means Committee**,
acknowledged that he fell short on his goal of introducing tax reform legislation **this year**, but that he would
rather focus on that than an “extenders” bill.
What is “extenders” legislation, and how might it fit into the tax reform puzzle? Although “extenders” are not
defined anywhere, they generally refer to temporary provisions of the tax law that **Congress** regularly renews
– usually for **a year** or two at a time. For example, the research and development credit is an important
business incentive that has been around since 1981 – and is again among the extenders that expire on
**December** 31, 2013 (**this year**, they number 57). Some of the other extenders on this list are more recent,
including the $250 above-the-line deduction for certain out-of-pocket expenses of teachers, the deduction for
state and local sales taxes, and the IRA charitable “rollover” provision for taxpayers who are at least 70½.
Why does the tax law have so many temporary provisions? Several reasons come to mind. If a provision
was enacted in response to a natural disaster or specific crisis, it is theoretically a short-term measure
designed to get taxpayers through a particularly difficult period – such as the expiring extender dealing with
mortgage forgiveness. Enacted at the end of 2007 in response to turmoil in the housing market, this
provision was designed to help borrowers who were underwater with their home mortgages: previously, if a
lender foreclosed on a home and sold it for less than the outstanding indebtedness, the forgiveness of the
unpaid balance generated taxable income for the borrower, as did a renegotiated mortgage that reduced the
outstanding indebtedness. Under this temporary provision, that forgiveness is not considered income – a
welcome result for taxpayers in this unhappy situation.
Yet what about temporary provisions that promote favored tax policies but that don’t respond to a particular
situation? If they’re such a good idea, why not make them permanent? This gets to a basic reality:
permanent provisions are more costly than temporary ones. That is because the Joint Committee on
Taxation must use a current law “baseline” when it estimates the revenue impact of tax legislation. Such a
baseline assumes that a temporary measure, such as the mortgage forgiveness mentioned above,
generates only a short-term revenue loss, and will expire as scheduled – even if that is unlikely to occur.
This means that such measures can paint a rosier fiscal picture than is perhaps justified, and can therefore
be a more “cost-effective” way to continue desired tax benefits (and policies), regardless of how inefficient
and counter-productive the resulting uncertainty may be.
These current expiring extenders seem likely to languish – at least for a bit, especially considering that the
**HOUSE** has already recessed for **the year**. Although **Congress** has often renewed expiring provisions
retroactively, such a move **early next year** could take some of the steam out of tax reform (assuming it has a
chance). In addition, despite how inherently worthy these expiring provisions may be, **Congress** is under
less pressure to pass extenders legislation because of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of **2012** (ATRA)
(Pub. L. 112-240). That is, in addition to making most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, ATRA,
which was enacted on **January** 2, 2013, made the “granddaddy” of extenders permanent, by permanently
indexing the AMT exemption for inflation, thereby permanently sparing over 25+ million taxpayers from the
AMT, as opposed to the “mere” 4+ million currently affected by it (recall that the earliest incarnation o
