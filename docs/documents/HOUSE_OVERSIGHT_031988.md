Inside Job (**2010**) 
**NYT** Critics' PickThis movie has been designated a Critic's Pick by the film reviewers of The **New York** 
Times. 
**Sony Pictures Classics** 
Henry Paulson, **Ben Bernanke** and **Timothy Geithner** in the documentary "Inside Job." 
Who Maimed the Economy, and How 
By A. 0. **Scott** 
"Inside Job," a sleek, briskly paced film whose title suggests a heist movie, is the story of a crime 
without punishment, of an outrage that has so far largely escaped legal sanction and societal stigma. The 
betrayal of public trust and collective values that Mr. **Ferguson** chronicles was far more brazen and 
damaging than the adultery in Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel, which treated Hester more as scapegoat than 
villain. 
The gist of this movie, which begins in a mood of calm reflection and grows angrier and more incredulous 
as it goes on, is unmistakably punitive. The density of information and the complexity of the subject 
matter make "Inside Job" feel like a classroom lecture at times, but by the end Mr. **Ferguson** has summoned 
the scourging moral force of a pulpit-shaking sermon. That he delivers it with rigor, restraint and good 
humor makes his case all the more devastating. 
He is hardly alone in making it. Numerous journalists have published books and articles retracing the 
paths that led the world economy to the precipice **two years ago**. The deregulation of the financial 
services industry in the 1980s and '90s; the growing popularity of complex and risky derivatives; the 
real estate bubble and the explosion of subprime lending — none of these developments were exactly 
secret. On the contrary, they were celebrated as vindications of the power and wisdom of markets. 
Accordingly, Mr. **Ferguson** recycles choice moments of triumphalism, courtesy of **Lawrence H. **Summers****, 
**George W. **Bush****, **Alan Greenspan** and various cable television ranters and squawkers. 
Even as stock indexes soared and profits swelled, there were always at least a few investors, economists 
and government officials who warned that the frenzied speculation was leading to the abyss. Some of these 
prophets without honor show up in front of Mr. **Ferguson**'s camera, less to gloat than to present, once 
again, the analyses that were dismissed and ignored by their peers for so long. 
Dozens of interviews — along with news clips and arresting aerial shots of **New York**, **Iceland** and other 
disaster areas — are folded into a clear and absorbing history, narrated by **Matt Damon**. The music (an 
opening song, "Big Time," by **Peter Gabriel**, and a score by Alex Heffes) and the clean wide-screen 
cinematography provide an aesthetic polish that is welcome for its own sake and also important to the 
movie's themes. The handsomely lighted and appointed interiors convey a sense of the rarefied, privileged 
worlds in which the Wall Street operators and their political enablers flourished, and the elegance of 
the presentation also subliminally bolsters the film's authority. This is not a piece of ragged 
muckraking or breathless advocacy. It rests its outrage on reason, research and careful argument. 
The same was true of Mr. **Ferguson**'s previous documentary, "No End in Sight," which focused on 
catastrophic policies carried out in **Iraq** by President ****George W. **Bush****'s** administration just after the 
overthrow of **Saddam Hussein**. But whereas that film concentrated on a narrow view of a complex subject — 
the conduct of the war rather than the at least equally controversial rationale for fighting it — "Inside 
Job" offers a sweeping synthesis, going as far back as the **Reagan** administration and as far afield as 
**Iceland** in its anatomy of the financial crisis. 
Perhaps unsurprisingly, many of the highest-profile players declined to be interviewed. Mr. **Summers** 
appears only in news footage, and none of his predecessors or successors as **Treasury** secretary — not 
Robert E. Rubin or Henry M. Paulson Jr. or Timothy F. Geithner — submit to Mr. **Ferguson**'s questions. Nor 
do any of the top executives at **Goldman Sachs** or the other big banks. Most of the interviewees are, at 
least from the perspective of the filmmaker, friendly witnesses, adding fuel to the director's 
comprehensive critique of the way business has been done in **the United States** and the other advanced 
capitalist countries for **the past two decades**. 
Both American political parties are indicted; "Inside Job" is not simply another belated settling of 
accounts with Mr. **Bush** and his advisers, though they are hardly ignored. The scaling back of government 
oversight and the weakening of checks on speculative activity by banks began under **Reagan** and continued 
during the **CLINTON** administration. And with each administration the market in derivatives expanded, and 
alarms about the dangers of this type of investment were ignored. Raghuram Rajan, chief economist at the 
**International Monetary Fund**, presented a paper in **2005** warning o
