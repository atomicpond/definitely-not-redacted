Results 
Importance: **High 
Jeffrey**, 
The bats did the sweep. Here are the new results taken as of a minute ago. 
You have only one negative article left on front page of **Google**, which is 
**The ****Huffington** Post**** article. **The ****Huffington** Post**** is extremely hard to 
move, because it is so powerful, has millions of links to it, and uploads 
massive new and original content it on a **daily** basis with posting from out 
side readers. We managed to push it down the page, as it used to be at the 
top. If we were able to post original content to both the science and the 
org site (absolutely not a single word to **this day** by Jessica, just talk), 
we would have been able to push it down even further, and off the page. WE 
did manage to get rid of the **daily** beast article, which is now far 
removed, inspite of their own efforts to keep it prominent. 
Toxic suggested search engine terms that popped up automatically when you 
typed in your name are also now removed. 
Wikipedia was an important victory, as it will always be at the top of the 
search engine results. ow the head lines do not mention convicted sex 
offender or pedophile. Instead, **Philanthrophic** work, **Epstein Foundation**, 
**Promotion of Scientists**. We have stopped the hacking on your wiki site, 
and that was a major effor. Your wiki entry now is pretty tame, and bad 
stuff has been muted, bowlerized, and pused to the bottom. Careful editing 
and wording has muted the effect immensely. We hacked the site to replace 
the mug shot and caption, and now has an entirely different photo and 
caption. This was a big success. 
We pushed the **Edge** all the way up to the front page, where it was 
previously buried on page 5 of **Google** search. 
We have promoted the other jeffrey epsteins, and other pages are also 
filled with your material. 
And, while the sites are up, and in the direction we hoped, they are still 
new, and subject to volitility, especially if new original content is not 
added on a minimum of a **weekly** basis. I have been forbideen to add new 
content to the **Philanthrophic** site as well as the science site, and 
therefore, as a result our rating slipped down (still on the first page, 
but would have liked them (and some of the articles to been able to push 
**Huffington** off page). We also helped with you images, and the first images 
that come of you on a **Google** search are not of your mug shot, etc. 
Your **daily** beast foe is still at it, and trying to promote her sites 
against you in the same way that we try to depromote you. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 022216 
As far as this site is concerned, and the continuation of this, I do not 
know what you wish to do. Clearly, you have no interest in my continuing. 
And, I am not sure if you want to continue the project at all. If the 
latter, and you stop, eventually it will just go into the way of entropy, 
and it will return to the old form. The major work has been done, but it 
needs to be maintained. For it to get better results, it needs to have 
constant input and supervision, and that means generating proper content, 
not just editing and grammatical fixes. Writers need to know what to 
write. THe philanthrophy site is at the bottom of the page precisely 
because you have not allowed us to add any content to it, and as a result 
it suffers. 
You paid **Mike $**2500, which he applied for the purchasing of his 
replacement servers, but his fee of $7500 balance is now due if you want 
to continue. Please let me know what you want to do. I need to inform him, 
and if you are not going to use him, he needs to take on his other clients 
and devote his time there. 
This needs to be contrasted with what we started with, which was a search 
on your name, which had nine/10 very toxic prominent stories, and toxic 
Wiki article and headline.
