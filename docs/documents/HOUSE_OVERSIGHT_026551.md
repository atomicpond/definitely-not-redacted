AN FP SPECIAL REPORT 
The Ayatollah Under the  
Bed(sheets)  
In ****the **Islamic Republic**** of Iran**, all politics may not be sexual, but all sex is political. 
BY KARIM SADJADPOUR I MAY/JUNE 2012  
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026551 
In **the early years** of the Iranian Revolution, an obscure cleric named Ayatollah Gilani 
became a sensation on state television by contemplating bizarre hypotheticals at the 
intersection of Islamic law and sexuality. One of his most outlandish scenarios -- still 
mocked by Iranians three decades later -- went like this: 
Imagine you are a young man sleeping in your bedroom. In the bedroom directly below, 
your aunt lies asleep. Now imagine that an earthquake happens that collapses your floor, 
causing you to fall directly on top of her. For the sake of argument, let's assume that you're 
both nude, and you're erect, and you land with such perfect precision on top of her that 
you unintentionally achieve intercourse. Is the child of such an 
encounter halalzadeh (legitimate) or haramzadeh (a bastard)? 
Such tales of random ribaldry may sound anomalous in the seemingly austere, asexual 
**Islamic Republic** of Iran. But the "Gili Show," as it came to be known, had quite the 
following among both the traditional classes, who were titillated by his taboo topics, and 
the Tehrani elite, who tuned in for comic relief. Gilani helped spawn what is now a virtual 
cottage industry of clerics and fundamentalists turned amateur sexologists offering 
incoherent advice on everything from quickies ("The man's goal should be to lighten his 
load as soon as possible without arousing his woman") to masturbation ("a grave, grave 
sin which causes scientific and medical harm").

Perhaps it's not entirely surprising that Iran's Shiite fundamentalists -- not unlike their 
evangelical Christian, Catholic, Orthodox Jewish, and **Sunni Muslim** counterparts -- spend 
an inordinate amount of time pondering sexuality. They are human, after all. But the 
sexual manias of Iran's religious fundamentalists are worthy of greater scrutiny, all the 
more so because they control a state with nuclear ambitions, vast oil wealth, and a young, 
dynamic, stifled population. Yet for a variety of reasons -- fear of becoming **Salman 
Rushdie**, of being labeled an Orientalist, of upsetting religious sensibilities -- the 
remarkable hypocrisy of the Iranian regime is often studiously avoided. 
That's a mistake. Because religion is politics in a theocracy like Iran, uninformed or 
antiquated notions of sexuality aren't just confined to the bedroom -- they pervade the 
country's seminaries, military barracks, boardrooms, courtrooms, and classrooms. A 
common aphorism among Iranians is that before the revolution, people partied outside 
the home and prayed inside, while today they pray outside and party inside. This reverse 
dichotomy is true of a lot of social behavior in Iran. For many Iranians, this perverse state 
of affairs is now so ingrained, such an inherent aspect of daily interactions with Iranian 
officialdom, that it is no longer noteworthy. For those in the West who seek to better 
understand what makes **Tehran** tick, though, the regime's curious fixation on sex cannot 
be ignored. 
To paraphrase the late U.S. House Speaker Tip O'Neill, in ****the **Islamic Republic**** of Iran** 
all politics may not be sexual, but all sex is political. Exhibit A is the revolution's father, the 
late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Like all Shiite clerics aspiring to become a "source of 
emulation" (marja'-e taqlid), Khomeini spent the first part of his career meticulously 
examining and dispensing religious guidance on personal behavior and ritual purity that 
ranged from the mundane ("It is recommended not to hold back the need to urinate or 
defecate, especially if it hurts") to the surprisingly lewd. 
In his 1961 religious treatise A Clarification of Questions (Towzih al-Masael), Khomeini 
issued detailed pronouncements on issues ranging from sodomy ("If a man sodomizes 
the son, brother, or father of his wife after their marriage, the marriage remains valid") to 
bestiality ("If a person has intercourse with a cow, a sheep, or a camel, their urine and 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026553 
dung become impure and drinking their milk will be unlawful"). As a young boy growing 
up in the American **Midwest**, I remember being both horrified and bewildered after 
coming across these precise passages in a translated volume of Khomeini's sayings I found 
in our Persian emigre home. 
Scholars of Shiism -- including harsh critics of Khomeini -- emphasize that such themes 
were the norm among clerics of Khomeini's generation and should be understood
