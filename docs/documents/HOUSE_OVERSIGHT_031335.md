DOMINQUE STRAUSS-KAHN ARRESTED, NOT BECAUSE HE RAPED A MAID, BUT 
BECAUSE HE HAD EVIDENCE US HAS NO GOLD IN FORT KNOX.

V.4110". 
A startling story published by the European Union Times, could be the one of the worlds biggest conspiracy theories, a plot for a movie or a 
frightening scenario for the U.S. and world economy. 
Dominique **strauss Kahn** 
According to the on-line publication a new report prepared for Russian Prime Minister **Putin** by the FederalSecurity Service(**FSB**) says that 
former **International Monetary Fund** (**IMF**) ChiefDominique Strauss-Kahnwas charged and jailed in the US forsex crimeson **May 14** after his 
discovery that all of thegoldheld in theUnited States Bullion Depositorylocated at Fort Knox was missing and/or unaccounted for. 
According to this FSBsecretreport, Strauss-Kahn had become increasingly concerned **Earlier this month** after **the United States** began stalling 
its pledged delivery to the **IMF** of191.3 tons of goldagreed to under theSecond Amendmentof the Articles of Agreement signed by the 
Executive Board in April 1978 that were to be sold to fund what are called Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) as an alternative to what are called 
reserve currencies. 
This **FSB** report says that when Strauss-Kahn raised his concerns with Americangovernment officials close to President Obama he was 
contacted by rogue elements within the **CIA** who provided him firm evidence that all of thegoldreported to be held by the US was gone. 
Upon Strauss-Kahn receiving the **CIA** evidence, the report said, he made immediate arrangements to leave the US for **Paris**, but when 
contacted by agents working for Frances General Directorate for External Security (DGSE) that American authorities were seeking his 
capture he fled to **New York** CitysJFK airportfollowing these agents directive not to take his cell-phone because US police could track his 
exact location. 
Once Strauss-Kahn safely boarded anAir **France** flightto **Paris**, the **FSB** report says, he made a fatal mistake by calling the hotel from a phone 
on the plane and asking them to forwarded the cell-phone he had been told to leave behind to his French residence, after which US agents 
were able to track and apprehend him. 
Within the past fortnight, the report continues, Strauss-Kahn reached out to his close friend and top Egyptian banker Mahmoud Abdel Salam 
Omar to retrieve from the US the evidence given to him by the **CIA**. Omar, however, and exactly like Strauss-Kahn before him, has been 
chargedby the US with a sex crime against aluxury hotelmaid, a charge the **FSB** labels as beyond belief as Omar is 74-**years**-old and a devout 
Muslim. 
In an astounding move puzzling many in **Moscow**, **Putin** after reading thissecretFSB report ordered posted to the Kremlins official website a 
defense of Strauss-Khan becoming thefirst world leader to state that the former **IMF** chief was a victim of a US conspiracy. 
One of **the United States** top Congressman, and **2012** Presidential candidate, Ron **Paul** has long stated his belief that the US government has 
lied about itsgoldreserves held at Fort Knox. And in **2010** put forward a bill force an audit of them, .The bill was defeated,but which was 
subsequently defeated by Obama regime forces. 
When directly asked by reporters if he believed there was nogoldin Fort Knox or **the Federal Reserve**, Congressman **Paul** gave the incredible 
reply, I think it is a possibility. 
Also interesting to note is that barely 3 days after the arrest of Strauss-Kahn, Congressman **Paul** made a new call for the US to sell 
itsgoldreserves by stating, Given the high price it is now, and the tremendous debt problem we now have, by all means, sell at the peak. 
Reports emanating from the US for **years**, however, suggest there is nogoldto sell. 
New reports coming from **the United States** show his determination not to go down without a fight as he has hired what is described as a 
crack team of former **CIA** spies, private investigators and media advisers to defend him. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 031335 
Ob **Monday** Russias Central Bank yesterdayordered the interest rateraised from 0.25 to 3.5 percent and **Putin** ordered the export ban on 
wheat and grain cropslifted by July lin a move designed to fill Russias coffers with money that normally would have flowed to the US.
