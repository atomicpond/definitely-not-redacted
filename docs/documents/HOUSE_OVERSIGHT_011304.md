                                                                 2

     H3VOGIU1



 1            (Case called)



 2            THE COURT:  Like all of you, you woke up in the middle



 3   of the night thinking about this case.  I would like to see if



 4   I can clarify my understanding.



 5            In the motion to dismiss, I concluded, I think, that



 6   what was at issue was the truth or falsity of the plaintiff's



 7   allegations concerning sexual abuse and the activities of the



 8   defendant.  I think that's my sense of my own opinion.



 9            Yesterday, we were discussing the redactions of the



10   intervention motion.  I got the sense, perhaps wrongly, that



11   the plaintiff's position was that the defamation was the truth



12   or falsity of the statements relating to the defendant.



13   Period.  Am I correct?



14            MS. McCAWLEY:  You are, your Honor, in that the



15   statements about the defendant -- to be clear, because one of



16   the allegations is, of course, she was a madam and a



17   coconspirator with Epstein -- do involve Epstein.



18            THE COURT:  Listen.  Leave the pejorative out.  Okay?



19   Please.



20            MS. McCAWLEY:  Sure.



21            THE COURT:  Simply because I'm trying to come to



22   grips, obviously, with the scope of this case, which is a real



23   issue, obviously.  So is it you are restricting your claim to



24   the truth and falsity of the statements about Maxwell?



25            MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes, that is the case, your Honor.  The



                    **Southern District** REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300


                                                                 3

     H3VOGIU1



 1   statements about Maxwell and her activities, without using any



 2   description of what that is, but yes, as we've described in our



 3   pleadings.



 4            THE COURT:  And whether or not the plaintiff was



 5   subject to sexual abuse as a minor is not part of it.  I mean,



 6   yes, of course, whatever she was when whatever, but that issue



 7   we don't have to deal with.



 8            MS. McCAWLEY:  I'm sorry, your Honor.  I think I lost



 9   you there.  I apologize.



10            So the allegations in the complaint are that when our



11   client came forward and said she was abused by the defendant



12   and Epstein, the defendant came out and said she was lying



13   about that abuse, and some of that abuse did occur when she was



14   a minor.



15            THE COURT:  Yes.  Well, okay.  But there are other



16   things that she sets forth in the Churcher articles, in the



17   motion to intervene, there are a whole series of other things



18   that are -- I mean, there are things that have been said, and



19   my reading of the defendant's statement is, I read it to say



20   all those things are false.  But those are not at issue, as far



21   as you're concerned.



22            MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes, your Honor.  In fact, the omnibus



23   motion we filed today -- and I think, if I'm following you



24   correctly, this may help -- we were trying to streamline the



25   case because there's other individuals, obviously, that my



                    **Southern District** REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300

 1   client made statements about.  So we were trying to streamline



 2   the case to the statements about Maxwell and her involvement
