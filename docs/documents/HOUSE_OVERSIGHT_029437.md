you and Chapman 
Dear Daniale 1.04.18.doc 
Importance: High 
attached a message i just sent to President Struppa of Chapman—i am certain that your gift will do the trick—
and that **the **West Coast**** is indeed more convivial and supportive than the **East** 
i hope i did not f... up your contact with Finkelstein 
Carlos told me of the devastation to your island—pretty much as i feared 
am amused (at a safe distance) as Bannon takes on **Trump**—he responds as he always does, threatening a suit he 
will not in fact file 
no internet in my home or nearby in the great, retarded country of **Jamaica** so i am now at a restaurant some 35 
minutes away and only go on-line twice a day—hoping that i will work instead 
all best
