Fwd: Statement for Press

Subject: Statement for Press 
Alan Dershowitz's Statement: We can now prove that **Jane Doe** #3 has no credibility and lied  
about **CLINTON**, the Gores and Dershowitz.  
Dershowitz's lawyers have filed a detailed reply to **Jane Doe** #3 false charges. In it they definitively 
respond to all of the alleged evidence presented by **Jane Doe** #3 and her lawyers. Since that filing **Mr. 
Dershowitz**'s lawyers have uncovered additional evidence that **Jane Doe** #3 has lied about her 
alleged contacts with fonner **President **CLINTON**** and former Vice President Gore and the then **Mrs. 
Gore**. In her first affidavit to the court she repeats the claim that she had earlier sold to a British 
tabloid: namely that "former President **BILL** **CLINTON** was present on the **Island** [******Jeffrey** **Epstein****'s** 
private **Island**] at a time when [**Jane Doe** #3] was also present on the **Island**." 
This statement, sworn under oath, summarizes a far more elaborate fantasy that she sold to a British 
tabloid which has since been repeated by the international media. In neither statement, does she 
provide any specific dates or times, but she does weave an imaginative fantasy about her fictional 
meeting with former **President **CLINTON****. She "describes" how Mr. **CLINTON**'s **Secret Service** detail 
allowed ********Ghislaine**** **Maxwell******, then a novice helicopter pilot, to fly the former President to **Epstein**'s 
private **Island** on a large black helicopter — an obvious lie. She then purports to "describe" specific 
seating locations at a fictional dinner party that included her, Mr. **CLINTON**, ****Jeffrey** **Epstein**** and two 
other underage "olive-skinned brunettes" whose identities she could not provide: 
"I flew to the **Caribbean** with **Jeffrey** and then ********Ghislaine**** **Maxwell****** went to pick up **BILL** in a huge black 
helicopter that **Jeffrey** had bought her. She'd always wanted to fly and **Jeffrey** paid for her to take 
lessons, and I remember she was very excited because she got her licence around **the first year** we 
met. I used to get frightened flying with her but **BILL** had **the **Secret Service**** with him and I remember 
him talking about what a good job she did. I only ever met **BILL** twice but **Jeffrey** had told me that 
they were good friends. I asked, "How come?" and he laughed and said, "He owes me some 
favours." Maybe he was just joking but it constantly surprised me that people with as much to lose as 
**BILL** and [Prince] Andrew weren't more careful. She said that when dining that night, **Maxwell** sat at 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 029225 
**President **CLINTON****'s left, while they were joined by two 'olive-skinned brunettes' who had been flown 
in from **New York**... 
I'd never met them before. I'd say they were no older than 17, very innocent-looking. 
They weren't there for me. They weren't there for **Jeffrey** or ****Ghislaine**** because I was there to have sex 
with **Jeffrey** on the trip. 
Maybe **Jeffrey** thought they would entertain **BILL**, but I saw no evidence that he was interested in 
them. He and **Jeffrey** and ****Ghislaine**** seemed to have a very good relationship. **BILL** was very funny. 
He made me laugh a few times. And he and **Jeffrey** and ****Ghislaine**** told blokey jokes and the brunettes 
listened politely and giggled. 
After dinner I gave **Jeffrey** an erotic massage. I don't remember seeing **BILL** again on the trip but I 
assume ****Ghislaine**** flew him back..." 
**Jane Doe** #3 also concocted another meeting with a powerful political figure for the British tabloid, 
this time claiming to have met former Vice President Gore and his then wife, Tipper, on the same 
**Island**, again providing no specific dates or times, but only personal interest details designed to 
enhance the value of her fictional account 
"[**Jane Doe** #3} disclosed that Mr **CLINTON**'s vice-president **Al Gore** and his wife, Tipper, were also 
guests of **Epstein** on his **Island**... 'I had no clue that anything was up,' [**Jane Doe** #3] says. 'The Gores 
seemed like a beautiful couple when I met them. All I knew was that Mr Gore was a friend of 
**Jeffrey**'s and ****Ghislaine****'s. **Jeffrey** didn't ask me to give him a massage... There might have been a 
couple of other girls there on that trip but I could never have imagined this guy would do anything 
wrong. I was planning to vote for him when I turned 18. I thought he was awesome." 
These fabrications, which are obvious on their face, could easily have been determined to be false by 
any reasonable investigation. Our investigation has turned up evidence that Mr. **CLINTON** was never 
on Mr. **Epstein**'s **Island**, that neither Mr. Gore, nor his former wife, have ever been on the **Island**, and 
that Mr. and Mrs. Gore do not even know Mr. **Epstein**. **Jane Doe** #3's salaciously detailed accounts, 
sold for money to a tabloid are made up and were purposely designed to titillate the interests of 
readers eage
