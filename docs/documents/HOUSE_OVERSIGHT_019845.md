When It Comes to Wall Street, Preet Bharara Is No 
Hero 
The prominent U.S. attorney fired by Donald **Trump** **this weekend** has 
been justly acclaimed for his pursuit of political corruption. But his 
treatment of the Wall Street executives involved in the financial meltdown 
was far less confrontational.

_____Preet Bharara, then U.S. attorney for **the **Southern District**** of New York, at **Trump** 
Tower in **November 2016** (Drew Angerer/**Getty Images**) 
After his election in **1968**, President Richard Nixon asked Robert Morgenthau, the US 
Attorney for **the **Southern District**** of New York, to resign. Morgenthau refused to leave 
voluntarily, saying it degraded the office to treat it as a patronage position. 
Nixon's move precipitated a political crisis. The president named a replacement. Powerful 
politicians lined up to support Morgenthau. Morgenthau had taken on mobsters and power 
brokers. He had repeatedly prosecuted Roy Cohn, the sleazy New York lawyer who had 
been Senator Joe McCarthy's right-hand man. (One of Cohn's clients and protégés was a 
young **New York City** real estate developer named Donald **Trump**.) When Cohn complained 
that Morgenthau had a vendetta against him, Morgenthau replied, "A man is not immune 
from prosecution merely because a **United States** Attorney happens not to like him." 
Morgenthau carried that confrontational attitude to the world of business. He pioneered the 
**Southern District**'s approach to corporate crime. When his prosecutors took on corporate

fraud, they did not reach settlements that called for fines, the current fashion **these days**. 
They filed criminal charges against the executives responsible. 
Before Morgenthau, **the Department of Justice** focused on two-bit corporate misdeeds 
**Ponzi** schemes and boiler room operations. Morgenthau changed that. His prosecutors went 
after CEOs and their enablers___the accountants and lawyers who abetted the frauds or 
looked the other way. "How do you justify prosecuting a nineteen-year old who sells drugs 
on a street corner when you say it's too complicated to go after the people who move the 
money?" he once asked. 
Morgenthau's **years** as **United States** Attorney were followed by political success. He was 
elected New York County District Attorney in **1974**, the first of seven consecutive terms for 
that office. 
There are parallels between Morgenthau, and Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for the 
**Southern District** who was fired by **President **Trump**** **this weekend**. 
Like Morgenthau, the 48-year old Bharara leaves the office of US Attorney for the Southern 
District celebrated for taking on corrupt and powerful politicians. Bharara prosecuted two of 
the infamous "three men in a room" who ran New York state: Sheldon Silver, the 
Democratic speaker of the assembly and Dean Skelos, the Republican **Senate** majority 
leader. 
He won convictions of a startling array of local politicians, carrying on the work of the 
Moreland Commission, an ethics inquiry created and then dismissed by **New York's** Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo. (**this weekend**, Bharara cryptically tweeted that "I know what the 
Moreland Commission must have felt like," a suggestion that he was fired as he was 
pursuing cases pointed at **Trump** or his allies.) 
But the record shows that Bharara was much less aggressive when it came to confronting 
Wall Street's misdeeds. 
**President Obama** appointed Bharara in **2009**, amid the wreckage of the worst financial crisis 
since the Great Depression. He inherited ongoing investigations into the collapse, including 
a probe against ****Lehman** Brothers**. 
He also inherited something he and his young charges found more alluring: insider-trading 
cases against hedge fund managers. His office focused obsessively on those. At one point, 
**the **Southern District**** racked up a record of 85-0 in those cases. (Appeals courts would later 
throw out two prominent convictions, infuriating him and dealing blows to several other 
cases.) 
Hedge funds are safer targets. The firms aren't enmeshed in the global financial markets in 
the way that giant banks are. Insider trading cases are relatively easy to win and don't 
address systemic abuses that helped bring down the financial system. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 019846 
Even there his record was more mixed than is popularly understood. As Sheelah Kolhatkar 
demonstrates in her propulsive and riveting "Black Edge," when it came to bringing his 
biggest whale to justice, Steve Cohen of SAC Capital, **the **Southern District**** blinked. They 
did not charge him, only securing a guilty plea from his firm. 
Present and former prosecutors say Bharara d
