﻿Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 306 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/02/2015 Page 1 of 19
**Jane Doe** #1 AND **Jane Doe** #2,
vs.
Plaintiffs,
**United States** OF AMERICA,
**United States** DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF **Florida**
Case No. 08-80736-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON
Defendant.
________________________________________/
REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION
FOR LIMITED INTERVENTION BY ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ
Alan M. Dershowitz hereby replies in support of his Motion for Limited Intervention (DE
282). Prof. Dershowitz’s only interest in joining this case is to strike the false, sensational and
irrelevant allegations against him. In its response (DE 290), the government compellingly set
forth the many reasons why **Jane Does** #3 and #4’s request, filed over 6 years after the
commencement of the CVRA case, should be denied. **Jane Doe** #3’s false allegations against
Prof. Dershowitz were not included in her statement to the government, were not made to the
FBI when she was initially contacted by that agency, were not included in her civil action against
Epstein in 2009, were not included in her recorded interview with her attorneys in 2011 and were
not included in her interview with the British press in 2011. These allegations first appeared in
**Jane Doe** #3’s Motion for Joinder in **December 2014** (DE 279), and therefore have absolutely no
relevance as to whether there was a CVRA violation when Epstein and the government executed
**the Non-Prosecution Agreement** in **September 2007**. The request for limited intervention was
initiated to give Dershowitz a voice in the proceedings if and only if the Court allowed the
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 306 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/02/2015 Page 2 of 19
joinder of ****Jane Doe** 3** and her untimely allegations to the underlying CVRA case. If the Court
rejects the pending motion for joinder (DE 279), then the Court should strike the scurrilous
allegations against Dershowitz, or, alternatively, determine the possible mootness of his Motion
for Limited Intervention. Of course, if the Court strikes the allegations against him sua sponte,
Prof. Dershowitz will withdraw his motion for limited intervention. However, if the Court grants
**Jane Does** #3 and #4’s motion for joinder, then Prof. Dershowitz’s motion for limited
intervention should be granted for such purposes as may be appropriate including submitting a
motion to strike or other relief, so as to give him an opportunity to defend himself against these
malicious and false allegations. In support of his Reply in Support of his Motion for Limited
Intervention, Prof. Dershowitz states as follows:
Despite swearing under oath to her falsehoods about Prof. Dershowitz, **Jane Doe** #3
struggles to justify her defamations as having any relevance to the issues in this proceeding. Her
Response to Prof. Dershowitz’s Motion for Limited Intervention (DE 291) (herein “Response”)
offers no legitimate reason for defaming Prof. Dershowitz in her Joinder Motion, and she has no
right to continue to do so in this Court. Strikingly, the Response does not explain why **Jane Doe**
#3, with an obvious financial motive for fabrication of salacious accusations, waited almost
**seven years** to lob a stink bomb into a proceeding in which she has no right to participate. The
Response does not account for why **Jane Doe** #3 never once asserted her accusations about Prof.
Dershowitz until **a month ago**, even though the alleged transgressions supposedly occurred some
fifteen years ago. Although neither **Jane Doe** #3 nor anyone else had previously asserted any
improper sexual contact with Prof. Dershowitz, now **Jane Doe** #3 cynically exploits the yoke of
victimhood to victimize others.

At bottom, **Jane Doe** #3’s Response is nothing but a paper-thin pastiche of conspiracy
theory and outright misrepresentation that crumbles upon examination. Invocations of the Fifth
Amendment by nonparty witnesses in response to innocuous questions about Prof. Dershowitz
are said to take on a “sinister cast”; yet these same witnesses invoked their right against selfincrimination
to almost every question asked of them, including their parents’ names. Prof.
Dershowitz, as Epstein’s former legal counsel, is one of hundreds of people listed in an address
book purloined by Jeffrey Epstein’s criminal butler; yet because Prof. Dershowitz’s name is
circled in the address book by an unknown person for unknown reasons, the argument is made
that Prof. Dershowitz must have sexually abused a minor. The record shows that while Prof.
Dershowitz and **Jane Doe** #3 are both separately mentioned in the flight logs of Mr. Epstein’s
private plane, they are never listed on the same flight. Plaintiffs, in turn, falsely claim that
somehow Prof. Dershowitz single-handedly orchestrated the destruction of logs without any
evidence of ability or possibility to do so. The increasingly unfounded accusations and insults
are both sad and irresponsible.
It is precisely this toxic mix of irrelevancy,
