Subject: Reminder: AICE Update: Did the British promise the Arabs independence in **Palestine**? 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 032012 
Did the British promise the Arabs independence in 
**Palestine**? 
In July 1915, **Hussein** ibn 'Ali, the Sherif of 
Mecca, sent a letter to Sir Henry MacMahon, 
the High Commissioner for **Egypt**, informing 
him of the terms for Arab participation in the 
war against the Turks. The letters between 
**Hussein** and Mac-Mahon that followed outlined 
the areas that **Britain** was prepared to cede to 
the Arabs in exchange for their help.

**Trump**'s Saudi Arms Sale Is About Politics and 
Economics, Not Security 
by Mitchell Bard 
President **Trump** wants to use his emergency 
powers to sell billions of dollars' worth of 
weapons to **Saudi Arabia** on national security 
grounds. **Congress** wants to stop the sale 
because of lingering anger over Saudi abuses 
and the murder of journalist Jamal 
Khashoggi, and the usurpation of its legal 
authority to review arms sales. Both sides are 
ingenuous. The willingness to sell the Saudis - 
weapons has little to do with American national security, and 
everything to do with economics and politics.

**Arizona**-**Israel** Cooperation 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 032017 
The U.S.-**Israel** relationship is based on the twin pillars of shared 
values and mutual interests. Given this commonality of interests and 
beliefs, it should not be surprising that support for **Israel** is one of the 
most pronounced and consistent foreign policy values of the American 
people. 
**today**'s interdependent global economy requires that trade policy be 
developed at the national and state level. Many states have 
recognized the opportunity for realizing significant benefits by seeking 
to increase trade with **Israel**. **Arizona** is one of 33 states that have 
cooperative agreements with **Israel**.
