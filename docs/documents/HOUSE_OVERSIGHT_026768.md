I was planning on writing both of you today or tomorrow if buzzfeed decided to go ahead with their story after I 
wrote to them, but since they sent this to you here is what I was planning to forward.. namely my response to 
their email and their original email. I hope it helps. They have clearly decided in advance to try to smear me, 
and potentially other atheists (I found the remarks in their 'miscellaneous facts' telling in this regard), and I felt 
a detailed response to the false claims was important. If you want to discuss this further I am happy to. I am 
currently on a plane heading to phoenix. 
Thanks for forwarding.

I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your email. I am currently on a plane until noon pacific time, and then 
heading to a meeting right after landing, till about 2 pm or so. While I am running the risk that you will report 
my comments, if you do, either out of context, or incompletely, I am responding with an effort to be complete, 
as I always try and do with reporters. If you decide to go ahead with a story, which, after reading my responses, 
I hope you decide is inappropriate, I would like you to quote my responses fully in order not to distort them. 
It is hard to know how to respond to a list of false and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading 
statements. I treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard to support and mentor students, 
colleagues, and members of the general public, and this is supported by the institutions of which I am a part. I 
do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your reporting is to somehow argue that Universities and other 
institutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, then in fact the situation is quite the 
opposite. My high public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also opens 
me up to a host of unfounded outside complaints and allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which 
the University has to respond to. The fact that I have remained a professor in all Universities with which I have 
been associated, in good standing, and also an officer or an invited speaker at organizations like CFI, which 
have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that their experience validates a trust in my 
behavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and continue to be invited to their last 3 meetings to 
speak, specifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally appreciated my 
talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the purpose of your report is to 
impugn my integrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of your 
'miscellaneous facts', as a scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than 
allegations and innuendo by people whose motives I cannot judge. I also try and judge the facts in context. The 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026768 
fact that Universities and other organizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is 
because they value my contributions and my actions. 
The items you list are false or distorted. Item 1 refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 where 
we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and there 
were respectful and platonic encounters afterwards. There is nothing to comment on in item 3, which involves 
an anonymous 3rd party claim because I know nothing about it, there are no details provided, and it clearly was 
not taken seriously enough to result in any university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because I 
decided I didn't want to go out to a bar with a group of attendees that I was harassing them? The second part 
did not happen. Re incident 5: The 'female companion' in this case is my wife, who accompanied me on the 
cruise, and has attested to the fact that the claim is false. This is what I wrote at the time in response to the blog 
in question, causing it to be taken down. 
It is worth responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail, 
Re item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came 
to me, asked me to talk over coffee, or wrote to me with questions. When she asked about advice for after 
graduation I DID tell her she was different than the other students in her year. The rest of them were interested 
in going on to graduate school in phy
