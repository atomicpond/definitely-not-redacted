11 Places With a Worse Economy Than USA 
By Rick Newman — Fri Jul 10, 11:50 am ET 
When times are tough, one thing that tends to raise the spirits is knowing that somebody else has it worse. And as wretched as the 
U.S. economy seems, its not as bad as in other regions. 
**the International Monetary Fund**'s latest tally of world economic conditions forecasts a 2.6 decline in U.S. economic output for all of 
2009, and anemic growth of 0.8 percent in 2010. That's more optimistic than the IMF's prediction from three months ago, but those 
are still lousy numbers. A weak economy throughout 2010 would mean a bleak employment picture, an agonizingly slow housing 
recovery, and **another year** or two likely to feel like a recession, whether its technically labeled that or not. 
We should count ourselves lucky, though. The IMF expects at least 11 major parts of the world to have more severe economic 
contractions than the United State **this year**, including most of western **Europe**, **Japan**, **Russia**, and **Mexico**. **Europe** will still be 
stumbling along behind **the United States** **next year**, as well. Here are the IMF's projections for economic growth in various parts of 
the world: 
2009. 2010 
**China**. 	7.5. 	8.5 
**India**. 	5.4 	6.5 
**Middle East** 2.0 	3.7 
**Africa**. 1.8 4.7 
**Brazil**. -1.3 2.5 
World total -1.4 2.5 
**Canada**. 	-2.3 	1.6 
U.S. 	-2.6 	0.8 
**France**. 	-3.0 	0.4 
**Spain**. 	-4.0 	-0.8 
U.K. 	-4.2 	0.2 
E U. 	-4.7 	-0.1 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021231 
E **Europe**. -5.0 1.0 
Italy. 	-5.1 	-0.1 
**Japan**. 	-6.0 	1.7 
**Germany**. 	-6.2 	-0.6 
**Russia**. 	-6.5 	1.5 
**Mexico**. 	-7.3 	3.0 
If these projections come true, it means **the United States**, despite its overspent consumers, wrecked banks, and insolvent auto 
makers, will be leading the world economy out of recession. Somehow. The developing world will help, but those high growth 
projections in **China** and **India** can be deceiving. 
**China** in particular has government policies that practically mandate high growth, and 8.5 percent in 2010 would be just about the 
bare minimum to keep employment at tolerable levels. And neither **China** nor **India** is a major buyer of American-made goods and 
services; for the most part, its the other way around. With much of the developed world trailing **the United States**, it will take 
American consumers to ratchet up demand for the world's products. Scary thought. 
How to tell when a real recovery begins.? 
4 Ways to Tell When a Real Recovery Has Begun 
You could conclude just about anything from the daily cavalcade of economic statistics. Some suggest an imminent recovery. Others 
seem to foretell years of gloom. The bent of the expert interpreting the latest news—bull, bear, Obama-basher, Wall Street-hater—
has as much to do with the outlook as the numbers themselves. 
For the foreseeable future, there will be an aggressive hunt for two economic recoveries. One is the technical improvement in 
economic indicators that signals the economy is growing again. That's the one economists care about, which is why they scour the 
numbers on retail sales, business inventories, purchasing manager sentiment, subatomic inflation, the mood in **Shanghai**, and 
anything else that could help pinpoint the exact inflection point for a turnaround. 
The other recovery, the one that most consumers are waiting for, is the one in which companies stop firing and start hiring, banks 
return to normal lending, and families stop worrying about jobs and income. And that turnaround—the consumer recovery—is likely 
to take much longer to materialize than the technical recovery. 
The danger of hyping a technical recovery is that it will arrive, with much fanfare—but fail to make ordinary consumers feel better 
off. Many economists, for example, are predicting that the recession will officially end by **this summer** or fall. The only problem is 
that when a technical recovery begins, a lot of companies fail to get the memo. They don't play along; they keep payrolls lean and 
maybe even continuing to lay off workers. So to guard against false optimism, here's how to tell when a real recovery is finally 
kicking into gear: 
Unemployment improves. The single best indicator of the health of the economy is the job market. People who have lost their job, or 
worry that they might, obviously hoard their money and don't spend. That spells doom for an economy driven by consumer spending, 
as ours is. But once its clear that jobs are coming back, consumers are more likely to relax and open their wallets. 
Projections about unemployment should make anybody queasy about the prospects for a
