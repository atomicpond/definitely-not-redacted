Subject: My sister's perspective from **Europe** 
Importance: High 
am looking at this from over here in **Germany**. American politics gets reduced in the end to only a few 
issues: pro-life or pro-choice, gun laws, and establishment vs. anti-establishment. Political categories 
are so wishy washy and intermingled with what is termed 'liberal' and 'conservative' that one forgets 
what they actually mean. 
of course, not everybody who voted for **Trump** is sexist or a racist, but, on some level, they didn't care 
if he is. He knew how to gather momentum with the discourse he chose, and, even if he changes his tone, 
he has let loose a storm. We will brace ourselves over here for **Putin**'s eventual takeover of the Baltic 
States. **Putin** has extended his power back into Republic of Georgia, the **Crimea**, and Armenia. **Trump** has 
said that he would not come to the aid of **NATO** allies if they were attacked. Is is the least of our 
problems here in **Germany**; **Erdogan** is a much larger threat, for now. 
don't see **Hillary Clinton** as being at fault. I see the growth of nationalism (all throughout the world, 
not just in the **USA**) and an underestimation of the fear that non-Hispanic whites have about the 
trajectory they are on to become a minority (in the **USA** and other European countries). 
Every news show, talk show, etc here is discussing and analysing the fallout of **Trump**'s win. German 
politicians are hoping to learn from it, to stem the growth of the right wing AFD party here. As far as 
know, **Merkel** is the only leader who congratulated **Trump** with a warning.
