Title: DEEP THINKING
Subtitle: Twenty-Five Ways of Looking at AI
By: John Brockman
Length: 90,000 words
Headline: Science world luminary John Brockman assembles twenty-five of the most
important scientific minds, people who have been thinking about the field artificial
intelligence for most of their careers for an unparalleled round-table examination about
mind, thinking, intelligence and what it means to be human.
Description:
"Artificial intelligence is today's story—the story behind all other stories. It is the Second
Coming and the Apocalypse at the same time: Good AI versus evil AI." —John
Brockman
More than sixty years ago, mathematician-philosopher Norbert Wiener published a book
on the place of machines in society that ended with a warning: “we shall never receive
the right answers to our questions unless we ask the right questions…. The hour is very
late, and the choice of good and evil knocks at our door.”
In the wake of advances in unsupervised, self-improving machine learning, a small but
influential community of thinkers is considering Wiener’s words again. In Deep
Thinking, John Brockman gathers their disparate visions of where AI might be taking us.
The fruit of the long history of Brockman’s profound engagement with the most
important scientific minds who have been thinking about AI—from Alison Gopnik and
David Deutsch to Frank Wilczek and Stephen Wolfram— Deep Thinking is an ideal
introduction to the landscape of crucial issues AI presents.
The collision between opposing perspectives is salutary and exhilarating; some of these
figures, such as computer scientist Stuart Russell, Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn, and
physicist Max Tegmark, are deeply concerned with the threat of AI, including the
existential one, while others, notably robotics entrepreneur Rodney Brooks, philosopher
Daniel Dennett, and bestselling author Steven Pinker, have a very different view. Serious,
searching and authoritative, Deep Thinking lays out the intellectual landscape of one of
the most important topics of our time.
