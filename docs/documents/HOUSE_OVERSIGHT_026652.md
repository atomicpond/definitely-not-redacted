I'm dying to hear about your weekend. I can't take credit, but I heard someone say that you handling this was 
like asking your buddies if they had anyone who could fill in for a pick-up game, and somebody sends over 
LeBron.

Hi Kathy and Stuart, 
You may have already seen this article, but sharing it just in case you haven't. Please let us know if we can be 
of any help coordinating with the client's PR firm, which Stuart mentioned that you were doing **yesterday**. 
According to **Wikipedia**, "Heat Street is a libertarian conservative news, opinion and commentary website. 
Launched in ****February** 2016**, the website is headed by U.S. based British writer and former politician Louise 
Mensch. It is owned by News Corp under **Dow Jones** & Company." 
Thanks,

'Shady' Israeli Mogul Hires Ex-********White House**** Counsel**** To Represent Employee Arrested in Inauguration Day 
Riot, Raising Questions<http://heatst.com/politics/shady-israeli-mogul-hires-ex-white-house-counsel-to-

The mystery surrounding a would-be media magnate — who owns surveillance and security firms working for 
repressive regimes — is growing. 
The questions about Matania (Mati) Kochavi were sparked again **this weekend** when **Kathryn Ruemmler**, who 
until recently was **President Obama**'s ********White House**** Counsel****, showed up on **Saturday** morning in local 
****Washington** DC** court to represent one of the 217 people arrested for rioting on Inauguration Day. 
[http://heatst.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ruemmler-obamajpg?w=300]**Kathryn Ruemmler** and client. 
**Ms. Ruemmler** said she was there to represent a journalist, on assignment for the media company 
Vocativ<http://www.vocativ.com/>, who'd gotten swept up with the protesters in the arrests. 
Vocativ is owned by Kochavi. Reporters at the courthouse asked why a big gun like Ruemmler, who has long 
been a specialist in corporate crime, would show up for what would seem to be a misunderstanding involving a 
journalist doing his job. 
**Ms. Ruemmler** told **Buzzfeed** that Vocativ is a client of her 
firm,<http s ://www.buzz feed. co m/zo etillman/pro s ecutors-pursue-rioting- charges- over-inauguration- day-
pro?utm term=.gtPej4zonti.cgyzaBvG2> **Latham & Watkins**. The firm is one of the most prestigious law shops 
in **New York** and **Washington** with partners such as Ruemmler<https://www.lw.com/people/kathrynruemmler> 
charging thousands of dollars an hour. 
She did look somewhat out of place among the lawyers there to defend anarchists and other alleged 
troublemakers who are charged with rioting, burning a limo and smashing up stores on the streets of the capital. 
"The individuals charged were generally brought in front of the judge in groups of 10 and were represented by a 
cadre of public defenders and other court-appointed lawyers," according to **Buzzfeed**. That was not the case 
when it came to Vocativ. 
Based in **New York** and ****Tel Aviv****, Vocativ publishes mostly reprints of health studies, aggregated videos for 
**Facebook**, and female focused feature pieces. The company which employs a large team of US journalists and 
ex-Israeli intelligence operatives, claims to use technology from the intelligence world to source its stories.
