﻿                    Explosion

Move-in day was complete, Welcome Week had gone swimmingly, and the new academic year – 2015-16-- loomed just ahead, filled with promise.  Then came the explosion.  A closely-watched rape trial was underway at the McLennan County courthouse, a magnificent structure symbolizing the community-unifying goal of **Justice**.  **Justice** for all. **Sam** Ukwuachu, a super-talented defensive end on **Baylor**’s football team who had transferred from football powerhouse Boise State, was in the dock, charged with an egregious offense against basic human dignity.  **Sam**’s rape trial launched a crisis. Suddenly, for all the wrong reasons, **Baylor** football was thrust into the national limelight.

Explosion I

Triggering the unexpected explosion was a provocative on-line piece by the wildly popular home-grown periodical, Texas **monthly**.  Based in **Austin**, and unremittingly progressive in tone, TM published a harshly-critical on-line piece just as pre-**season** was drawing to a close.  The muck-raking on-line attack claimed that, in effect, a rape culture had grown up in the fabulously successful football program under the turbo-charged leadership of Coach Art Briles.  This was the first anyone around the Executive Council roundtable had heard anything of the sort.

A terrible pall fell over the conference room in Pat Neff 100.  Just hours before, we had all been exulting in the excitement of a new year.  Football was an integral part of what would soon unfold that autumn.  After all, in a few short years, Coach Briles had built a national powerhouse on the banks of the Brazos.  And his dream (described in Chapter 1) of an on-campus stadium had come true.  The **HOUSE** that RG III built was, in fact, the **HOUSE** that Art Briles and Drayton McLaneean, Jr. built.  Coach Briles was the inspiration, and Drayton – the dreamer of great dreams – was the driving force.   

Coach and Drayton were joined by a cracker-jack in-**HOUSE** Development team, augmented by members of the **Board** of Regents, especially former Regent Chair Dary Stone.  The staff and Regent volunteers poured themselves into the unprecedented fundraising effort.  They had triumphed.  And Year One at McLaneean had gone beautifully, marred only by injuries to two key quarterbacks.  Even then, the **2014** **season** had ended with a record-shattering offensive display in **Orlando** as the **Baylor** Bears overwhelmed the Tar Heels of **North Carolina** with a high-speed “Wildcat” offense (no quarterback).  

For his part, Coach Briles had quickly built an eye-popping football program that matched the stunningly impressive stadium, which in short order became a gathering place for the broader community, not just the **Baylor** family.  Indeed, at Coach Briles’ urging, the very first game played at McLaneean Stadium was not a **Baylor** Bears high-octane display of razzle-dazzle offense, but a high-school match-up straight out of **Friday** night lights.  **Baylor** was making a statement – McLaneean Stadium is for all of us, not just for **Baylor** Nation on college game day.

As I mentioned in a previous chapter, “Field of Dreams” brought into popular culture an abiding idea – if you build it, they will come.   Unlike a Midwestern corn field turned into a ghostly baseball diamond summoning forth spirits from bygone days, McLaneean Stadium – which at Coach Briles’ insistence was renamed (prior to opening) to carry the McLean family name rather than the institutionalized, plain-vanilla “**Baylor** Stadium” – brought tens of thousands of fans and friends to the banks of the Brazos.  **season** ticket sales skyrocketed.  Games were now sold out.  At the aging Floyd Casey Stadium, albeit home to great memories over **a half century**, we worked hard to fill the seats.  The occasional sell-out would occur when, say, the Longhorns came to Waco and eagerly bought up the thousands of unwanted tickets.  That was then.  Now, ESPN regularly brought “Game Day” to campus, and the prevailing colors were the beautiful gold of the **Baylor** Line, with shades of **Baylor** green sprinkled in.  The optics were even better than at green-and-gold dominated Lambeau Field in Green Bay.  

And so **Sam** Ukwuachu came.  He had traveled way north from **Houston**, where he had done well enough academically in high school but whose strength and speed attracted the attention of gridiron programs across the country.  He chose national powerhouse Boise State, but he was soon unhappy and homesick.  His head football coach looked after him, thought he should be closer to home, called Coach Briles, and soon **Sam** was a **Baylor** Bear, although he never played football at **Baylor**.  When **Sam** was charged with the unspeakably horrible act of rape, he protested his innocence and defended himself vigorously.  Devastating testimony by a former girlfriend from Boise State – who contradicted **Sam**’s testimony of non-violence – likely sealed his fate.  The McLennan County jury found him guilty, but then fashioned an oddly lenient sentence – probation.  As I write, **Sam** continue
