**Dear Mr**. Epstein: 
Please allow me to introduce myself My name is Marlene Edme; I am the founder and President. .For above-
mentioned organization and Yair Fatal is the Project Director. The organization was founded in **2007** with the 
mission of providing free technical skills in the garment industry to the people in the Southeastern department 
of **Haiti**. Following the earthquake, the living and economic conditions are deplorable. More than ever, 
CEFOTAJ wants to double its effort to help the community of Jacmel out of desperation by providing the youth 
with valuable sustainable skills. With a trade under their belt, the youth will be more confident while seeking 
employment. 
We have obtained our 501 - C (3) in **2008** and have recently received the approval of the **Haiti**'s Department of 
Planning to be a non-governmental organization (NGO). The organization's building that will **HOUSE** the 
school is currently under construction. 
Based on our research, we found that you are very committed to helping **Haiti**. The purpose of this 
correspondence is to solicit The Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation assistance with grant coordination and 
facilitation to help our organization get off the ground. With potential help from the international community, 
we believe that the project would be rewarding for the citizens of the city of Jacmel and in line with the 
requirements of the **Haiti** Reconstruction Plan and **President Obama** recent legislation of the "Hope" law.. 
Please find enclosed a copy of the project which provides detailed information about the curriculum for the 
different programs that the school will offer. We trust that you will find this to be an interesting project with
