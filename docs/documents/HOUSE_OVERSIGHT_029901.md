Subject: **Edge** Question **2011** - An Invitation 
Importance: High 
"Deliciously creative.., the variety astonishes...intellectual skyrockets of stunning brilliance. Nobody 
in the world is doing what **Edge** is doing." Denis Dutton, ARTS & LETTERS DAILY 
THE WORLD QUESTION CENTER 
James Flynn has defined "shorthand abstractions" (or "sHA's") as concepts drawn from science that have 
become part of the language and make people smarter by providing widely applicable templates ("market", 
"placebo", "random sample," "naturalistic fallacy," are a few of his examples). His idea is that the 
abstraction is available as a single cognitive chunk which can be used as an element in thinking and 
debate. 
The **Edge** Question **2011** 
WHAT SCIENTIFIC CONCEPT WOULD IMPROVE EVERYBODY'S COGNITIVE TOOLKIT? 
The term 'scientific"is to be understood in a broad sense as the most reliable way of gaining knowledge 
about anything, whether it be the human spirit, the role of great people in history, or the structure of 
DNA. A "scientific concept" may come from philosophy, logic, economics, jurisprudence, or other analytic 
enterprises, as long as it is a rigorous conceptual tool that may be summed up succinctly (or "in a 
phrase") but has broad application to understanding the world. 
[Thanks to Steven Pinker for suggesting this **year**'s **Edge** Question and to **Daniel Kahneman** for advice on 
its presentation.]

EDITORIAL MARCHING ORDERS 
Say something new, true, and interesting, based on your own experience, in 1,000 words or less. Email 
contributions to me. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 029901 
As usual, no politics ("Democrat" "Republican") or politicians ("Obama" "**Bush**" "**CLINTON**" "Pali n', etc.), 
editorials, opeds, opinion pieces, flippancy. No ad hominem comments. No self-promotion: referencing your 
books, papers, courses, "selling from the stage", pushing your well-known agenda. No footnotes or 
hyperlink: stay on the page. No anecdotes about spouses, significant others, kids, family pets. Write a 
stand-alone piece: don't respond to the pieces of other contributors already posted. 
Go deeper than the news. Tell me something I don't know. This is not a purely scientific question: this 
is question about our culture and ourselves. The ideas we present on **Edge** can offer readers and the wider 
public a new set of metaphors to describe ourselves, our minds, the way we think, the world, and all of 
the things we know in it. 
Be imaginative, exciting, compelling, inspiring. Tell a great story. Make an argument that makes a 
difference. Amaze and delight. Surprise us! 
I look forward to hearing from you. **Happy **New **year******! 
Sincerely, 
**John Brockman**
