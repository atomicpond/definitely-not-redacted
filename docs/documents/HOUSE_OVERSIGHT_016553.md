Anne,
I have approved **SPR** 14-2007 and 5-2008. The Larkin item is OK. The appeal by Brindell re 144 Wells
Road should not be on the agenda. The sod/seed item is an item that Tim Frank is working on but I don't
think it's an agenda item. We need to check with Peter on that one. The infrastructure of large homes is
not an agenda item. Neither is the **Trump** appeal for 515 **North County Road**.
Two things that will be added though are: EAR Amendments and Zoning Study Items.
