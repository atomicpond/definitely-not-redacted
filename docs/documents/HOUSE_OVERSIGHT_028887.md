﻿05/12/2014 the Cathedral – to **Shlomo Gazit**
     •	As the year 2015 begins, we find ourselves at the height of a historic earthquake, in multiple dimensions, the like of which hasn’t been seen since the end of WWI and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.

     •	In **the **Middle East**** – within **three years**, the "**Arab Spring**" turned into the "Islamic winter" – borders have vanished and centuries of conflicts between tribes and factions are erupting onto the surface.

     •	The bi-polar and multi-polar world we knew has been replaced by a world with not even one geopolitical center of gravity. It is a  Gestalt in which everything depends on everything else, and dealing with the challenges requires global cooperation
.
     •	Israel finds itself  at the center of a kind of "perfect storm,"the only outpost of the western way of life in **the **Middle East**** – at the meeting point of the "clash of civilizations" between Islam and the West, as Huntington envisioned it, and at the same time, in the spinning "eye of the storm" of the clash of titans within Islam itself: between Sunni and Shi'ite, between tradition, extremism and terrorism on the one hand, and modernity and moderation on the other; between the dream of "past glory" and the vision of a "leap into the future”. And all of this is drenched in a lot of blood.

     •	This drama that has washed over the Arab world bears two lessons and one insight for us:
  The 1st lesson:  "Be modest in prophecy". In particular, when it comes to the future. Mubarak for example had about 400,000 people at his disposal working in various security agencies in order to preemptively predict events such as those that took place at ****Tahrir Square****. And he did not foresee the uprising. So who can?

  The 2nd lesson: When friends, and even the leaders among us, say: "Don't get swept into a panic – if something really grave happens (Iran for example) – the US will not stand by. The world will take action!"

  And I say: Don't bet on it. Look at Syria. Assad has massacred 200,000 of his own people – with tanks, artillery, fighter jets, even chemical weapons – and the world did not lift a finger.

  And the one insight: To all our opponents and even friends who tell us that our lack of success in reaching an agreement with the Palestinians is the root of all the troubles in **the **Middle East**** – the original sin! – I say: this is not true!
  Even if I, in 2000 (or Rabin and Peres in 1994 or Olmert in 2008), were to have reached a peace treaty with the Palestinians – which would have been implemented a long time ago the "Muslim Brotherhood" would still have taken control over Egypt and Al-Sisi would still have taken it back a short time after.

     •	Syria would still have been embroiled in a bitter civil war. **And Iran** – would still be striving for regional hegemony and nuclear military capability.
     •	The reasons for all the above are deeply rooted in the history of the nations and the region – and do not stem from the Israeli Palestinian conflict (they may be related to it in another way, which I will get to later on).

     •	In the new reality forged by the "**Arab Spring**," there is good news and bad news for us.
Let's start with the bad news:
  ISIS, the disintegration of Syria, the events in Iraq – all of these are bad news that prove to us, time and time again, that **the **Middle East**** is indeed a tough neighborhood. There is no mercy for the weak, and there will be no second opportunity for those who don't defend themselves. **every year**, new threats arise. And the old ones: **Hezbollah**, Iran, terrorism –are all "alive and kicking" and growing even stronger.

  But there is good news too. Israel is the strongest country in the region, from Tripoli in Libya to Tehran. It's the strongest militarily, strategically, and economically, and if we know act wisely–diplomatically too. Equally important: Israel will continue to be the strongest country in the region in the foreseeable future – especially if we manage to identify and cultivate these sources of empowerment and advantage – including:

     •	 **Armed Forces** capable of defeating any outside combination of threats, including terrorism.
     •	A strong and growing economy in an open relationship with global markets.
     •	Foreign policy that assures international backing, especially American – diplomatic and economic- backing  Israel's positions, and which holds the "moral high ground" vis-a-vis our enemies and opponents.

     •	The fact that Israel is stronger than any combination of enemies is what enables us to act from a position of strength and self confidence in order to change the reality : to counter the threats and to seize the opportunities.

     •	Let me elaborate briefly about each of the threats:
Two ironies and one insight about Isis.
  Assad slaughtered 200,000 of his people including by using chemical weapons – and that wasn't enough to get the British parliament and Prime Minister Cameron or the American **Congress** and President Oba
