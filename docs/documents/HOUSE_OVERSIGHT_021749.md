Jeffrey Epstein prosecutor was 
previously rebuked for handling of a 
child sex case 
Julie K. Brown 
**nine months** before cutting a covert plea deal with sex trafficking suspect Jeffrey 
Epstei , Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta was notified that the lead 
prosecutor in Epstein's case had concealed victim information in another underage 
sex crimes case, **the ****Miami Herald****** has learned. 
The prosecutor, A. **Marie Villafaria**, was harshly rebuked by a federal judge in 
**January 2007** for what he called her "intentional and/or serious lapse in judgment" 
when she failed to explicitly inform him that the defendant, a Texas man who 
traveled to Florida to have sex with a **14-year-old** girl, had a prior history of

the stinging language in his order. 
Senior U.S. **District Court** Judge William J. Zloch copied Acosta on his order,

for **the Southern District** of Florida, as well as the Assistant **United States** Attorney 
assigned to the above-styled cause, found it appropriate to intentionally withhold ... 
information from the court."

A. **Marie Villafaria** was the lead federal prosecutor in the Jeffrey Epstein sex case. The U.S. attorney's office's handling of 
the prosecution, which led to a plea to minor charges in state court, has been harshly criticized. 
**Later that year**, Acosta and Villafaria put together a plea bargain for Epstein, a 
multimillionaire money manager who sexually abused nearly three dozen teenage 
girls at his mansion in **Palm Beach**. The deal, a federal judge ruled **last month**, was 
intentionally kept from his victims in violation of **the **Crime Victims**' **Rights Act****. 
While the two cases are
