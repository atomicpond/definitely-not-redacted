Summary
To save you the agony of plodding through this fascinating, information-rich paper, I’ll get straight to the point: Donald Trump
will be the next President of the United States after having won an easy victory over Hillary Clinton in **November 2016**. The
reasons:
I.)
II.)
III.)
Section one shows that the essential characteristics of the narrative for the Trump campaign and the Reagan campaign
of 1980 are surprisingly similar, which would point to a Trump landslide.
Section two describes the poor state of the current economy using detrended GDP per adult, the ratio of employmentto-adult-population
and new home sales per 1,000 adults and how these measures strongly indicate a Republican
victory.
Using historical data for the Gallup poll question “are you satisfied” and presidential election dates, this section would
point to an overwhelming Republican win in **November 2016**.
IV.) Relying on voter turnout data this year versus **earlier years** and party selection, the Republicans have a large advantage
coming into the Fall election.
V.)
Basing our forecast on the past eight years of Congressional elections—House and Senate—as well as state elections
of house, senate and governors, the Republicans should be exceedingly confident about the upcoming presidential
election.
VI.) Taking careful measure of what both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have done in the public eye, Trump has the
issues on his side.
I. 1979-1980 How the Reagan Revolution Began
In early 1979, a group of Ronald Reagan acolytes—some 10 to 15 in total—got together in Justin Dart’s office at Rexall (the
corner of La Cienega and Beverly) and there they formed the original Reagan Executive Advisory Committee. With very few
exceptions (initially only me), this group had been called Reagan’s Kitchen Cabinet. Those present and those also invited
included Justin Dart, Holmes Tuttle, Jack Wrather, Bill French Smith, Bill Wilson, Earle Jorgensen, Ben Biaggini, Ted
Cummings, Alfred Bloomingdale, Charles Wick, Henry Salvatori et moi. I was the youngest of the group by **three decades**.
And, in fact, the only way Justin Dart could convince the others to let me be a member was that they needed someone to keep
the minutes of the meetings, i.e. as a secretary. In speaking with a reporter about the Kitchen Cabinet, here’s what Jus Dart
had to say: “In addressing the question of how many of Reagan's friends actually qualify as members, Dart said: ‘Damn fewer
than is generally advertised.’” 1 That just says it all.
The purpose of this committee was to provide guidance and support to the emerging presidential candidacy of one Ronald
Reagan. The members were to a person close, close, close friends and supporters of Ronald Reagan or husbands of Nancy
Reagan’s best friends. And the race for **the **White House**** began.
During this pre-primary and primary process, Ronald Reagan was disrespected and abused by a significant segment of the
Republican establishment. 2 He was called an empty suit, a trigger-happy **California** cowboy, only an actor, a person who
spoke words others wrote, a racist, a bigot, a divorcée, a war monger and the man who would start the Third World War. My
favorite slur came from none other than **the **Democratic Party****’s “éminence grise” Clark Clifford, 3 who referred to Ronald
Reagan as an “amiable dunce.” The torrent of anti-Reagan epithets never stopped.

There is a display at the Young Americans Foundation in Santa Barbara of a number of these anti-Reagan videos by any number of Republican and
Democratic stalwarts.

As if receiving divine retribution for his nasty ways, Clark Clifford, who served as Secretary of Defense for President Johnson and as an advisor to
Presidents Truman, Kennedy and Carter, was indicted in **the early 1990s** on charges of conspiracy, fraud and bribery surrounding the Bank of Credit
and Commerce International scandal.

In fact, the whole group of us received virtually no support from **the Republican Party** or the Party’s elders. It wasn’t until
Reagan had finally defeated George Bush, along with John Connally, Howard Baker, Phil Crane, Bob Dole and John Anderson
in the primary race, that there was any attempt to be conciliatory to Ronald Reagan’s presidential campaign by the Republican
powers that were. Even Barry Goldwater,
