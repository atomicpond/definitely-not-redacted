VIRGINIA ROBERTS
Edwards adv. Epstein

DATE: April 07, 2011
JS:
BE:
Virginia, **Jack Scarola** and **Brad Edwards**
Hi Virginia.
V: Hi Jack! Hi Brad! How you guys doing?
JS: We’re doing fine, thank you. I’m sorry for all of the trouble and before we go any
further, let me tell you, if I have your permission, I have started a tape recorder and I
want to be able to tape this conversation from the very beginning. Is that alright with
you?
V: Sure, that’s fine, Jack. No problem
JS: Ok, good, thank you. I appreciate that. Let me start off by introducing myself. I know
that Brad has spoken to you about me but I am Brad’s lawyer, and I assume that you can
confirm that you and I have never had any communication before. Is that right?
V: That’s correct.
JS: Alright. I have, however, gotten some information from Brad about conversations that
you have had with him, and that will enable me, hopefully, to make this a little bit more
efficient and take up a minimum amount of your time while still getting the information
that we think is going to be helpful to us and to any jury that might ultimately have to
hear these facts.
So, let me begin by asking you first to tell us what your full name is.
V: Virginia Louise Roberts. That’s my maiden name. My married name is Virginia Louise

JS:
Could you spell your last name for us? That is your married last name:
V:
JS:
Airight, thank you, and where are you living right now?
V: I live in Australia.
JS:
And how long have you resided in Australia.
V: Thisismyl9 th year.
JS:
That is where you are right now, correct? We’ve reached you in Australia for this phone
conversation?
V: That is correct, yes.
JS:
And what time is it in Australia right now?
V: I think it’s about 9:00 now.
JS: Ok. That’s 9am, correct?
V: That’s correct.
JS: Airight. Virginia, the reason for this conversation is because it is our understanding that
you know a man by the name Jeffrey Epstein, and I want to begin by asking you please to
tell us about the circumstances of your first meeting Mr. Epstein.
V: Ok. I was introduced to Mr. Epstein by **Ghislaine** Maxwell. I was working at Donald
Trump’s spa in Mar-a-Lago and I was prompted by **Ghislaine** to come to Jeffrey’s
mansion in **Palm Beach** that afternoon after work to make some extra money and to learn
about massage. She met me at the spa, and I was reading a book about anatomy, so I was
already interested in massage therapy as it was and not having any of the education or
you know anything behind me, I thought this was a great opportunity to work for her and
go. So, I went to Jeffrey’s mansion about 5 or 6 in the afternoon
