**Dear Friends**, 
I wanted to share with you the forward to my father's new book '**After Words**'. He truly is 
an inspiration and so is his writing. The book, which is a compilation of his speeches, was 
launched yesterday in Sydney. I will be sure to send you a copy, it's a brilliant read. 
I trust this email finds you well. 
Kindest regards

Creativity is central to our endeavours

**Paul Keating** is aware that many people see him as a puzzle and contradiction. During the 
interview he explained he wrote this introduction to his book as a guide to help people see the 
unifying philosophy of his life, public and private. 
FRIEDRICH Schiller, the German philosopher, said: "If man is ever to solve the problems of politics in practice he 
will have to approach it through the problem of the aesthetic, because it is only through beauty that man makes his 
way to freedom." 
Romantic and idealistic as that view may seem to some, the thought is revelatory of the fact that the greater part of 
human aspiration has been informed by individual intuition and privately generated passions, more than it has 
through logic or scientific revelation. The moral basis of our public life, our social organisation, has come from 
within us - by aspiration and by light, not by some process of logical deduction. 
**Immanuel Kant** referred to our inner impulses as "the higher self", an unconscious search for truth, going deeply 
into ourselves to establish who we are and what we should be. 
Beauty is about the quest for perfection or an ideal, and that quest has to begin with aesthetic imagination - 
something informed by conscience, carved by duty. Kant called it "the inner command", the ethical construct one 
creates to guide one from within.

But we need tools to mine good intentions: inspirations, ones which await the creative spark, the source of all 
enlargement. Creativity is central to our progress and to all human endeavour. 
Music provides the clue: unlike other forms of art, music is not representational. Unlike the outcome of the 
sciences, it was never discoverable or awaiting discovery. A Mahler symphony did not exist before Mahler created 
it. 
E.T.A. Hoffman, a contemporary of Beethoven's, famously said: "Music reveals to man an unknown realm, a world 
quite separate from the outer sensual world surrounding him, a world in which he leaves behind all feelings 
circumscribed by intellect in order to embrace the inexpressible." 
This is not to turn our back on reason. Or to argue that modernism, with all its secular progress through education, 
industrialisation, communications, transport and the centralised state, has not spectacularly endowed the world as 
no other movement before it. But a void exists between the drum-roll of mechanisation with its cumulative power of 
science and the haphazard, explosive power of creativity and passion. Science is forever trying to undress nature 
while the artistic impulse is to be wrapped in it. 
While these approaches are different - perhaps often diametrically opposite - they inform related strands of thinking 
in ways that promote energy and vision. 
This is what I have found when these forces are contemplated in tandem. When passion and reason vie with each 
other, the emerging inspiration is invariably deeper and of an altogether higher form. One is able to knit between 
them, bringing into existence an overarching unity - a coherence - which fidelity to the individual strands cannot 
provide. 
In the world I have lived in, the world of politics, political economy and internationalism, the literature exists in 
abundance. But what is far from abundant are the frameworks for the intuitive resolution of complex problems that 
require multi-dimensional solutions. 
But from where do we glean this extra dimensionality? 
For me, it has always been from two sources: policy ambition in its own right and from imagination - the dreaming. 
Policy ambition arising from Kant's higher self, and imagination promoted by those reliable wellsprings - music, 
poetry, art and architecture - blending the whole into a creative flux. 
This collection of speeches reflects many of those interests and impulses - whether it be Joern Utzon's Opera 
House or the imperative of liberal internationalism in foreign policy or Neoclassicism, the future of native title or the 
rise of China. Each is related in a wider construct which is part and parcel of the way I have viewed and thought 
about the world. 
While the speeches are from the period after my prime ministerial life and period in government, the impulse in 
writing them came from the same framework and inclinations which inform
