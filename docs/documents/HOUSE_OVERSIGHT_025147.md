BALANCE OF POWER 
The Race Between State and Society 
By Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson 
[US — Penguin Press, UK — Viking, Germany — Fischer Verlag, Netherlands — Nieuw Amsterdam, Italy — 
Il Saggiatore, Spain — Duesto, Brazil — Intrinseca, Greece — Livanis, Korea — Sigongsa, Taiwan — 
Acropolis, Vietnam — Tre Publishing, Audio — Penguin RH; Proposal and sample chapter; 500 pages; 
Delivery: December 2018] 
Balance of Power is the important, groundbreaking new book by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson, authors 
of Why Nations Fail, a widely acclaimed international bestseller that has sold close to half a million copies in 
English, and hundreds of thousands in translations around the world. 
"Balance of Power," Acemoglu and Robinson write, "develops an entirely original thesis about the diversity of 
the ways in which states function, resolve conflicts, provide public services and more broadly use their powers. 
It is the logical extension of a research agenda we have been developing together for **twenty years**, and we have 
a great deal to offer on this topic. We have demonstrated our ability not only to produce original, thought-
provoking social science works but also to reach and explain our ideas to a broad audience." 
DARON ACEMOGLU is the Elizabeth and James Killian Professor of Economics in the Department of 
Economics at **the **Massachusetts** Institute of Technology**. He was the recipient of the John Bates Clark Medal in 
2005, awarded **every two years** to the best economist in the United States under the age of forty by the American 
Economic Association, and the Erwin Plein Nemmers prize, awarded **every two years** for work of lasting 
significance in economics. He holds Honorary Doctorates from the University of Utrecht, Bosporus University, 
and the University of Athens. 
JAMES A. ROBINSON is an economist and political scientist who is currently one of eight University 
Professors at **the University of Chicago** and one of only twenty-one people who have held such a position. He 
has conducted research in Bolivia, Botswana, Chile, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, 
Mauritius, Mexico, the Philippines, Sierra Leone, and **South Africa**. He was selected as one of **Foreign Policy**'s 
"Top Global Thinkers of 2012" and is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

THE JANUS POINT 
A New Theory of Time's Arrows and The Big Bang 
By Julian Barbour 
[US — Basic Books, UK — Bodley Head; Proposal; 80,000 — 100,000 words; Delivery: **November 2017**] 
"The Janus Point," writes Julian Barbour, visiting professor at the University of Oxford and author of The End 
of Time, "proposes a novel and remarkably simple solution to one of the most fundamental problems in physics 
and cosmology. It concerns the experienced direction of time: Why is the past so different from the present and 
the future? This difference is encapsulated in the expression the arrow of time. It is problematic because all the 
known laws of nature have exactly the same form, whatever direction, in which time is supposed to flow. The

technical expression for this is time-reversal symmetry. This basic property seems to be entirely at odds with the 
pronounced unidirectionality of experienced time. In fact, there are several arrows. 
"Until recent work by myself and my collaborators Tim Koslowski and Flavio Mercati, essentially only one 
proposal had been made—in well over a century—to explain why, despite the time-reversal symmetry of all the 
laws of nature, these pronounced arrows of time exist, and always have existed, throughout the observable 
universe. As I explain in The Janus Point, this sole explanation is a manifest stop gap and satisfies no serious 
scientist. 
"This has been dubbed the past hypothesis. However, it is not in any sense an explanation that follows from the 
structure of the law and does not lead to any new prediction. It is an admission of defeat: Modern science fails to 
explain the most profound aspects of our existence. 
"The Janus Point is clearly timely because it is about a set of very simple ideas and insights that have the 
potential to solve one of the deepest and longest-standing problems in physics. Everyone is interested in time 
and its numerous puzzling aspects. Proof of that is the success of my earlier book The End of Time, which is still 
selling more than sixteen years after its publication. Some of the ideas conjectured in that book are, in fact, 
realized in the model now proposed. 
"For readers, The Janus Point tells the fascinating story of one of the greatest mysteries in science and what 
looks to be its unexpected and, in principle, remarkably simple solution. More than most books in popular 
science, its subject resonates profoundly with the reader.
