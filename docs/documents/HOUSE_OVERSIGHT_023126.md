Top aide of Jeffrey Epstein 
prosecutor Acosta: We acted with 
integrity 
February 15, **2019** 12:17 PM 
**Palm Beach** multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein is a free man, despite sexually abusing 
dozens of underage girls according to police and prosecutors. His victims have never 
had a voice, until now. By **Emily Michot** I Julie K. Brown  
A former top prosecutor involved in the Jeffrey Epstein sex case is defending his old 
boss, Alexander Acosta, whose decision to craft a secret plea deal with the wealthy 
New York hedge fund manager has come under federal scrutiny. 
In his first public comments on the **10-year-old** case, Jeffrey H. **Sloman** — who at 
the time was second in command under Acosta at the U.S. Attorney's Office in 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023126 
**Miami** — said prosecutors resolved the case based on the facts and evidence, and 
what he called "legal impediments," including the belief that many of Epstein's 
teenage victims were too "terrified" to cooperate in the case. 
"Given the obstacles we faced in fashioning a robust federal prosecution, we decided 
to negotiate a resolution," said **Sloman**, now in private practice. "We did not reach 
this decision lightly and it came only after significant and often rancorous internal 
debate." 
**Jeffrey **Sloman****, who was second-in-command to then-U.S. Attorney Alexander 
Acosta when the latter was deciding whether to prosecute Jeffrey Epstein, says the 
office handled the case properly. Aixa Montero Holt 
In a lengthy opinion piece  submitted to the ******Miami** **Herald****** Editorial Board, **Sloman** 
alleges that the attacks on Acosta's role in the controversial case are politically 
driven by critics who failed to raise significant issues when Acosta was nominated 
and confirmed as the U.S. secretary of **Labor** in **2017**. 
**Sloman**'s comments come **two weeks** after **the Justice Department** announced it had 
opened an investigation over whether there was prosecutorial misconduct in the 
case involving Epstein, who ran a sex pyramid scheme from his **Palm Beach** estate 
that targeted scores of underage girls from 2001 to 2006. 
About 30 members of **Congress** demanded the probe following a ******Miami** **Herald****** 
series of stories, "Perversion of Justice," that detailed how federal prosecutors, led 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023127 
by Acosta, stitched together an unusual immunity deal that allowed Epstein to 
escape what could have been a life sentence in federal prison. 
U.S. **Labor** Secretary Alexander Acosta has been criticized for the plea deal he 
worked out with Jeffrey Epstein. Acosta was U.S. attorney for Southern Florida at 
the time. Alan Diaz 
Instead, Epstein — whose friends included President Donald Trump, former 
President Bill Clinton and other politically connected people — was allowed to 
quietly plead guilty to prostitution charges in state court. He served **13 months** in 
the county jail, where he was allowed liberal work release privileges rarely given to 
sex offenders in Florida and barred by the **Palm Beach** Sheriffs Department's own 
rules. 
He was released in **2009**, but his victims — who were 13 to 16 years old at the time — 
are still fighting more than **a decade later** to have his non-prosecution agreement 
overturned. 
In his op-ed, **Sloman** called Acosta "an outstanding public servant ... at risk of 
becoming collateral damage in **Washington**'s latest polarized conflagration," adding, 
"I won't let it happen without first being heard." 
Jeffrey Epstein apologizes, but not to his victims 
Jeffrey Epstein, a multimillionaire who molested dozens of underage girls, and is 
suspected of trafficking countless other girls around the world, issued a public 
apology **Tuesday**. It was not to the victims of his abuse, but to one of their lawyers. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023128 
"As additional details about Epstein's crimes have emerged, it is clear to me that we 
should have pushed for much harsher terms," **Sloman** wrote. "That said, some have 
mistakenly suggested that our office kowtowed to Epstein's high-priced defense 
lawyers or, worse, that his lawyers corrupted or intimidated us into submission. ... 
Nothing could be further from the truth." 
**Sloman** did not directly address the chief complaint brought by Epstein's victims, 
who are now in **their late 20s and early 30s**. Those who spoke to the **Herald** said 
they felt betrayed by federal prosecutors, who sealed the non-prosecution agreement 
from public view so that they wouldn't find out about it before he was sentenced. It 
would be **almost a year** before they were successful in having it unsealed. By then, it 
was too late to try to derail it. 
They allege, in a federal lawsuit filed ag
