Lost paradise at the **Palm House**
The planned $91M hotel-condo project has been a case study in EB-5 fraud, leaving investors in the lurch and an unfinished
building in its wake
By Keith Larsen | June 17, 2019 11:00AM
The **Palm House**
When Chinese, Iranian and Turkish investors received marketing brochures for the
town of **Palm Beach**’s first EB-5 project in 2012, it seemed like a sure thing.
Pamphlets in Chinese and Farsi showed photos of the **Clintons** and Donald Trump as
part of the **Palm House** condominium and hotel advisory board of “political and
business leaders with worldwide experience.” In addition, the marketing materials
named Celine Dion, Tony Bennett and billionaire Bill Koch as celebrity members at
the hotel’s club.
But more than **Six years later**, the **Palm House**’s planned $91 million makeover
remains unfinished. The dilapidated 80,000-plus-square-foot hotel finally sold in a
bankruptcy auction **last month** to a U.S. affiliate of the real estate investment firm
London & Regional Properties for just shy of $40 million.
To add salt to the wound, Trump and **CLINTON** were never on the project’s advisory

in EB-5 funding for personal expenses, including the purchase of a 151-foot yacht
named “Alibi” and his own debt payments.
**Matthews** and the project’s general contractor, Nicholas Laudano, recently pleaded
guilty to fraud charges in federal court, while the 91 EB-5 backers lost their $500,000
investments and never received their green cards.
The EB-5 regional center in charge of marketing the **Palm House** project and
soliciting the investments, however, has not been criminally charged. The South
Atlantic Regional Center (SARC) and its director, Joseph Walsh Sr., were allegedly
able to siphon nearly $9.5 million of the foreign investors’ money, according to a civil
complaint filed by the SEC in federal court.
To date, Walsh has only been charged civilly. He was allegedly even found recently
trying to solicit other EB-5 investors for another hotel project in **Miami Beach**, per a
lawsuit filed in ******Palm Beach** County****.
“This is the most egregious fraud case I have ever seen,” said attorney David **George**,
of **George** Gesten McDonald PLLC, who’s representing EB-5 investors in the Palm
House lawsuit.
Regional centers like SARC function as middlemen between
developers and their foreign investors. But despite the key role
they play in the EB-5 process, there’s minimal regulation over
how they operate and few safeguards to protect investors.
The current system, critics say, is a petri dish for fraud that
allows bad actors to come and go — in many cases with no
criminal prosecutions. At the same time, lobbyists for the real
estate industry have pushed to ensure these rules remain in place.
“No one is watching the regional centers,” said Doug Litowitz, a **Chicago** attorney who
was not involved in the **Palm House** lawsuit but represents Chinese clients in other

**Matthews**, 61, gave investors the impression that he was a well-known luxury hotel
developer with a global track record, including completed projects in **New York**, Bora
Bora and **Mexico**. There is no evidence of him completing these projects.
Instead, his past dealings were mired in controversy and litigation, including another
failed condo-hotel project in **Nantucket** called the Point Breeze that was forced into
bankruptcy in 2010.
**Matthews**, who was raised in **Massachusetts**, moved to **Connecticut** in the mid-80s
after dropping out of college and started buying up apartments and commercial
properties in Waterbury. Locals there began drawing comparisons between **Matthews**
and the fictional Jay Gatsby due to his ritzy parties and expensive tastes, according to
the Hartford Courant.
He owned a 108-foot yacht named the Bon Vivant and claimed to possess **North
Carolina**’s original Bill of Rights, which had been stolen by a Union soldier in 1865
and was recovered by the FBI just over 10 years ago. Adding to the Gatsby
comparisons, **Matthews** became close with **Connecticut**’s then-governor, John
Rowland, in **the 90s**.
The developer used his political connections to secure favorable contracts with the
state government, allowing him to purchase government-owned property, among
other things, according to **the **New York** Times**. To return the favor, **Matthews**
allegedly bought a condo in Was
