﻿Kiev, 12 June 2017
Dear George,
Re: Ukrainian Banking Opportunity
Further to our discussion, I am sending a brief presentation on the prospect of
establishing a banking footprint in **Ukraine** through the acquisition of a bank.
Currently the central bank in **Ukraine**, the National Bank of **Ukraine** (NBU) is not
keen to issue new banking licenses but urge prospective investors to acquire an
existing license.
The main drivers for my positive stance on investing in the banking sector in
**Ukraine** are:
▪ the improving economy following the **IMF** program with demanding but
required structural reforms, with real GDP growth expected to reach 4% in
**2020**;
▪ the improving political conditions in terms of the conflict with Russia with
the support of **NATO**;
▪ the recent developments in the EU-**Ukraine** relationship with the abolition of
visa and the prospect of concluding the Association Agreement in **July**;
▪ the investment and commitments from supranational institutions so far
(EBRD: c. US$6 billion being the third largest exposure of the bank after
**Turkey** and Russia, **World Bank**: c. US$5 billion);
▪ the significant restructuring efforts in ensuring a healthier banking sector
following AQR that resulted to the nationalization of the biggest bank
Privatbank and the closing of half of the banks (over 90 banks), and the
preparation of the state sector banks (52% share of assets) for privatization
in the next 2 to **3 years**; and
▪ the current landscape of the banking sector that allows organic expansion
because of very few notable foreign banks that have the ability to develop
business or, even more, to exploit the potential for consolidating the banking
sector where government owns 52% in a market with increasing trend in
loans and deposits and high commission income.

Economy
Following a severe crisis in 2014-15, the economy is growing again-by 2.3 percent
in 2016-and the flexible exchange rate and tight fiscal and monetary policies have
greatly reduced internal and external imbalances. GDP, which declined from its
peak of US$183 billion in **2013** to US$90 billion in **2015**, is now recovering at a
growth above 2% and is expected to grow at 3.2% in **2018**. Growth is projected at
3.5%-4% in the medium term (**IMF**).
The current account deficit fell sharply, from over 9% of GDP in **2013** to 3.6% of
GDP in 2016 and reserves-while still low-have more than doubled to US$17.6
billion (end of 2017 target at US$21.3 billion). The overall fiscal deficit-including
the energy sector’s quasi-fiscal losses, which had increased to 10 percent of GDP
in 2014, declined to 2.3% of GDP in 2016, supported by strong spending control
and the decision to raise energy tariffs to market levels.
Inflation has fallen steadily from its peak of 61% in **April **2015**** to 12.4% by end-
2016, well within the target range of the NBU. It is projected to reach 9% in 2017
and 5% in the medium term.
**Ukraine** has entered into a **4-year** Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with **IMF** in
**March **2015**** for US$17.5 billion. Following the third review by **IMF** the fourth
tranche of US$1 billion was approved which would bring total disbursements
under the arrangement to about US$8.38 billion. The EFF aims to put the economy
on the path to recovery, restore external sustainability, strengthen public finances,
maintain financial stability, and support economic growth by advancing structural
and governance reforms, while protecting the most vulnerable.
The Ukrainian **Administration** showed commitment to reforms by nationalising the
largest private bank, Privatbank, and liquidating over 100 banks within **3 years**.

Also, collection of taxes has increased significantly (34% increase in **2 years**) and
spending has been contained while at the same time energy/utility tariffs have
increased dramatically at full cost recovery basis.
The main reforms agreed with the **IMF** include the privatisation of large state
enterprises such as the Odessa Portside Plant and Centrenergo, the lifting of the
embargo on the sale of agricultural land to foreigners, the raising of the pension
age, the restructuring of the health system and the increase in efforts combating
corruption.
Most of these reforms, although not expected to be completed in the immediate
term, they are expected to be implemented in a gradual process.
For example, land reform may be initiated partially by privatising state agricultural
land (1 billion hectares). 25% of world’s black-earth soil is in **Ukraine**, considered
the most fertile and productive agricultural land. Over 70% of **Ukraine** is
agricultural land valued at US$100 billion. **Ukraine** is the biggest exporter in
sunflower oil globally, 2 nd in world grain exporter after the US and 3 rd in corn
exports globally. The land reform is expected to elevate the country’s performance
with significant FDIs from international investors.
On the pension front, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the draft of the pension
reform-**IMF** and **World Bank** already supported the draft- and will discuss it at the
National Reform Council, to be
