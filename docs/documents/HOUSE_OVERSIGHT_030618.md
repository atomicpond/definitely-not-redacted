Dear Sirs: 
We are preparing an article about the calendaring **today** of Mr Edwards' claim against Mr **Epstein** for jury trial 
and the witness list which names________________and other young women who allege they were underage 
victims of Mr **Epstein**. 
Mr Edwards claims that Mr **Epstein** maliciously attempted to intimidate him and his clients into retracting their 
claims. 
Ms further has stated to us that she intends to testify that she was flown to **London** by Mr **Epstein** and 
instructed to have sex at **age 17** with Prince Andrew. She alleges that she was paid $15k for this encounter. 
She claims that on another occasion, Mr **Epstein** flew two young women to a dinner for the purpose of 
entertaining President **CLINTON**. She claims she herself was sex trafficked to several other men, whose contact 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 030618 
information is contained in an address book of Mr **Epstein**'s filed in court records. 
May we have a comment please? Our deadline is 1pm tomorrow (**Saturday**) ET.
