Subject: Re: following up: WA poetry release 
Open in principle depending on specially how and where it would be shown and how it would be advertised-
both subject to particular requirements and/or restrictions.Also dependent on approval of final cut. Would enter 
project with positive attitude but release would be reworked by lawyer.

To: jeevacation@gmail.com, ****Lisa** New** 
Dear **Jeffrey**, 
> 
My name is ****Leah Reis**-Dennis**, and I'll be heading operations for **Lisa**'s new non-profit, ****Verse Video Education****. 
She's asked me to be in touch with you about helping us get a release from **Woody** Allen. 
First, I wanted to send along the rough stringout of footage from the conversation with **Woody** a couple of years 
ago on "This is Just to Say" by William Carlos Williams. This is totally unedited and uncut footage, but we 
would love the opportunity to turn it into something great. 
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cObnljj xeo0654g/uWZ6KBVbLS?preview=WoodyAllen+Basic+Clip+for+Viewing.mov  
If **Woody** Allen agrees to let us use the footage, he will be in distinguished company. To date, we have filmed 
conversations about poetry with dozens of distinguished Americans including: 
Bill Clinton 
**Al Gore** 
**John McCain** 
Mayor **Rahm Emanuel** 
Mayor Tom Menino 
****Supreme Court** Justice** ****elena kagan** 
Sir** Mervyn King 
Former Secretary of the ****Treasury** **Larry Summers**** 
The conversation would be part of a large multiplatform initiative that **Harvard** Professor ****Lisa** New** has under 
way to bring poetry into the mainstream, and, especially, into **English Language Arts** classrooms in the **United 
States** and around the world. The initiative, Poetry in **America**, includes a HarvardX online course, a television 
series we're creating with **WGBH** to be paired with **PBS LearningMedia** segments for the classroom, and, a 
series of online professional development courses we're creating for ELA Middle and **High School** teachers and 
for their students. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 029839 
Let us know if **Woody** Allen might be open to our sending another release form his way. Of course, if he's 
interested in releasing the footage for only certain parts of our project, we're open to having a conversation 
about that, too. 
Thank you, and I hope to meet you soon. 
Best, Leah
