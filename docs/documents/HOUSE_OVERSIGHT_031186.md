﻿**California** woman accusing Donald **Trump** of raping her when she
was **13 years old** to break her silence
The woman behind a potentially damaging lawsuit accusing Donald **Trump** of raping her when she was an
underage teen will break her silence **today**, her lawyer said.
The **California** woman, known until now as “**Jane Doe**,” will finally give voice to long-denied allegations
that the Republican presidential nominee sexually assaulted her in **New York** during a series of sex parties
hosted by alleged billionaire pedophile **Jeffrey **Epstein**** in **1994**.
The woman filed a lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court in **June**. She is scheduled to speak at a Los
Angeles press conference this afternoon.
She said she was 13 at the time of the alleged attacks.
Lawsuit accusing **Trump** of raping girl, 13, gets **December** hearing
“Immediately following this rape, Defendant **Trump** threatened me that, were I ever to reveal any of the
details of Defendant **Trump**’s sexual and physical abuse of me, my family and I would be physically
harmed if not killed,” the plaintiff said in an affidavit.

The women accusing Donald **Trump** of sexual assault
She says that since **Trump** launched his campaign and received mass media coverage, she has been
“subjected to **daily** painful reminders of the horrific acts.”
A similar lawsuit by the woman was dismissed by a **Los Angeles** Federal Court in **May**.
A lawyer who was representing the woman at the time, Thomas Meagher, said the original suit, which she
filed without the help of an attorney, was dismissed because it cited statutes that did not apply to the case.
**Trump** campaign manager: There'd be no rape if women were stronger
**Alan Garten**, vice president and general counsel of the **Trump** Organization, has said the allegations were
“categorically untrue, completely fabricated and politically motivated.”
**Epstein**, who is also named as a defendant, has also denied the allegations. **Epstein** is alleged to have
preyed on dozens of underage girls in **the late 1990s** and early 2000s, but pleaded guilty to soliciting a
minor in just one case in **2008**.
But the woman’s new lawyer, Lisa Bloom, said the case against
**Trump** cannot be ignored. She has even launched a GoFundMe
page to raise money to support **Trump**’s sexual assault accusers.
“My law firm will proudly represent any accusers sued by Donald
**Trump** and crowd fund defense costs," Bloom tweeted. “Can’t wait
to take his deposition!”
