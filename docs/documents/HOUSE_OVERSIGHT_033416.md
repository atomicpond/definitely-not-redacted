Essay 1. 
Coming from an international background, and having lived in **Oslo**, ****Tel Aviv****, New York and **London** by **the age of eighteen**, I 
believe that the international profile of **NYU** will provide the best environment for my college education, with the added benefit of 
returning to the place where I've spent most of my childhood and where my mother will be posted as Norwegian Ambassador to the 
UN in January 2019. 
**NYU**'s Art History department appeals to me because of its wide range of courses, from the global art of antiquity to the 
contemporary. My passion is the Italian **Renaissance** and the rich history behind it, especially the works of 15th century masters 
such as Masaccio and Bellini. Some of the courses that **NYU** offers such as "Early masters of Italian **Renaissance** painting" and 
"Florentine Villas: An Interpretation Based on Historical, Social Factors" are, therefore appealing to me. What I find exciting, is not 
only the visual aesthetics and analysis of these masterpieces, but also the manner in which the **Renaissance** emphasised 
scientific and economic innovation, areas of study the Global Liberal Arts programme would offer. **NYU**'s unique campus in 
**Florence** would give me a once in lifetime opportunity to spend **a year** immersing myself in the art, culture and history of **Italy**. This 
would be an exciting experience to have while studying for a Bachelor's degree in Art History, and would compliment my main 
interests in the subject. 
As one of the prime cultural centres in the world, **NYU**'s location in **NYC** is the perfect place to broaden knowledge within 
contemporary art. I am very much looking forward to visiting the Whitney Biennia this May. In addition the New museum, which 
shows a lot of the kind of work I find interesting is a short walk away from campus. 
Taking advantage of being based in central **London** for **the past year**, I have completed the Chairman's Programme at Christies, 
work experience at the Courtauld Gallery and I will be working at Maddox Gallery in the near future. Similarly, I want to take 
advantage of being based in **NYC** to gain as much experience as possible. I have chosen to apply Early Decision to **NYU** as it is the 
only American university I will be applying to, as there is no better place to obtain experience of the contemporary art world than 
**New York City**. 
Essay 2. 
From the age of extremes to the age of bewilderment 
What captivates me more than anything else is the different ideological phases of **the 20th century** and how art can be used as 
a tool of advancement and reflection on ideological and political developments. 
My fascination began when I read; Eric Hobsbawm's "Age Of Extremes" and has since developed through books such as 
Benjamin Carter Heft's "The Death Of Democracy" and Yuval Harari "A Brief History Of Tomorrow" and "21 Lessons For 
**the 21st century**". 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033416 
In **the years** after the First World War, until **the end of** the Second World War, three political models for shaping the future of 
nation states emerged; Fascism, Communism and liberal democracy. These all offered great ideas for the future of the world. 
Fascism and Communism shared some common features: authoritarian, strong leaders and a belief that their revolutions had 
to be carried through with violence. This led to the mass murders in the Nazi concentration camps and in the Soviet Gulags. 
In the mid war periods, the "Litfass columns" that were originally designed to carry advertising, became the outdoor galleries 
for the war of ideologies. The political poster was born. High quality posters from every political party in **Germany** popped 
up on the columns. **Hitler**'s propaganda chief G8ebels stated that the Nazi election campaign should be run through speeches 
and posters. The other parties responded in kind. An art form thus became an essential political tool in the battle for votes. 
The propagandist Art used by the Nazis and communists alike was essential in helping sell their message to the masses. 
Indeed, much of the art that was critical of these movements was suppressed or censored and "subversive" artists cowed, in 
some cases imprisoned or even worse. 
The liberal democratic model departed sharply from these authoritarian perspectives by presenting the alternative of free and 
transparent elections, the rule of law and freedom of speech. In the mid-war period the three narratives were competing to be 
the conceptual frame for society. After the Second World War fascism was crushed leaving the two competing ideologies of
