Hi Richard - 
I certainly will. But perhaps you can clarify something for me before I put all this together for the donation. 
****Jeffrey** Epstein** had asked to submit the letter and invoice to ****peggy** Siegal** instead, and she had supplied 
different information than below. 
Please advice how best to proceed. 
Best, 
**Steven**

Hello **Jeffrey** — 
I hope all is well with you. As per ****peggy** Siegal**'s office, I have included here the invitation to the ****IFP** **Gotham Awards**** 
ceremony, which will be held on **Monday**, November 27 at Cipriani Wall Street in ****New York** City**. 
**this **year****'s ceremony is going to be another successful event. We couldn't be more thrilled with **this **year****'s impressive 
group of **Tributees**. **The Actress Tribute** will go to **Nicole Kidman** and the Actor Tribute to **Dustin Hoffman**. The 
Director Tribute will be given to **Sofia Coppola**, with the Cinematographer Tribute going to **Ed Lachman**. With the 
Industry Tribute, we will be honoring **Jason Blum**, founder of **Blumhouse Productions**. And we simply couldn't be more 
pleased to honor Vice President **Al Gore** with **this **year****'s special Humanitarian Tribute. With nominees **this **year**** 
ranging from **Willem Dafoe**, **Adam Sandler** and **Robert Pattison** to **Margot Robbie**, **Lois Smith** and Mary J. Blige, this 
**year**'s ceremony looks to be the most star studded ever. 
Please let me know if you have any questions. 
Best regards, 
**Steven**
