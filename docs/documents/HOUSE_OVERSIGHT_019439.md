﻿Money, money, money! 
Maureen 
Dowd 
**Washington** Clinton nostalgia is be-
ing replaced by Clinton neuralgia. 
Why is it that **America**'s roil family 
always seems better in abstract than in 
concrete? The closer it gets to running 
the world once more, the more you are 
reminded of all the things that bugged 
you the last time around. 
The Clintons' neediness, their sense 
of what they are owed in material 
terms for their public service, their as-
sumption that they're entitled to every-
one's money. 
Are we about to put the "For Rent" 
sign back on the Lincoln Bedroom? 
If Americans are worried about 
money in politics, there is no larger 
concern than the Clintons, who are cos-
seted in a world where rich people end-
lessly scratch the backs of rich people. 
They have a Wile E. Coyote problem; 
something is always blowing up. Just 
when the Clintons are supposed to be 
floating above it all, on a dignified cloud 
of do-gooding leading into **2016**, pop-pop-
pop, little explosions go off everywhere, 
reminding us of the troubling connec-
tions and values they drag around. 
There's the continuing grotesque 
spectacle of Anthony Weiner and Huma 
Abedin. And there's the sketchy in-
volvement of the Clintons' most prolific 
fund-raiser, Terry McAuliffe, and Hil-
lary's brother Tony Rodham in a ven-
ture, GreenTech Automotive; it's under 
federal investigation and causing fire-
works in **Virginia**, where McAuliffe is 
running for governor. 
Many Israelis were disgusted to learn 
that Bill Clinton was originally sched-
uled to scarf up $500,000 to speak at the 
Israeli president Shimon Peres's 90th 
be-
ingbirthday friends

foun-
dation. Isn't the J.N.F. "supposed to 
plant trees with donor cash?" **Haaretz** 
chided before the fund pulled back. "l 
guess money does grow on trees." 
I never thought I'd have to read the 
words Ira Magaziner again. But the 
man who helped Hillary torpedo her 
own health care plan is back. 
In an article in this newspaper last 
week headlined "Unease at Clinton 
Foundation," Nicholas Confessore and 
Amy Chozick offered a compelling 
chronicle about an internal review of 
the rechristened Bill, Hillary & **Chelsea** 
**Clinton Foundation** that illuminated the 
fungible finances and tensions between 
Clinton loyalists and the foundation ar-
chitects Magaziner and Doug Band, 
former bag carrier for President Clin-
ton. 
You never hear about problems with 
**Jimmy Carter**'s foundation; he just 
quietly goes around the world eradicat-
ing Guinea worm disease. But 
Magaziner continues to be a Gyro 
Gearloose, the inept inventor of Donald 
Duck's Duckburg. 
"On one occasion, Mr. Magaziner dis-
patched a team of employees to fly 
around the world for **months** gathering 
ideas for a climate change proposal that 
never got off the grouhd," Oonfessore 
and Chozick said. 
We are supposed to believe that every 
dollar given to a Clinton is a dollar that 
improves the world. But is it? Clinton-
world is a galaxy where personal en-
richment and political advancement 
blend seamlessly, and where a cast of 
jarringly familiar characters pad their 
pockets every which way to **Sunday**. 
"Efforts to insulate the foundation 
from potential conflicts have high-
lighted just how difficult it can be to dis-
entangle the Clintons' charity work 
from Mr. Clinton's moneymaking ven-
tures and Mrs. Clinton's political fu-
ture," Confessore and Chozick wrote. 
The most_ evripous :seat el MOMS 
was a firm founded by Doug sad 
called Teneo, a saunmy blond at cow rate consulting. public rib:loos and merchant banking. Band. a surrogate 
son to Bill. put Hume, a surrogate 
daughter to Hillary. on the payroll. 
Even Big Daddy Bill was a paid adviset 
As this newspaper reported,Teneo 
worked on retainer charging **monthly** 
fees up to $250,000 and recruiung clients 
from among **Clinton Foundation** donors. 
while encouraging others to become 
foundation donors. The Clintons dis-
tanced themselves from Teneo when 
they got scorched 
with had publicity 
after the collapse of 
its client MF 
the international 
brokerage firm led by 
the former New Jer: 
sey governor Jon 
Corzine. 
And **Chelsea** is now t 
shaping the founda-
tion's future, and her 
political future. So 
there may not be as much oxygen for 
her troublesome surrogate siblings. 
As George Packer wrote in The New 
Yorker, Bill Clinton earned $17 million 
**last year** giving speeches, including one 
to a Lagos company for $700,000. Hil-
lary gets $200,000 a speech. 
Until Harry Truman wrote his mem-
oirs, the ex-president struggled on an 
**Army** pension of $112.56 a month. "1 
copid never letnimitelf anyctrxesac-
