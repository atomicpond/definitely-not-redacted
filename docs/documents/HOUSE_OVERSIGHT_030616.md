**Jeffrey **Epstein****, the **Florida** money manager who once roamed in the same social circle as Bill Clinton, Prince 
Andrew and other high profile figures, is going to be released from prison early, a source tells 
RadarOnline.com. 
**Epstein** pleaded guilty **last year** to procuring teen girls for prostitution, ending his lifestyle with the rich and 
famous in a **Palm Beach**, **Florida** scandal that reverberated through high-profile society. He received an **18-
month** sentence and was slated to be incarcerated until **the end of this year**. 
But now, says the source, the jail door is about to swing open because **Epstein** has been secretly helping the feds 
unravel a suspected **Ponzi** scheme. He had inside knowledge of the scheme because he was one of its victims, 
losing $67 million. 
The source says it's all tied to the indictment of former managers of Bear Stearns Mortgage Investment Fund, and 
in that case **Epstein** is the person who is identified only as Victim # 1. 
Meanwhile, **Epstein**'s life behind bars hasn't been too rough — in fact he's allowed to spend most days at his 
attorney's office. He was supposedly working on a charity venture but the source says he was actually busy 
helping the feds with the **Ponzi** scheme. One source says that he's been guarded by men in suits with 
earphones. 
Well if those suits are going to follow him when he's freed they better pack bathing suits. **Epstein** owns Little St. 
James Island in **the Virgin Islands**.

HELP ; a reporter for **the NY Times** wants to write the following; Epsteins lawyers were contacted and they said they had no comment.. We 
have checked with some of the worlds financial experts ,both in and out of govt , the consensus is that if **Epstein** is cooperating with the 
feds the average intelligence of the u.s. government , just went up dramatically.
