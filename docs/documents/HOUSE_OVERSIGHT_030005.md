Ribis's Italian immigrant parents taught him to be tightfisted, but it was the **DONALD** who introduced him to 
dealmaking. As a kid in the ****New Jersey**** suburbs, Ribis rose before dawn to count the empty soda bottles at the 
family deli "so the suppliers couldn't cheat my mom on the deposits." When **Trump** faced bankruptcy in **1989**, 
he turned to the team of Ribis and Steve Bollenbach, now CEO of Hilton Hotels, to fend off the banks and 
bondholders. Ribis helped persuade creditors to let **Trump** keep his trophy holding: his casinos. It was the 
gaming company's **IPO** in **1995**, orchestrated by Ribis, that restored **Trump**'s wealth.
