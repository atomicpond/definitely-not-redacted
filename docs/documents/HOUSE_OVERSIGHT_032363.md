Importance: High 
**Putin**? **NATO**? Those were the points my sister raised that were concerning. 
Will meet you in **Boston** or **NYC** sometime. Curious to hear your thinking.

I am looking at this from over here in **Germany**. American politics gets reduced in the end to only a few issues: 
pro-life or pro-choice, gun laws, and establishment vs. anti-establishment. Political categories are so wishy 
washy and intermingled with what is termed 'liberal' and 'conservative' that one forgets what they actually 
mean. 
Of course, not everybody who voted for **Trump** is sexist or a racist, but, on some level, they didn't care if he is. 
He knew how to gather momentum with the discourse he chose, and, even if he changes his tone, he has let 
loose a storm. We will brace ourselves over here for **Putin**'s eventual takeover of the Baltic States. **Putin** has 
extended his power back into Republic of Georgia, the **Crimea**, and Armenia. **Trump** has said that he would 
not come to the aid of **NATO** allies if they were attacked. IS is the least of our problems here in **Germany**; 
Erdogan is a much larger threat, for now. 
I don't see **Hillary Clinton** as being at fault. I see the growth of nationalism (all throughout the world, not just 
in the **USA**) and an underestimation of the fear that non-Hispanic whites have about the trajectory they are on 
to become a minority (in the **USA** and other European countries). 
Every news show, talk show, etc here is discussing and analysing the fallout of **Trump**'s win. German 
politicians are hoping to learn from it, to stem the growth of the right wing AFD party here. As far as I know, 
**Merkel** is the only leader who congratulated **Trump** with a warning.
