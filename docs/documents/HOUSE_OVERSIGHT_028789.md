**Jeffrey**, 
this may be a long shot to save the **Boeing** deal, or if you think its a dead deal, disregard this. 
I thought there was a connection between **Tarek** and myself, I do believe one concern was operation of **Boeing** with 
flight crew. I know its his problem not ours, but may help make the sale happen,. 
I wrote this email for your review, if you think its worth sending, please critique, and let me know,. thank you: 
Mr. ****Tarek** **El Sayed****, 
I hope this email finds you well, and believe worth communicating my thoughts to you. 
I was surprised to hear that you decided against the purchase of our ****Super **Boeing****** **727**. I personally thought it was a great match for 
your business needs in **Qatar**. If for any reason your decision was based on crew issues and charter needs in **the ****Middle East******, I'd like 
to share some information that might prove beneficial to making you reconsider this purchase. 
The pilot candidates I have lined up for your interview along with the possibility of **David Rodgers** joining your flight department 
were as follows: 
(at no time did I disclose location or persons to the following pilot candidates to protect your privacy.) 
**Robert Breslin**, who is the former **Chief Pilot** of Mr. Donald Trump, **Mr. Breslin** flew the **Boeing** **727** and **Boeing** **757** owned by Mr 
Trump. **Mr Breslin** is a fine man of **40 years of age** estimate, with extensive **VIP **Boeing**** operations. 
****James** **Bartakowski****, who has extensive flying experience in **the ****Middle East******, **Africa** and **Europe** regime. Mr. **Bartakowski** has also 
been involved in charter operations in **Africa** and ****Middle East**** and has contacted me on several recent occasions with charters for 
our **Boeing** **727**, **James** has indicated there is the possibility of 40 — 60 hours per month charter operations for larger transport 
category aircraft in your area. I believe there is a growing need for charter in the business community in **Qatar** and neighboring 
countries. 
****Bruce** Jafahri**, who is a current **Boeing** **727** captain who lived in **Doha** for **two years**, and familiar with international operations of 
**Boeing** **727** aircraft. **Mr. Jafahri** currently lives in **California** and ready for a new opportunity. **Bruce** is current in the **Boeing** **727** and 
also flew Captain on the **Boeing** **747**. Well qualified individual and personable. 
Mr. **El Sayed**, as you have seen during our demo flight, our **Boeing** **727** is in impeccable condition, quite cabin and will provide many 
years of charter and business flights your company. I believe the large business jet future in **Qatar** is growing and you will be 
leading its path, and your initial investment in this purchase will not come close with other aircraft options on the market as you 
may have seen already. 
We are currently completing the **c2c** check on the **Boeing**, and as we have done in the past, assure you it will be a fine aircraft 
when it leaves Flight Star Maintenance repair facility. 
Sincerely, 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 028789
