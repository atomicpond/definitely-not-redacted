**Thanks **Darren**** 
Good news! 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032497 
I'm under the impression that checks will be exceptional (they are more cumbersome to handle), and we will 
use mostly wires. 
Considering the time difference, my heavy travel and my own propension to do things at night and on week-
ends I would much prefer having an internet code and be able to organize everything online when I need to. 
When I use **Interaudi** (my US bank), they can do that, store the recurring beneficiaries, and do wires in 
multiple currencies, but I am not familiar with DB. 
Of course, you could also have the same access and help me when needed. 
Also, your point about bookkeeping is mitigated by the fact that, in any case, I will also need to have 
someone keeping track of the receipts and inventory, before shipping proofs to you. In any case there will be 
need for some work on my side before final filing is done. 
On the other hand, if there is a "checks and balances" control issue, there could be a cap to my wiring powers 
(like the 10 K we discussed), that would be absolutely fine for me if this is the intent. 
Please do let me know. 
We can also talk about it (in Hawai now, free after 2 PM your time) 
In any case, this is good and happy news. I'll review the first list of payments over the **week-end**.

There is $1mm in the bank account. We can prepare checks or wires for you to sign upon request. This way 
book keeping gets done at same time. Just send back up with each request. How does that sound?

Latest from JE (indeed, encouraging) 
Please let me know when account/wire are active, and how I can access internet banking and start the ball (in 
fact, it has started)

**Hi Jeffrey** 
Happy to talk to you almost anytime **today** until around 3PM. Just tell me what number I should reach. 
Not sure what got lost in translation here: never had the intention to go to any
