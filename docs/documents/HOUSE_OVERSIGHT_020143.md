HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020143 
Hot event alert: RSVP to our 2/26 event in NYC for interviews with NBA star 
Draymond Green, BBG Ventures' Susan Lyne, **JPMorgan**'s Jennifer Piepszak, and 
Equinox CEO Harvey Spevak. 
Top of the Morning

AT&T's proposed $85 billion purchase of ****Time Warner**** took another turn **yesterday**. A 
federal judge hearing **the **Justice Department**'s** lawsuit to block the deal denied a 
request by the telecom giant to disclose communications between **Justice Department** 
officials, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and **the **White House**** about the 
deal. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020144 
• Why it matters: The ruling is a blow to AT&T's attempt to show that the 
lawsuit to block the deal is politically motivated by **President Trump**'s antipathy for 
CNN, which ****Time Warner**** owns. AT&T says it wasn't asked to offload any assets as 
part of the deal until after Trump took office. 
• What they're saying: "We respect the judge's decision and look forward to 
the upcoming trial," said Dan Petrocelli, who is leading AT&T and ****Time Warner****'s 
defense in the case, in a statement. 
• At a hearing on Friday, a **Justice Department** lawyer said that AT&T's 
argument for the documents "didn't make sense." 
• Go deeper: Our report from the courtroom on Friday, when DOJ and AT&T 
presented their arguments. 
Fund scoop: Niv Dror, who joined AngelList through its acquisition of Product Hunt 
in 2016, is raising a small early-stage fund focused on consumer products, multiple 
sources tell Axios. Dror declined to comment. 
• The fund will raise at least $1 million, though one source says it could go up to 
$2-3 million. 
• Like Product Hunt colleague Ryan Hoover's own VC fund, Dror's will be 
managed on the back-end by AngelList. 
Same old story: **yesterday**, I grabbed coffee with Day One Ventures founder Masha 
Drokova, and heard a familiar—and still disappointing—story: While raising her fund, 
she was told by prospective investors that she should get a male co-founder. 
• She initially considered the suggestion, she told me, before remembering it's 
rooted in sexism. 
**Softbank** $$$: **Softbank**'s Vision Fund is in early talks to raise additional funds from 
**Bahrain**'s sovereign wealth fund, Mumtalakat, the latter's CEO told **Reuters**. 
• **the Persian Gulf** has been a major source of funds for the Vision Fund: Public 
Investment Fund, **Saudi Arabia**'s main sovereign wealth fund, and **Abu Dhabi**'s 
Mubadala, are already investors. 
• And it's not the only one visiting the region's investors—funds focused on tokens 
and cryptocurrencies have also been fundraising in the area, I'm told. 
Unicorn stampede: We're not even **two months** into 2018 and yet, seven startups 
have already seen their private valuations cross the $1 billion mark—earning "unicorn" 
status—according to Pitchbook. **last year**: 53. The word "overvalued" comes to mind...

The BFD 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020145

**Broadcom** has adjusted its takeover offer for Qualcomm to $79 per share, down from 
the its "best and final" bid of $82. The move is a response to Qualcomm's 
announcement **yesterday** it would pay $127.50 a share for NXP, up from the $ilo it 
had offered. 
• Why it's the BFD: **Broadcom** and Qualcomm's takeover dance has taken a 
dramatic turn for what should have been a boring transaction between two chip 
companies. 
• Bottom line: "**Broadcom** has long said its acquisition of the ****San Diego****-based 
chipmaker is contingent on Qualcomm buying NXP at the previously agreed price, 
saving a large amount of cash **Broadcom** could hypothetically use for its own purposes 
once the acquisition goes through... Qualcomm raised its NXP bid to secure support 
from activist investors who have piled into NXP and demanded a higher sale price." — 
Bloomberg.

funding led by Intel Capital, with participation from Sequoia, BMW
