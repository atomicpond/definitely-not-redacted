Lawyers for Imam Wanted by Turkish 
Authorities Fear for Their Client's Life 
Fethullah **Gulen** has been accused by Turkish President **Erdogan** of 
ordering the launch of July coup 
DEVLIN BARRETT 
Aug. 5, 2016 1:34 p.m. ET 
Lawyers for the imam living in **Pennsylvania** whom Turkish authorities accuse of directing a coup **last month** in 
that country said **Friday** they fear for his life and may ask U.S. authorities to help protect him. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 031480 
Since the failed coup that led to the deaths of 271 people, Turkish President **Recep **Tayyip **Erdogan****** has accused 
the imam, Fethullah **Gulen**, of issuing instructions to launch the coup, a charge Mr. **Gulen** has denied. 
Turkish authorities have demanded the U.S. extradite Mr. **Gulen** immediately to **Turkey**, but The Wall Street 
**Journal** reported **Thursday** that U.S. officials don't expect to do that, citing people familiar with the discussions. 
U.S. officials see problems with the evidence presented thus far by **Turkey**, and they are concerned 
about strident public statements made by Turkish leaders against Mr. **Gulen**, those people said. 
Mr. **Erdogan** has called Mr. **Gulen** and his supporters a terrorist network, a charge U.S. officials have long 
discounted. **Turkey** in May officially designated Mr. **Gulen**'s network a terrorist organization, making 
membership a crime under Turkish law. 
Mr. **Erdogan**'s government has pressed the Obama administration since the coup to extradite Mr. **Gulen**, 
arguing that pursuing the imam is part of the broader campaign against terrorism. At times, the Turkish leader's 
aides have said **Ankara** would view as hostile any foreign government that gave sanctuary to leaders of the 
**Gulen** movement. 
**Turkey** hasn't yet made a formal extradition request to the U.S., and Turkish officials say they plan to provide 
more evidence to **the Justice Department**. 
Mr. **Gulen**, 75 years old, came to the U.S. in 1999, and has a devoted following in **Turkey** and other countries. 
At a press conference in **Washington** on **Friday**, Mr. **Gulen**'s lawyers said they have spoken to the Justice 
Department about the demands for extradition but are unaware of the U.S. government's thinking or plans. 
Asked if they feared for his life, one of Mr. **Gulen**'s lawyers, ****Reid** **Weingarten**** said, "We do. We're very 
concerned about his safety." The lawyer said they are discussing whether to ask U.S. authorities for help in 
safeguarding their client. 
A Turkish court has issued a warrant for Mr. **Gulen**'s arrest, and Turkish and U.S. authorities have privately 
discussed scenarios in which Mr. **Gulen** might be extradited. But several U.S. officials said they cannot now 
envision a scenario in which they turn him over to **Turkey**. 
"It would be unprecedented and appalling if the U.S. took a frail, almost octogenarian, plopped him on a plane 
to go back into that kind of setting with the hideous things that are being said about him by the entire Turkish 
government," said Mr. **Weingarten**. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 031481 
"The bluster, the conspiracy theories, and the threats of Mr. **Erdogan** are not strong enough to overwhelm the 
American legal system," he added. "And for that reason we believe that Mr. **Gulen** should not and will not be 
extradited." 
Mr. **Weingarten** said the chances that his client helped plot a coup from his base in the Poconos is "about as 
likely" as a meteor striking the lawyer's office while he was speaking.
