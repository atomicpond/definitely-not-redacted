Subject: From **Fox News** - **Jeffrey Epstein**, registered sex offender, settles civil lawsuit and avoids testimony from alleged 
victims 
Importance: High 
Hope you are satisfied with the outcome all things considered. 
Ridiculous article. All of sudden the **NPA** in 's case goes from no 
jurisdiction even to prosecute to you avoiding a possible life 
sentence. Moronic. 
Man I sure would like to see you getting some in the W column though and 
some press that at least presents the true facts that some of the girls have 
admitted under oath. Still a story no one ever has heard and they are 
compelling facts. 
Good Shabbos. 
The numerous young women who say they were sexually abused by 
wealthy, **CLINTON**-linked financier **Jeffrey Epstein** no longer appear set to 
testify after a last-minute settlement was reached in a closely-watched civil 
lawsuit against the registered sex offender.
