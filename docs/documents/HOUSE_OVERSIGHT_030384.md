The taxes are ready to go according to RJ and **tom**. There were two changes made **last Friday**: $4mm of RA and 
Artspace losses can/shld reduce the 3.8% **Medicare** tax and $7mm of TRA payments shld also be exempt from 
**Medicare** taxes (consistent with prior year APO and Akin Gump advice). In aggregate this increases our 
overpayment by $400k. 
Pls call me and I'll find rich and **tom** if you want to discuss. Thx, b 
Otherwise, taxes are complete and we are ready to press the button and file electronically. B
