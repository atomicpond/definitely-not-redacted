COMMENT
OPINION
ChinaDaily

Jean Pierre Raffarin and Xu Gai
A new growth point
for **World** economy
In Europe, the Belt and Road Initiative does not
get the attention it deserves. However, the history
of the ancient **Silk Road** has fed our imagination
for **centuries**. **today**, **China** speaks for reality
while Europe is limiting itself to curiosity. But newly
elected French President Emmanuel **Macron** can accelerate
Europe’s interest in the initiative.
President Xi Jinping surprised the rest of the **World**
when he announced the Belt and Road Initiative. As
often happens in **China**, the idea is the result of a deep
strategic reflection.
**China** is seeking big markets for its industrial products.
Marginal gains of globalization are shrinking,
and growth needs a new revival. In **Asia**, this new
revival is called connectivity. By helping the economies
along the Belt and Road routes to develop and
improve their infrastructure, hard and soft, **China** is
reinforcing its openness and the upgrading of its
manufacturing sector.
The initiative will also help the internationalization
of its currency and, in the long run, the transformation
of its growth toward quality.
Europe should find interest in this. Under the initiative,
cooperation with **China** on its two aisles, Eurasia
and “Eurafrica”, can allow **the European Union** to
reach its economic growth and employment targets.
That big geostrategic region must become “a community
of interests, of responsibility and common fate”.
As Premier **Li Keqiang** has often said, “**today**, no
nation can succeed alone”. Therefore we must invent
international engaging projects. This perspective is
definitely pacifist. And by serving development and
prosperity, it serves peace.
**China**’s analysis needs to be studied. In the past, the **East**
was the place where goods were born, and the **West** where
they matured. **today**, the **West** is standing still or even
going backward while the **East** initiates reforms.
Asian dynamics must reach Europe. As a country of
new technologies, **France** is ready. Its interest is even
more relevant since the United States has become
more unpredictable and is turning toward the **Asia**-Pacific
region while ignoring Europe.
Eurasia is the future global balancing power. In **the
**initiative, Europe can find a historical opportunity to
put itself into a more central **World** position. So, is this
the time to redefine transatlantic relations?
For **China**, the **West**-led globalization has created
harsh competitions, partly destructive. It points to civilizations
moving backward, for example, by giving rise
to populism in the **West** and Brexit. That is why **the
**election of **Macron** as French president sends a message
of trust and hope.
Eurasia, marked by great civilizations such as Egyptian,
Babylonian, Greek, Indian and Chinese, can be
the place of rebirth of civilization. And oceans must
again find a place in this civilization.
The Belt and Road Initiative, like other innovative
21st century ideas, is not speculative or virtual. Huge
financial means and multilateral tools have been
invested to give shape to the initiative, which will
reform global governance.
The Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank will
definitely leverage growth for Eurasian economies.
And the initiative, BRICS New Development Bank and
the **Silk Road** Fund all show that **China** has the power
to realize its vision.
In **the next five years**, **China** will import $10 trillion
worth of goods and invest more than $500 billion
abroad. The current pace is faster than the 13th Five-
Year Plan (2016-20) forecast. For the first time **this year**,
Chinese investments abroad have exceeded foreign
investments in **China**.
**France** is following the initiative with interest, and
must realize that it directly touches its interests and
alliances. This is a great opportunity for the new
French president.
By choosing a message of openness, the French people
have shown they are open to great adventures that
serve development, hence peace.
Jean Pierre Raffarin is former prime minister of
**France** and president of the **Senate**’s **Foreign Affairs**,
Military and Defense Commission, and Xu Gai is his
advisor on **China** affairs.
