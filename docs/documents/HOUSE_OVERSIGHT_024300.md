Bookstore owner calls police after customer 
confronted Steve Bannon 
By Morgan Gstalteduly 07, 2018 - 10:38 PM EDT 
A **Richmond**, Va., bookstore owner said he called the police on **Saturday** after former White 
House chief strategist Stephen Bannon was confronted in his store. 
Nick Cooke, owner of Black Swan Books, told the **Richmond** Times-Dispatch that a woman 
called Bannon a "piece of trash." 
The woman then left the store after Cooke said he called 911. 
"Steve Bannon was simply standing, looking at books, minding his own business. I asked 
her to leave, and she wouldn't. And I said, 'I'm going to call the police if you don't,' and I 
went to call the police and she left," Cooke said. "And that's the end of the story." 
Bannon grew up in **Richmond**, the newspaper noted. 
The **Richmond** Police Department confirmed the call was made but the call was canceled 
before officers responded. 
"We are a bookshop. Bookshops are all about ideas and tolerating different opinions and not 
about verbally assaulting somebody, which is what was happening," Cooke said.
