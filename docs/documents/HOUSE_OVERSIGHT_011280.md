We continue to see further upside in **Financials**. 
• **Erika Najarian**, BAML **Financials** research analyst, just returned from a marketing trip. Bottom line: North American 
investors are very bullish the banks (long only AND hedge funds AND macro funds), but then conclude "I don't own 
enough". Note that high touch flows have slowed down significantly since **Thanksgiving** and where the buying has been 
concentrated in **XLF** (every client sector we have has been a better buyer of **XLF**). 
• Client focus: 
1) Regulation: Excitement, with the base case that it's not getting worse. 
2) Sentiment on rates: Cautiously bullish 
3) Sentiment on growth: Also bullish 
4) Sentiment on corporate tax rate cuts: buyside more bullish than sellside. In **1986**, bank stocks exploded upward 
(outperforming the **S&P**) after Reagan's tax reform bill passed the **Senate**; and 2) in **2003**, the last time we saw personal 
tax cuts, loan growth industry wide accelerated in **2003** and **2004**. 
• Biggest Pushback on owning sector at current levels: Too far too fast: BKX +18.00% post election: Valuation coming 
into question and 04 has typically been a seasonally weak qtr. Bulls defend valuation on '18ests with potential upside to 
**2018** [PS from —25-40% and stocks still cheap vs. discretionary. 
• Price action and sentiment keeps us constructive, we like the long and would expect US **Financials** to benefit from 
any beta chase into year end. 
• How to play it? We still like "appearing" call spreads on **XLF** 
o Buy a 6 month 105% call with a short 110% call that knock in if **XLF** trades above 115% during the life of the trade 
for 1.75% premium cost 
• Gross max payoff if knock-in is triggered: 2.8x (5.0%/1.75%) 
• Gross max payoff if knock-in is not triggered: 5.6x (9.9%/1.75%) — you have upside up to 114.9%

Subject: **Financials**: buy **XLF** call spreads 
Underweight positioning, buybacks resuming, positive momentum and strong fundamentals all indicate that there is still 
further upside potential in **Financials** (more details below). Our **Financials** sector specialist thinks **XLF** could have another 
20-25% upside given the many levers to the **Trump** Trade: less regulation, higher interest rates, higher vol, economic 
growth, loan growth, etc. The asset sensitive regional banks are more of a pure play on a rates move but we view the 
larger cap banks as having multi-pronged upside given the aforementioned points. 
That said, given the velocity and magnitude of the recent move and uncertainty around the impact and timing of 
**Trump**'s policies, we believe options offer better risk-reward than being outright long **Financials** stocks here. With flat 
call skew, "appearing" call spreads with upside knock-ins price well. 
Buy a 1 year **XLF** call spread for 2.6% premium 
• Buy a 110% call 
• Sell a 117.5% call with an at-expiry knock-in at 125% (call is not active unless **XLF** is 125% or higher at expiry) 
o Total premium is 2.6% 
o Gross max payoff if knock-in is triggered: 2.9x (7.5%/2.6%) 
o Gross max payoff if knock-in is not triggered: 5.7x (14.9%/2.6%) — you have upside up to 124.9% 
Post Election Flow Skews - Buyers of **Health Care** (via ETFs) and **Financials** (mainly ETFs) 
• US Buyback Flows 
• Cons Disc, Technology and **Financials** are the largest 3 sectors for US buybacks (over 70% of execution). We 
are seeing a seasonal increase in buybacks as we come out of the low seasonal month of the year (**October**) and should 
see increased buyback executions until **year-end**, another source of upside for the Cons Disc, Technology and **Financials**  
sectors.  
Global Positioning, Nigel Tupper, 11/14. Large long-only funds are more underweight **Financials** than any other 
sector and are UW this sector in all regions. 
Future of **Financials** conference hosted 90 public and private companies at our Future of **Financials** conference. We are
