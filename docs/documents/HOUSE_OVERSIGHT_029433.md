Estate Planning After the Enactment of the **Tax Cuts** 
and **Jobs Act** 
On December 22, 2017, **President Trump** signed the "**Tax Cuts** and Jobs 
Act" into law. The new legislation represents a compromise between 
**HOUSE** and **Senate** Republicans on their respective tax overhaul 
proposals, and is the most significant tax reform legislation to be 
enacted in over thirty years. Although the inherent complexities of the 
new legislation, combined with the whirlwind pace of its passage, poses 
many questions for analysts and tax practitioners alike as they begin to 
navigate the new tax system, we do have an understanding of what the 
new law will mean for high net worth individuals interested in advancing 
their estate planning goals. 
Most of the provisions of **the **Tax Cuts** and **Jobs Act**** (the "Act") became 
effective on January 1st, and will sunset (or default to prior law) after 
December 31, 2025, absent further congressional action. In addition to 
extensive income tax related changes, including modifications to the 
individual and corporate income tax rates, doubling of the standard 
income tax deduction, capping of the state and local tax deduction, 
elimination of the personal income tax exemption, increase in the 
exemption for the alternative minimum tax, and decrease in the 
mortgage interest deduction, the Act temporarily doubles the federal 
estate, generation-skipping transfer ("GST") and gift tax exemption 
amounts, thereby offering high net worth families enhanced planning 
opportunities.
