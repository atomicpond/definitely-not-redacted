HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030098 
A federal jury decided **Thursday** that one of **the ****Middle East******'s most prominent banks did not commit fraud and 
steal technology from an **Irvine** firm that sued it for half a billion dollars in damages after their partnership 
collapsed. 
**Orange County** company **InfoSpan** had alleged that ****Emirates** NBD** ended a partnership for a mobile payment 
system because it didn't want to share revenue and stole **InfoSpan**'s technology to launch its own service. 
The Dubai-based bank, in turn, denied it stole or ever used **InfoSpan**'s technology. It argued that it cancelled the 
partnership because **InfoSpan** couldn't produce a working product and misled it into thinking it was an 
established company, not one with little to no track record. 
After deliberating for a day, the jury unanimously decided that **InfoSpan** did not prove its case of fraud and theft 
of trade secrets. 
**InfoSpan** had asked for $540 million in damages. An attorney for **InfoSpan** declined to comment on the 
possibility of an appeal. 
The verdict capped a **two-week** trial that involved dueling accusations of fraud levied by high-profile attorneys 
on both sides, including the **Former ****White House****** counsel to **President Obama**. 
At the center of the high-stakes battle was San Juan Capistrano resident and entrepreneur **Farooq Bajwa** and a 
mobile payment system that he said would allow migrant workers in **the ****Middle East****** to send remittances back 
home through text messages. 
Bajwa contended that **InfoSpan**, with support from outside investors, spent $87 million developing the business 
and technology. 
To launch the system, known as **SpanCash**, Bajwa partnered in 2007 with ****Emirates** Bank**, which is controlled 
by **the **United Arab **Emirates******' sovereign wealth fund. 
It seemed the ideal collaboration for the Pakistani immigrant, who earned millions operating another **Irvine** 
company that manufactured computer components in **the 1980s** and 1990s 
The Gulf States rely heavily on migrants to work construction and other low-wage jobs, offering a ready-made 
market for **SpanCash**. **InfoSpan** aimed to allow migrants to transfer money back home far more cheaply than 
**Western Union** or hawala, a traditional **Middle Eastern** broker-to-broker money transfer system. 
A study from McKinsey & Co., cited in court records, projected annual revenue of $3.5 billion by the deal's 
**fifth year**, with **InfoSpan** receiving more than $2.8 billion in fees. 
But the relationship between **InfoSpan** and ****Emirates** Bank** soured and the bank cancelled the deal in 2009. 
**A few days later**, **Emirates** filed a criminal complaint in Dubai against Bajwa and a partner alleging that they 
defrauded the bank and misrepresented **InfoSpan** as an established business with a working technology. 
**Two years later**, **InfoSpan** sued in U.S. ****District Court**** in **Santa Ana** and alleged that its technology was working 
and that it delivered its source code to the bank on servers. **Emirates** ended the deal, **InfoSpan** said, to launch its 
own mobile payment system after stealing **InfoSpan**'s technology. 
In court, an attorney for **InfoSpan** argued that **Emirates** torpedoed the **InfoSpan** relationship because it abhorred 
how much money it would have to share with the **Irvine** firm. 
"They wanted **SpanCash** and they wanted the money," attorney William A. Isaacson said in his closing 
arguments **Wednesday**. 
Isaacson — a partner with powerhouse law firm **Boies Schiller** & Flexner, chaired by high-profile litigator David 
Boies — argued that the bank resorted to "pure extortion" in an attempt to get its way. 
As a result of the bank's criminal complaint, **InfoSpan** alleged Bajwa's partner, **Larry **Scudder****, was detained at 
the Dubai International Airport and taken t
