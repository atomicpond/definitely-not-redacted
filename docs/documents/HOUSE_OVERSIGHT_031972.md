Suit Against **California** 
Relies on a Court Case 
Won by Obama in **2012** 
tr. sac 
..Sre•pfzera shacleee, a law profes-
ses-et the Chzieersity of Tetras, said 
history was repeating itself, but 
backward. 
"The suit is modeled on the 
Marna administration's success-
ful suit against **Arizona**," he said. 
But he added that "some of the 
key considerations are flipped." 
In the **Arizona** case, conserva-
tives insisted that respect for state 
sovereignty required letting 
states play a leading role in con-
trolling immigration within their 
borders. But Mr. Sessions, a long-
time conservative himself, disa-
vowed that position in his speech 
on **Wednesday**. "Immigration law 
is the province of the federal gov-
ernment," he said. 
Justice Antonin Scalia, the con-
servative jurist who died in **2016**, 
took a different view of the Ari-
zona case. In an impassioned par-
tial dissent, he wrote that "it is 
easy to lose sight of the states' tra-
ditional role in regulating immi-
gration — and to overlook their 
sovereign prerogative to do so." 
There is no doubt that the Cali-
fornia lawsuit is at odds with some 
of the **Trump** administration's 
usual positions. "It's a fascinating 
suit on a number of levels," Profes-
sor Vladeck said, "not the least of 
aznalosous contexts, 
Cristina nearigoes, a law pro-
at '**Yale** said she detected 
political parallels between the two 
suits. 
"Both administrations claim 
that the state laws they challenge 
impermissibly interfere with the 
executive branch's ability to en-
force the immigration laws," she 
said. "But both lawsuits are also 
clearly designed to take on visible 
and politically powerful local offi-
cials whose vision of immigration 
policy conflicts with the presi-
dent's and his supporters'." 
In a news conference on 
**Wednesday**, Xavier Becerra, the 
**California** attorney general, said 
he was ready for the fight. The 
state's laws, he said, were "fully 
constitutional and provide for the 
safety and welfare of all our peo-
ple." 
"**California** is in the business of 
public safety," he said. "We are not 
in the business of deportations?' 
**the Justice Department** chal-
lenged parts of three of Califor-
nia's so-called sanctuary laws. 
One restricts employers from co-
operating with immigration offi-
cials. A second generally prohibits 
state officials from telling federal 
ones when undocumented immi-
grants are to be released from

the commandeering issue was a 
substantial one. "To the ?xtenttlie-,_ 
**Trump** administration s claims 
against **California** would produce 
an outcome that would effectively 
force states and localities to par-
ticipate m immigration enforce-
ment; she said,'. there couldhe an 
unconstitutional commandeer-
ing:" 
Professor Spiro said that Cali-
fornia may have the upper hand in 
the suit's early stages, as the is-
sues in it are novel, leaving judges 
with substantial discretion. 
The **Trump** administration has 
not fared well in federal courts in 
**California** in other cases concern-
ing immigration, including ones 
challenging President **Trump**'s ef-
forts to restrict travel from pre-
dominantly Muslim countries and 
to rescind a program protecting 
some 700,000 young unauthorized 
immigrants from deportation. 
But the ultimate fate of the suit 
will probably rest with the Su-
preme Court. In **2012**, with what 
may have been unwarranted opti-
mism Justice **Kennedy** said he 
hoped that conflicts over immi-
gration policy would be worked 
out through reasoned discussion. 
"The national government has 
significant power to regulate im-
migration," he wrote. "The sound 
exercise of national power over 
immigration depends on the na-
tion's meeting its responsibility to 
base its laws on a political will in-
formed by searching, thoughtful, 
rational civic discourse?'

cilities that house people detained 
on behalf of the federal govern-
ment. 
Jennifer Chacon, a law profes-
sor at **the University of **California****, 
**Irvine**, said the state laws had 
been carefully written to avoid di-
rect conflicts with federal immi-
gration laws. "I think it is clear 
that **California** deliberately tried 
to draft laws that involved core ex-
ercises of state police power in a 
way that did not run afoul of fed-
eral law," she said. 
Each state law presents differ-
ent issues, and courts may give 
varying answers depending on 
how directly the state laws con-
flict with federal ones. More gen-
erally, though, courts will take ac-
count of ****the Supreme Court**'s** deci-
sion in the **Arizona** case, which 
called for collaboration rather 
than conflict.
