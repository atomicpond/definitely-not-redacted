Subject: **China**'s dangerous test 
**Beijing** plans to give its 22 million residents behavioral report cards as **China** moves toward higher-
intensity monitoring of its entire population. This strategy, similar to those of other Chinese cities, 
has been made easier by mobile technology and existing state restrictions on electronic 
anonymity. Getting an "F" on this test doesn't mean staying after school, though. The 
consequences can last a lifetime. —David E. Rove/la
