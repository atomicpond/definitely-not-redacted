Here we are -> record highs for the S&P 500, the S&P 400 Midcaps, and small cap Russell **2000**. Should we be asking ourselves if 
this is the Terminal Phase or will this continue ? 
In these snippets here is a quick mark to market on where we are and some of the trades below. The theme of the trades below is very 
clear, carry outperformance and lower **Vol**. **Vol** has broken down and we are on the leg down to **2009** levels (includes FX **Vol**, rates 
**Vol**, commodity **Vol** etc) -> this has prompted additional risk taking and technicians for example are calling for 1775 levels in the S&P 
-> sharpe ratios of high carry trades looks very compelling here 
Mark to Market: 
With the US government reopened / debt ceiling raised, Obama stated -> there were "no winners." It's been only about 3 weeks, but 
the fourth quarter has already shown itself worthy of the history books. If the spec community can hold gains through **year-end** (the 
**Vol** markets are alluding to) -> the ranks of billionaires will surely inflate further. No winners, right ? 
**this **week**** saw the **S&P500**, the S&P 400 Mid-Cap Index and the small cap Russell **2000** all trade to record highs. The **week**'s 2.8% 
advance increased the small caps' year-to-date gain to 31.3%. **Google** added about 140 points and $38.5bn of market cap **this **week**** (to 
$338bn) to reach an all-time high (up 43% y-t-d). The more speculative "beta" stocks continue to outperform. The NASDAQ 100 (up 
3.7% **this **week****), Morgan Stanley High Tech Index (up 2.6%) and The Interactive **week** Internet Index (3.4%) all traded to the highest 
levels since **2000**. **Treasury**, **MBS**, and corporate debt prices were higher as well. It all adds up. 
The QE-enhanced **2013** version of "how crazy do things get?" is outshining even the **1999** speculative melee, yeah!!. The (post-
LTCM bailout) year **1999** saw the small cap Russell **2000** Index jump from 422 to 505 (19.7%). **this year**, it has already run from 849 
to 1,114 (up 31.3%). The S&P400 Midcap Index jumped from 392 to 445 in **1999** (13.5%). With more than two months to go, so far 
it's 1,020 to 1,290 for the midcaps (up 26.5%). 
Why stop just at the US. **Germany**'s DAX equities index added 1.6% **this **week**** to a new all-time high (up 16.5% y-t-d). Italian stocks 
jumped 2.1% (up 18.4% y-t-d) and Spanish stocks surged 3.5% (up 22.5%), both to more than two-year highs. Australian stocks 
gained 1.7% (up 14.5% y-t-d). Despite major economic issues, **India**'s stock market jumped 1.7% **this **week**** to within a couple percent 
of new highs. Stocks jumped 4.2% in **Brazil** and 4.3% in **Argentina**. Indonesian stocks rallied 4.5%. Around the globe, most equities 
markets pushed higher. Fueled by huge **ETF** flows, total equity mutual fund inflows this past **week** jumped to a whopping $12.7bn. 
You may want to see this -> On a **weekly** basis, global central bank International Reserve Assets (data from **Bloomberg**). This data 
provide a decent proxy for global financial flows, especially to the emerging markets (EM). From $6.63 TN back in April of **2009**,  
International Reserves surged **this **week**** to a record $11.415 TN. Reserves have inflated 330% in **ten years**. 
Lets focus on some trades here: 
1) This environment is supportive for carry trades, which has been reflected in the outperformance of high yielders following the 
announcement of the US debt deal. 
Long **AUD**/USD: Longer term investors remain relatively short **AUD**, which suggests that AUDUSD strength has further to run. A 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 022322 
move above parity is unlikely as the RBA should step in. Therefore buy 2m 0.9750 call against selling 2x 0.9900 calls. The AUDUSD 
risk reversal looks cheap (calls expensive relative to puts). This suggests selling high-strike calls, either outright for those that do not 
expect further **AUD** appreciation or to finance a low-strike call for a short-term carry position. 
Long KRW NDF : this trade will benefit should CNY appreciation or band widening expectations gain additional traction 
Long USD TRY: the market remains relatively short TRY, and with risk premium in USDTRY declining the most among major 
currencies, these short positions are likely to be at risk from carry traders. 
2) HY vs IG compression trade in **Europe**: **six weeks** of retail outflows from high-grade funds but retail inflows into high-yield funds 
shows that the compression trade in credit is firmly entrenched in **Europe**. There is a structu
