Subject: mission acomplished for some

**philanthropy** — Full text articles 
Revealed: the world's most admired people 
Stephan Shakespeare —**Times** 
**Bill **Gates**** is the most admired person in the world. 
according to a global survey for The **Times** by YouGov. The man who many 
see as responsible for the democratisation of computing and who is the biggest activist philanthropist across the globe is 
highly regarded everywhere. 
In his home, **America**, he ranks only 5th, behind **Pope **Francis****, **President Obama**, Billy Graham, and **George W. Bush**. Mr 
Obama and the Pope have a strong lead in Western nations but Mr **Gates** is highly regarded in every country polled, from 
**Brazil** to **Egypt**, **Nigeria** to **Indonesia**, **Britain** to **Russia** to **Australia**. He tops the poll in **China** — as respondents there said: "He 
got into a good university, but gave up studying to start his business. He has become a rich man despite dropping out of school 
... He has a successful career and a caring heart — he is ordinary, but great." 
The **Queen** came highest in **Britain** and second in **Australia**, but didn't make the Indian top ten. Nevertheless she is the most 
admired woman in the world, in 17th place, closely followed by Angelina Jolie and Oprah Winfrey. 
Half of the top ten admired in **Russia** are women, including the pop singer Alla Pugacheva and the **Queen**. That is the highest 
figure in all countries surveyed — women are strikingly under-represented. 
Some light is shed on this by comparing our results with a recent **Gallup** poll in **America**, which asked for most admired man 
and woman in separate questions. In that poll, Bill Clinton scored 2 per cent and **Hillary Clinton** 15. YouGov asked a single 
question, not differentiating men and women, and the two **Clintons** rated about the same. The two polls also show the power of 
the media to direct public attention: **Gallup** polled early in **December**, and **Pope **Francis**** was "most admired" by only 4 per cent. 
By the time of the YouGov survey, Time magazine had made him its Person of the Year, and he shot up to 21 per cent. 
Business leaders did well in general. YouGov puts Sir Richard Branson 4th in **Britain**, the **Hong Kong** billionaire Sir Li Kashing 
was sixth in **China**; the Nigerian industrialist Aliko Dangote was third in his home country; Silvio Santos, a media billionaire, 
was 4th in **Brazil**; Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the tycoon recently freed by **Vladimir Putin**, was 8th in **Russia**; while **Warren Buffett**, 
who is admired in **India**, **Pakistan** and **China**, was 8th in the world. 
Actors and musicians do less well. With the exception of the Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan, Ms Jolie and Stephen 
Fry, who confirms his enormous **Twitter** following by making 7th in **Britain**, just below Desmond Tutu. **Johnny Depp** and Brad 
Pitt get close to the top in a couple of countries and Justin Bieber did well in **Indonesia**, but the rock star and anti-poverty 
campaigner Bono is notable by his absence. 
Sportsmen were more highly regarded, with the Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar 5th in the world — but only because he is so 
adored in the world's second-most populous country. The footballer Lionel Messi had broader support, reaching 15th in the 
world. In **Britain**, **David Beckham** squeaked into 10th place. 
In only two countries of the 13 surveyed did no local politician make it into the top ten —**Australia** and the UK. The omission 
was most striking in **Britain** where **Nigel Farage**, the top politician, was in 16th place. **David Cameron** received the "most 
admired" accolade from only two people in a thousand. In **Germany**, **Angela Merkel** scored 65 **Times** higher at 13 per cent, 
second only to the Pope. **Vladimir Putin** topped the Russian poll with a whopping 24 per cent, **Nicolas Sarkozy** was third in 
**France** and Goodluck Jonathan 8th in **Nigeria**. Edward Snowden, responsible for leaking classified documents that revealed 
the extent of surveillance by **America**'s **National Security Agency**, was 10th most admired in the country that granted him 
asylum, **Russia**. He also showed strongly in **Germany**. We also asked who was the most famous person in the world. The 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 028529 
overwhelming choice was Mr Obama, with 26 per cent, and Mr **Gates** behind on 12. 
YouGov polled in ****Great **Britain******, **France**, **Germany**, **Russia**, the US, **Australia**, **Pakistan**, **Indonesia**, **India**, **China**, **Egypt**, **Nigeria** 
and **Brazil**, representing over half of the world's population and the most populated country on each continent, and spoke to 
total of 13,895 people around the world. We used a mix of internet and mobile phone surveys. In most countries we achieved 
representative samples but in some we were unable to achieve good representation of rural communities. Our survey asked 
two open-ended questions, seeking write-in answers: who do you think is the most famous person in the world, and who do 
you personally most admire? 
Although we specified that only living people
