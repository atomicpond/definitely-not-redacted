Is this a reasonable response? Should i even respond? Could use advice. 
Mutual decisions about meeting and everything else at the time. I assumed that was clear.

Dear Dr. Krauss, 
Apologies for the multiple emails. 
Regarding #1, you say it "refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 where we mutually 
decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and there were 
respectful and platonic encounters afterwards." 
To clarify, are you saying that this mutual decision was reached in the hotel room? Or was this discussed 
subsequently? 
Sincerely, 
Peter Aldhous

Dear Dr. Krauss, 
Thank you for your responses, which state that the allegations made against you are false and/or distorted. 
That does raise a question: 
Why do you think that multiple women, over **more than a decade**, have separately made accusations against 
you? 
Sincerely, 
Peter Aldhous

I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your email. I am currently on a plane until noon pacific time, and then 
heading to a meeting right after landing, till about 2 pm or so. While I am running the risk that you will report 
my comments, if you do, either out of context, or incompletely, I am responding with an effort to be complete, 
as I always try and do with reporters. If you decide to go ahead with a story, which, after reading my responses, 
I hope you decide is inappropriate, I would like you to quote my responses fully in order not to distort them. 
It is hard to know how to respond to a list of false and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading 
statements. I treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard to support and mentor students, 
colleagues, and members of the general public, and this is supported by the institutions of which I am a part. I 
do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your reporting is to somehow argue that Universities and other 
institutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, then in fact the situation is quite the 
opposite. My high public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also opens 
me up to a host of unfounded outside complaints and allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which 
**The University** has to respond to. The fact that I have remained a professor in all Universities with which I have 
been associated, in good standing, and also an officer or an invited speaker at organizations like CFI, which 
have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that their experience validates a trust in my 
behavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and continue to be invited to their last 3 meetings to 
speak, specifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally appreciated my 
talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the purpose of your report is to 
impugn my integrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of your 
'miscellaneous facts', as a scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than 
allegations and innuendo by people whose motives I cannot judge. I also try and judge the facts in context. The 
fact that Universities and other organizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is 
because they value my contributions and my actions. 
The items you list are false or distorted. Item 1 refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 where 
we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and there 
were respectful and platonic encounters afterwards. There is nothing to comment on in item 3, which involves 
an anonymous 3rd party claim because I know nothing about it, there are no details provided, and it clearly was 
not taken seriously enough to result in any university action. Item 4 i
