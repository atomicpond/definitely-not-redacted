Bryan Rafanelli
Biography
“If party planning is a fine art, then consider Bryan Rafanelli a virtuoso”
WCVB-TV **Boston**
“The event planner of **the year**”
Town & Country
Bryan Rafanelli’s exquisite sense of style, attention to detail and ability to transform clients’
visions into unforgettable celebrations have made him a go-to planner for the nation’s most
exclusive and high-profile events. He has produced it all, from elaborate fairytale-themed
fundraising galas for **Massachusetts General Hospital** for Children to Chelsea Clinton’s “wedding
of **the decade**” to State Dinners hosted by **President **Barack Obama**** and First Lady Michelle
Obama.
Rafanelli and his firm, Rafanelli Events, have a simple philosophy: every event is a unique
creative challenge deserving of a one-of-a-kind approach. “My team listens to what you’re
imagining and then comes back with an idea you never expected,” he says. “We hone in on
every last detail so we can always deliver clients the highest level of service.”
The media has taken notice. A recent feature in OUT magazine reads, “For a flawlessly executed
affair to remember, a behind-the-scenes mastermind juggles the details. If you’re lucky, that
person will be event planner Bryan Rafanelli.” And the headline of a recent ****New York** Times**
profile –For Wedding Planner, Obsession with Privacy– reinforces that Rafanelli is tight-lipped no
matter whom the client is, letting his work speak for itself.
Rafanelli has been named “Man of the Moment” by Town & Country (**2010**), a **2011** “Innovator”
and “Event Producer of **the year**” by BizBash, one of OUT magazine’s “100 Most Compelling
People in **2010**”, a “Trendsetter of **the year**” by Modern Bride, a “40 Under 40” by the **Boston**
Business Journal and “Best in **Boston**” **eight **years**** running by **Boston** magazine. His events have
been highlighted in: The **New York** Time
