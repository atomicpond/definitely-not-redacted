OPINION 
A Light of a Fierce Fire 
Yitzhak Rabin's bravery in office helped create peace between **Palestine** and **Israel**. 
By MORTIMER B. ZUCKERMAN I November 4, 2015 
Editor's note: This editorial originally appeared in the November 20, 1995 issue of U.S. News & World 
Report. 
The poet was once asked, "If your house was burning and you could save only one thing, what would you 
save?" The poet answered, "I would save the fire, for without the fire we are nothing." 
It was Yitzhak Rabin's destiny not to be saved from the frenzy of a madman. But bullets cannot so easily 
extinguish what Rabin's bravery and vision ignited, the fire of **Israel**'s commitment to peace. He might so 
easily have died in the din of battle, this man who made war when he had to. But he died instead amid the 
clamor of peace, with the acclaim of a mass peace rally of Israelis still in the air and still in his mind. It would 
be his last wish that the flame of peace, for which he gave his life, should not be dimmed by anger and 
despair. His **State** funeral, for all its sadness, was inspiring as an occasion for the vindication of his hopes, 
for a new dedication to **Israel**'s security from **America** and for a demonstration of goodwill by some former 
Arab enemies.

President Clinton led a bipartisan delegation that included the congressional Republican leadership, former 
**President Bush** and former Secretary of **State** George Shultz. It was more than a respectful gesture of 
protocol. This was a statement of emotional and psychological support from the most powerful nation in the 
world to a small, isolated country, living in a perilous neighborhood and in a time of great national trauma: 
We do more than share your grief, we understand your fears; we will not desert you as you have so many

times in your history been deserted. All Americans could take pride in President Clinton's splendid eulogy; 
in the uniqueness of **America**'s compassion and friendship that extended beyond a calculation of narrow 
national interest; in the honor of the hand outstretched at a time of need to an ally and friend. The president 
rose to the moment. The hundreds of thousands of people who lined the roadside and saw the American 
delegation were clearly moved. 
Of equal significance was the roll call of certain 
Arab countries (excluding ****Saudi Arabia****) and 
especially the emotional speech of King Hussein 
of **Jordan**. His words referring to Yitzhak and 
Leah Rabin as "my brother" and "my sister," 
which Muslims usually reserve for one another, 
and the tears shed by both the king and his 
queen, made a deep impression on the Israelis 
for their humanity and ability to overcome the 
past. Here, clearly, were keepers of Rabin's flame 
of peace, continuing a line that began with **Egypt**'s 
late president Anwar Sadat. 
It is hard for outsiders to appreciate the effect on 
Israelis of the worldwide outpouring of sympathy 
and condolence, with some 80 nations 
represented at the funeral. The Israelis are a traumatized people. They have for so long been alone, so 
long believed they could not rely on anyone but themselves, so long expected the world to stay silent in 
their times of trouble. The extensive response resonates for a people who remember how the world closed 
its doors to millions of Jews in **the 1930s**. Their deaths in the Holocaust were but an obscene multiple of the 
deaths endured in the crusades and pogroms of earlier centuries when the Jews were betrayed by those 
who had the power to save them. 
He alone, at the time, 
had the capacity to 
persuade the divided 
and wary Israelis to 
accept a compromise. 
**Israel** was to be the end of that vulnerable status of perpetual minority, an end to exile and alienation, and a 
beginning of a normal and natural form of national existence. **Israel** was home, the new home in the old 
country, proclaiming that the Jews had formed a self-reliant community and did not need others to fight 
their battles for them. Now they had their future defined by their own family; the farmer, the kibbutznik, the 
jet pilot, the shopkeeper, the schoolteacher could coalesce with a traditional language, with their own bible, 
their own culture. This self-reliance is a matter of great pride. Jews could look after their own family. When 
the Jews were kidnapped in Entebbe, **Uganda**, it was the Israelis who took
