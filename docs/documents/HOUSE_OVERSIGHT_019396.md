Economics 1545: International Financial and Macroeconomic Policy 
Professor Kenneth Rogoff 
Time and Place: Fall 2009; M, W, 1-2:30 pm., Sever Hall 203 
Office Hours: Littauer Center 216. Mondays 3-4 PM, or by appointment 
Email: (NB. When sending an email pertaining to this course, please put 
"1545" in the subject header.) 
Teaching Assistant: Thomas Sampson____________________________ 
Staff Assistant: Jane Trahan,__________________________________ 
Overview: 
This is an advanced international finance and macroeconomics course that uses a mix of 
theoretical, empirical and policy frameworks to analyze topical problems in international finance. 
Prerequisites: 
Economics 1011b (preferably) or 1010b (Knowledge of basic calculus will be assumed.) 
Background Texts: (On reserve at Lamont Library, and available for purchase at the COOP) 
• Foundations of International Macroeconomics, by Maurice Obstfeld and Kenneth Rogoff, MIT 
Press, 1996. 
• This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly, by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth 
Rogoff, ****Princeton University** Press**, 2009, (selected chapters). 
Readings: 
Readings can be accessed online or are available on Reserve at Lamont Library. 
Primary readings are denoted by an * symbol. Supplementary readings will be summarized in 
class but are not required. 
Problem Sets: 
Students are encouraged to work with others on the problem sets, and it is permissible to hand in a 
single answer sheet for up to three students, with all three receiving the same group grade. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 019396 
Course Requirements: 
• Midterm: Wednesday October 14 (in-class, closed book; but exam will provide most of the 
basic formulas you might require, to lessen need for memorization). Analytical problems 
on the exam will closely parallel material covered in problem sets (but will generally 
require much less algebra), and the essay problem will relate to a central topic covered 
extensively in class. 
• Final: The final will have a larger essay component than the mid-term. The final will draw 
on the entire course, though any technical material on the final will be closely related to 
material covered in Problem Set III. 
• Short policy paper: You will be asked to write a short policy paper on a topic drawn from 
a list of questions relating to reform of the international monetary system. A one-page 
outline of your paper is due on Wednesday, October 28 or before my first meeting with 
your group, whichever is earlier, and the complete paper is due on Monday **November** 16. 
These papers will form the basis for class discussions and (depending on class size) in-
class presentations during the final four meetings of the class. The papers are intended to 
be short and succinct—there is an absolute total page limit of 10 double-spaced (12 pt.) 
pages (roughly 2500 words): Only figures and references are excluded in this limit. The 
papers do not need to include any formal analytical or econometric analysis; you may 
write them in a style you find suitable to the question you are addressing. The final exam 
will include (a choice of) essay questions relating to the paper topics that you and your 
classmates have chosen. 
• Problems: There will be 3 problem sets, due Sept 14, Oct. 5 and Nov 16. 
Grades: 
Problems: 10%, Mid-term: 20%, Final: 35%, Paper: 35%
