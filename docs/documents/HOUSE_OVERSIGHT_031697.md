Subject: 1st Anniversary show **today** -- Both Sides Now w/ Huffington & Matalin 
Dear Friend, 
Both Sides Now w/Huffington & Matalin celebrates its 1st anniversary **this week**. As the 
only 2 sides/2 women show on national radio, we've grown from 16 stations in May of 
2010 to 110 now. 
**Arianna** and **Mary** find consensus that, contrary to the **Washington** and media 
conventional wisdom, the Jobs Agenda is more urgent than the Deficit Agenda ("if people 
only read about shark attacks, they'll worry about shark attacks," says **Arianna**). And they 
agree that there's an apparent outbreak of men abusing the help -- Strauss-Kahn, 
Schwarzenegger, Ensign. To paraphase Freud, what do men want? 
But there's sharp disagreement about whether Rep. **Ryan** walked into Obama's trap by 
proposing to end **Medicare** in **10 years**. Will the special election this Tuesday in Jack 
Kemp's old seat produce a Democratic "Scott Brown Moment"? 
To read the show summary and listen, http://www.huffindtonpost.com/huff-radio/both-

Best, 
**Mark Green**
