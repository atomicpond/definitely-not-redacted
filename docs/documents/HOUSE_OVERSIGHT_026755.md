Private Donor Helps Fund Scientists After **Trump**’s Proposed “Anti-Science” Budget Cuts

The famous **American Astrophysicist**, **Neil deGrasse Tyson**, once said,

“The good thing about science is that it’s true, whether or not you believe in it.”

**Neil deGrasse Tyson**’s quote from The Colbert Report distinguishes the difference between opinion and fact. Science, as a base, is always true. Yet, it is interpretation that imparts human error. In other words, while science is a universal truth, not everyone believes in the importance of science. 

Consider **President **Trump****’s **2018** budget request <https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/**2017**/05/22/**Trump**-budget-seeks-huge-cuts-to-disease-prevention-and-medical-research-departments/?utm_term=.90cee7bfb7ab> . Many of these call for massive cuts in spending on scientific research, medical research, disease prevention programs and more. If these requests are met, the National Cancer Institute would face a $1 billion cut compared to its **2017** budget. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute could see a $575 million cut, and the **National Institute** of Allergy and Infectious Diseases would see a reduction of $838 million. The administration would cut the overall **National Institutes** of Health budget from $31.8 billion to $26 billion.

**the National Science **Foundation****, which gives $7 billion a year in grants to universities and research institutes, is not specifically mentioned in the budget. However, unspecified “other agencies” are in line for a 9.8 percent budget cut.

Since **Trump** became president, the official ****White House**** website also deleted all mentions of climate from the site – all but one – the promise to eliminate the “harmful and unnecessary” Climate Action Plan. 

Following these actions, scientists and other employees of the **EPA** and **USDA** were told not to speak to the public about climate change or other scientific concerns that should be addressed. 

Private Donations To Fund Science

Due to **Trump**’s anti-science policies and budget cuts, scientists are looking towards private donors for funding. Philanthropic dollars have now come to play an important role in scientific progress.

The successful American financier and philanthropist, **Jeffery Epstein**, is well known for supporting science; he is currently taking action to help a number of scientists thrive during the “******Trump** Era****.” 

None of this is new for Jeffery, though. Jeffery’s funding for science dates back to **the year 2000**, when he founded the <https://www.jeffreyepstein.org/Jeffrey_Epstein.html> **Jeffery Epstein** VI **Foundation** <https://www.jeffreyepstein.org/Jeffrey_Epstein.html>  to support cutting-edge science and science education around the world. **The ****Jeffrey** Epstein** VI **Foundation**** has supported many leading scientists including Stephen Hawkings, Martin Nowak, Gregory Benford, Lee Smolin, Seth Lloyd, **Lawrence Krauss**, **Artificial Intelligence** scientist, Marvin Minsky and Nobel Laureates Gerard ‘t Hooft, David Gross and **Frank Wilczek**. 

In **2003**, the **Foundation** established the <https://ped.fas.harvard.edu/> Program for **Evolutionary Dynamics** <https://ped.fas.harvard.edu/>  at ****Harvard University****, providing a $35 million gift to the university. The program is one of the first to study the evolution of molecular biology with the primary use of mathematics. It also became one of the first departments to develop a mathematical model to show how cancer cells evolve as infectious bacteria and viruses such as HIV.

While **Jeffrey** has donated large sums of money to help find a cure for cancer and infectious diseases, **President **Trump****’s proposed budget seeks an $82 million cut for the center that works on vaccine-preventable and respiratory diseases, such as influenza and measles. 

**Trump**’s budget also proposes a cut of $186 million from programs at **CDC**’s center on HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections and tuberculosis prevention. One of the biggest cuts, however, is $222 million for the agency’s chronic disease prevention programs, which are designed to help people prevent diabetes, heart disease and stroke, and obesity.
