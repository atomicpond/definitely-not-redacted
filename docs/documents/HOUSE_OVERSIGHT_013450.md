L’Oscars
Winner Woody Allen may have missed Hollywood’s
biggest lovefest, but intrepid über movie publicist
**Peggy Siegal** was there for
every single party and every single
step of the red carpet way. This
year, her exclusive Oscar diary
chronicles close encounters with
Michelle Williams, **Meryl Streep**,
Harvey Weinstein, Nancy Reagan,
Elizabeth Olsen, George Clooney
and his French doppelganger
Jean Dujardin and, of course, Uggie.

N
avigating our presidential
campaign was a piece of cake
compared to understanding the
nuances of the 2011 Oscar race for the
most revered artistic honor in the world.
This is how nine films fell into the big
picture.
Three premiered in Cannes mid-May,
a distant nine months ago, creating an
Oscar campaign as long as any human
pregnancy. At the Palais, the first inkling
of Oscar buzz was born as the reclusive
Woody Allen premiered Midnight in
Paris. PBS later aired a documentary of
Woody discussing his forty-four films
showing the astonishing depth of his
talent that made you want to immediately
hand him the Oscar for **Best Picture**.
Academy rules and Woody forbade
marketing this gem.
Woody is not a member of the
Academy becase he doesn’t feel that films
should be in competition. He told me, “A
statue does not change your life. You still
get a cold. You can’t get a date. You still
have everyday things to worry about.”
The Academy learned to love him from
a distance and gave him Best Original
Screenplay as a consolation.
Terrence Malick’s long-awaited,
esoteric The Tree of Life was unveiled at
Cannes and won the coveted Palme D’Or,
positioning it for a nomination.
The Artist, created by the French, shot
in Hollywood and about Hollywood was
the festival surprise. This charming and
oddly original black-and-white silent
entry was introduced by the ringmaster
himself, Harvey Weinstein. No one
could pronounce or spell director Michel
Hazanavicius’s name. Jean Dujardin
could not speak a word of English and
neither could his **10-year-old** co-star, the
Jack Russell Uggie who had been rescued
from the pound after two adopters found
him too wild. Tragically Uggie developed
an undisclosed neurological disorder
during production, forcing him to retire
at the height of his popularity.
No slam dunk Oscar winner emerged in
Cannes. Any future film could easily win.
**DreamWorks**’ The Help premiered
in LA in August and distributor Disney
began propelling the politically correct and
socially significant film to box office heaven
of $200 million. **Viola Davis** and Octavia
Spencer were forecast to win Oscars.
In September, the Toronto and New
York Film Festivals and Fox Searchlight
presented Alexander Payne’s Hawaiian
family saga, The Descendants, which broke
out of the pack with whispers of winning.
Beloved George Clooney, playing a
father for the first time was hailed as a
shoo-in for best actor. Directing Ides of
March added momentum.
Also at New York’s festival Marty
Scorsese and Paramount sneaked an
unfinished cut of Hugo in Alice Tully
Hall, built for concerts but converted into
a 3-D theater. Marty was christened the
visionary genius of an innovative, costly
3-D masterpiece.
Director **Bennett Miller**’s highly
anticipated Moneyball for Sony hit a
grand slam at its west coast premiere in
58 | AVENUE MAGAZINE • APRIL 2012
Oakland putting the film, its heart throb star
Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill and seasoned writers
Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin in play.
Spielberg’s epic War Horse for **DreamWorks**
came thundering down the pike with a huge
premiere back at Alice Tully Hall, with
posters of Lincoln Center’s Tony winning
theatrical version and their indelible puppets
in the background. Steven paid homage to
legends John Ford and David Lean and the
country fell in love with a horse named Joey
and his 14 stand-ins.
Studios worked their stars to the bone.
Ironically, Harvey Weinstein’s independent
French talent who lived in Paris were not
as available as their competitors, therefore
Uggie became a superstar igniting a pet war.
Christopher Plummer, who had Best
Supporting Actor in the bag promoted his
Jack Russell, Cosmo. Diminutive Scorsese
was seen on TV on a small couch with his
large Doberman, Blackie, drooling on his
suit. Spielberg never got a chance to trot
out his lead horse Joey, previously seen in
Seabiscuit because his ravishing reddish coat
was now darkened for another role.
By December, as film critics bestowed
their own awards upon many films, Stephen
Daldry struggled to finish Extremely Loud
and Incredibly Close with a new score. There
was buzz Daldry could be editing the winner.
Producer Scott Rudin juggled his astounding
three films in one year from Daldry, Miller
and David Fincher directing Girl with the
Dragon Tattoo.
Daldry has received three consecutive
directing nomina
