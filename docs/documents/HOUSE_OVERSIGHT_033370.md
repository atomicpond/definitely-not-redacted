Subject: Re: B727 deal 
Importance: High 
I spoke to my **FAA** in **Orlando**, it will take the buyer **6 months** to obtain a FAR125 certificate if we do not include ours, 
**Darren** and Rich are working on possibility of including JEGE, INC with sale of **Boeing**, this will be valuable to buyer and 
prove to be beneficial monetarily to you if we can include the company name in the sale. **FAA** informs me its taken 
under into consideration on a case by case basis if they will approve another buyer to operate my FAR125 certificate. My 
**FAA** inspector did mention that Trump did the same deal when he purchased his B757, it included the manuals and 
company.

Jeffrey, 
I spoke to Gary and he agrees to make a counter offer, do you agree with the following: 
-Counter the offer at $2.750M 
-deal to include my FAR125 certificate, along with the company name: JEGE, Inc. this provides the buyer with ease of 
transition and keeps the B727 on its current FAR125, tremendous value to buyer,. 
-Buyer understands purchase is "As Is" but has the opportunity to visually inspect the aircraft in Palm Bch along with my 
records. 
-closing to be on December 30th 2013. 
-Buyer will pay round trip repositioning expense Brunswick GA to Palm Beach and return to Brunswick if buyer declines 
the aircraft (fuel cost round trip $14,930.00). 
-Seller will deduct the reposition expense if buyer proceeds with purchase. (fuel expense to fly B727 to Palm Beach is 
$7,465.00). 
is this approved? 
thank you, 
Larry
