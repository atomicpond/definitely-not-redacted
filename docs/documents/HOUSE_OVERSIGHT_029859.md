Ending years of speculation about how much **Palm Beach** billionaire **Jeffrey **Epstein****  
paid young women who claimed he used them as sex toys, court documents filed last 
week show he shelled out $5.5 million to settle lawsuits with three of more than two 
dozen teens who sued him. 
Responding to requests from **Epstein**'s attorneys in a complex lawsuit that was 
spawned by the sex scandal, attorney **Bradley **Edwards**** said the politically-
connected 64-year-old convicted sex offender paid more than $1 million to each of 
the three women **Edwards** represented. 
Identified in court papers only by their initials or pseudonyms because of the nature 
of the allegations and their youthful ages, L.M. was paid $1 million, E.W. $2 million 
and **Jane Doe** $2.5 million, **Edwards** said of the settlements he negotiated with 
**Epstein** to end the lawsuits. 
**Jack Goldberger**, one of **Epstein**'s criminal defense attorneys, on **Tuesday** declined 
comment on the revelations, citing confidentiality agreements that were part of the 
settlements. For the same reason, he declined to say whether **Epstein** paid similar 
amounts to settle roughly two dozen lawsuits filed by other young women against 
**Epstein**, claiming he paid them for sex when some were as young as **14 years old**. 
Attorney **Jack **Scarola****, who is representing **Edwards**, said his client was compelled 
to divulge the confidential settlements to answer questions posed by **Epstein**'s 
attorneys. "Brilliant move on their part," he said.

Even if **Epstein**'s attorneys hadn't opened the door, **Scarola** said the information 
would have likely come out. He says the information will help him undermine 
**Epstein**'s claims that **Edwards** "ginned up" the allegations to help his former law 
partner, imprisoned and disbarred ****Fort Lauderdale**** lawyer Scott **Rothstein**, 
perpetuate a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme. 
The revelations of the settlements came as part of an ongoing lawsuit that started as 
a dispute between **Epstein** and **Rothstein**, both billionaires. 
**a year** after **Epstein** in 2008 pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and 
procuring a minor for prostitution, he sued **Rothstein** and **Edwards**, claiming they 
trumped up the allegations of sexual molestation to perpetuate the Ponzi scheme. 
**Rothstein** was sentenced to **50 years** in prison in 2010 after admitting he had built 
his wildly successful law firm by forging the names of federal judges and others to 
persuade investors he had negotiated settlements in lawsuits against high-profile 
people. Investors were told they could get a cut of the cash. 
One of the high-profile people **Rothstein** used to lure investors was **Epstein**, 
according to a lawsuit ****West **Palm Beach****** attorney Robert Critton filed on **Epstein**'s 
behalf. According to the lawsuit, **Rothstein** told investors **Epstein**, a money 
manager, had agreed to settle the lawsuits with the teens for 8200 million — a claim 
Critton described as "a complete fabrication." 
After **Epstein** dropped the lawsuit in 2012, **Edwards** turned the tables on him. 
**Edwards** accused **Epstein** of filing the lawsuit maliciously to punish him for 
representing the young women. Although **Edwards** was a partner in **Rothstein**'s now 
defunct firm, **Scarola** claims **Epstein** had no evidence **Edwards** was involved in the 
Ponzi scheme. Federal prosecutors successfully charged other attorneys and 
members of the firm, but **Edwards** was never implicated, **Scarola** said in the 
malicious prosecution
