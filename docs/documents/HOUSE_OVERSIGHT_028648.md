take-it-or-leave-it deal by the U.S. on the 
nuclear issue is the wrong strategy  
Ray Takeyh 
February 14, 2013 -- On Feb. 26, **the United States** and Iran will once 
more resume their diplomatic ritual, in the so-called six-party talks, over 
Iran's disputed nuclear program. As the two perennial adversaries eye one 
another, there are competing paradigms about how to deal with Tehran. 
An emerging school of thought suggests that the best means of "testing" 
Iran is to offer it a final nuclear agreement that presumably promises 
measurable relief from sanctions for significant Iranian concessions. Iran's 
failure to grasp such an offer would then conclusively demonstrate to both 
domestic and international audiences that the cause of the impasse is not 
American belligerence but Iranian truculence. 
But this approach fails to recognize that an arms-control process is 
necessarily an incremental one, nor does it offer a practical substitute to 
the existing step-by-step diplomacy. 
Iran's nuclear program encompasses a vast complex of enrichment 
facilities, centrifuge construction plants, uranium extraction companies 
and thousands of scientists working in university and government 
laboratories. Iran is enriching uranium at both 5% and 20% levels, 
experimenting with high-velocity centrifuges and seemingly in the process 
of constructing additional enrichment facilities. 
Such a multilayered, multifaceted program can be dealt with only on a 
piecemeal basis, as the technical details and rules for inspections are too 
complex to be addressed in a single agreement. 
Moreover, should **the United States** offer Iran a final deal, Tehran still has 
a right to contest and negotiate its provisions and offer counterproposals. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028648 
The international community is unlikely to concede to either more 
sanctions or the use of force until Iran's objections are taken into full 
consideration. As such, a grand deal that is supposed to provoke a moment 
of clarity is likely to be enmeshed in the existing, protracted arms-control 
process. 
Another complication is the advent of public opinion and critical 
constituencies in Iran devoted to the perpetuation of the program. The 
growing public sentiment is that Iran has a right to acquire a nuclear 
capability. As the program matures, it is becoming a source of pride for a 
citizenry accustomed to the revolution's setbacks and failures. 
Also emerging is a bureaucratic and scientific establishment with its own 
parochial considerations for sustaining the nuclear investment. A clerical 
leadership that is dealing with a restive population and empowered 
security services cannot easily dispense with its nuclear trump card. 
All this suggests that the best means of addressing Iran's nuclear challenge 
is to mitigate its most dangerous dimensions. The focus should remain on 
Iran's high-grade enrichment and its underground nuclear facility nestled 
in mountains outside Qom. Tehran seems to have conceived an ingenious 
path to nuclear advancement, one that involves increasing the size and 
sophistication of its civilian atomic apparatus to the point where it can 
quickly surge into a bomb. While staying within the rules of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency's inspection process, Iran is 
essentially expanding its capabilities while shielding them under the 
veneer of legality. Given the fact that much of civilian nuclear technology 
can easily be misappropriated for military purposes, Iran can construct an 
elaborate nuclear infrastructure while remaining within IAEA guidelines. 
The diplomatic challenge is to derail this path to a nuclear weapon by 
imposing significant restraints on its program. And this can still be done 
through a process that proceeds incrementally and sequentially. 
U.S. officials would be wise to get out of the crisis mode and put some 
time back on the clock. The Iran issue always seems urgent, and yet 
somehow there is always time to deal with it. Washington should 
acknowledge the obvious, namely, that given Iran's gradualist approach, it 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028649 
is still years from completing an efficient enrichment infrastructure, 
constructing a nuclear arsenal and developing a reliable means of delivery. 
By agreeing to a compressed timeline, the U.S. only narrows its options 
and makes a solution even more elusive. 
As **the United States** again contemplates its Iran conundrum, it should 
eschew calls for a take-it-or-leave-it deal. The history of Iran's 
confrontation with the international community suggests that keeping it a 
crisis situation benefits **the **Islamic Republic****. Ironically, it is the Western 
powers that have generated alarmist conditions. And then to escape the 
predicament of their own making, they offer Iran more concessions and 
further incentives. 
To avoid a repeat of that outcome, it would be prudent to have a sense of
