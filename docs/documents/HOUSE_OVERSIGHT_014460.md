﻿European Equity Strategy
2017 year ahead – Refining the reflation
rotation
01 December 2016
Unauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited. This report is intended for amanda.ens@baml.com
Key takeaways
• 2017 - Reflation, Reversal, Rotation, Relief or Revolt. EPS to turn +ve but politics to
remain a valuation overhang in H1.
• Defensive vs Cyclical rotation at extreme levels. More balanced approach needed but
look for another leg to cyclical trades.
• O/w Media as quality cyclical and Oil. Stay cautious on UK domestic (Retail, Travel).
Health, Utilities over Food & Bev.
2017 – A year of cross currents, nimble investors required
Recovery (positive but moderate in our view) and Rotation go hand in hand - we think
that the pace of the rotation has to moderate. ECB reversal on QE is a risk and tapering
because the ability or willingness to do QE fades would likely cause a setback. Investors
will demand a premium for political risk until we get clarity on populist Revolt or policy
Relief in France and elsewhere. Like 2016 investors will need to trade the ranges.
High single digit upside - politics likely to weigh near term
A valuation overhang remains in Europe vs other DM. We see a return to positive EPS
growth (+7%) in Europe for the first time since 2014, driven by higher global GDP
growth Resources recovery, capex discipline and FX. +7% growth implies less
downgrades than usual (10% is the average). Base case upside in high single digits (c9%
total return) but politics may mean market highs are more likely achieved in H2.
Modestly higher yields and higher equities compatible
Equities can continue to perform with rising rates – the key is that inflation breakevens
are not falling. However, a more aggressive bond sell-off taking Treasury yields to 3% or
higher would undermine EM, the growth outlook, peripheral spreads and risky assets.
Reflation rotation stretched – refining our approach
Rotation has been extreme (>6SD move in Def vs Cyclicals). Argues for a moderation in
returns and a more balanced approach to sector allocation. Look for another leg to
cyclical trades in the New Year. Sector valuations have also moved a long way already.
Cautious on domestic UK exposure – Brexit still to bite
The full impact of sterling weakness on the UK consumer environment is yet to be felt
and Brexit negotiations are likely to drive further uncertainty and FX volatility. Structural
issues add to our concerns in Retail and Travel & Leisure (both underweight).
O/w Oil, Health, Utilities, Media; u/w Food & Beverage
An OPEC cut and higher oil would make Oil’s high DY sustainable. Healthcare is too
cheap vs an improving sector growth outlook and 2017 is a key year for pipeline news.
Food & Beverage still seems the least attractive Defensive on valuation, positioning. We
move overweight Media, a quality cyclical that has lagged and seen valuations de-rate.

Refining the reflation rotation
2017 is likely to have a number of cross currents as themes. Recovery (we look a
modest acceleration in both growth and inflation) and Rotation go hand in hand. On the
basis of our central forecasts for growth, inflation and rates and given the moves in the
market already we think that the pace of the rotation has to moderate. (In-line with that
we recently downgraded of banks and miners).
Reversal refers to the ECB. Our economists are not yet convinced that the ECB will
start to unwind loose policy 2017 but the probability is increasing. An ECB that tapers
because growth and inflation are improving would be supportive for markets, notably
banks. But tapering because the ability or willingness to do QE fades would likely cause
a setback. Relief or Revolt relates to European politics. Will Europe follow the route to
populism (revolt from the voters) or will we find relief for the markets by the end of
2017 from a Fillon/Merkel duo being in charge of the Euro area’s two largest
economies. We think investors will dem
