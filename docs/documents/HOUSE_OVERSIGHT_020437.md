Will Cohen Cooperate? Tenuous Finances May Provide Crucial Clues 
2018-04-27 08:00:00.2 GMT 
By Shahien Nasiripour and Caleb Melby 
(**Bloomberg**) -- In the two weeks since federal agents seized 
the files of **Michael Cohen**, President Donald **Trump**'s personal 
attorney and fixer, a question has hovered: Will Cohen cooperate 
with investigators? 
His decision could depend in part on whether he can readily 
shoulder the enormous legal fees required to fight a federal 
probe of this magnitude. 
At first blush, Cohen looks like a pretty rich man. He 
drives a white Rolls Royce, sports a $50,000 watch and owns a 
fair amount of **Manhattan** real estate. 
But just as his loyalty to **Trump** is coming under scrutiny, 
a more tenuous financial picture is emerging. A taxi business he 
and his wife built is deeply in debt and losing money **daily**, his 
commercial real estate is throwing off only modest income, and 
his legal and consulting work is on hold while he remains under 
investigation. 
Cohen declined repeated requests to comment. 
The owners of 32 **New York City** taxi licenses -- known as 
medallions -- he and his wife, Laura, took out at least 16 loans 
based on their once-soaring value, liens show. With the rise of 
Uber and Lyft, the price of a medallion has fallen from more 
than $1 million to around $163,000 in **the past four years**. 
Income from the taxi business has plummeted, and millions of 
dollars of the Cohens' loans went under water. Their bank said 
in a **November** public filing that it had loans out to three taxi 
borrowers, and all were at high risk of default. 
Suspended Medallions 
Unpaid taxes and fines have piled up at the Cohen taxi 
companies, triggering a suspension of about half of the 
medallions, city records show, squeezing cash flow. 
Whatever **monthly** income the cabs once produced almost 
certainly fell well short of the debt payments owed to Sterling 
National Bank, their Montebello, New York-based lender. Sterling 
has foreclosed on operators in similar situations and sued them 
but appears to be taking a less-confrontational approach with 
the Cohens. On **Tuesday**, the bank agreed to new loans for their 
companies and to Cohen personally, public filings show. Sterling 
declined to comment. 
The taxi business isn't the only part of Cohen's empire 
that's suffering. The law firm Squire Patton Boggs said it ended 
its "strategic alliance" with Cohen after law enforcement raided 
his offices, and the rest of his legal work could decline for 
the same reason. Cohen, 51, makes others' ugly problems 
disappear, a practice that was previously lucrative. Essential 
Consultants LLC, a company affiliated with Cohen, was paid 
$250,000 after he negotiated a $1.6 million payment to a former 
Playboy model on behalf of Republican National Committee 
official Elliott Broidy, according to a **Wall Street Journal** 
report. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 020437 
**Sean Hannity** 
Cohen has said in court that he had only three legal 
clients during **the past year**: Broidy, **Trump** and talk-show host 
**Sean Hannity**. He gave seven others "strategic advice and 
business consulting." 
**last month** Cohen said he borrowed from his home-equity 
credit line to make a $130,000 payment in **October 2016** to Stormy 
Daniels, an adult-film star who says she had sex with **Trump**. 
In a **Thursday** morning appearance on "Fox & Friends," **Trump** 
distanced himself from Cohen, saying he did only "a tiny, tiny 
little fraction" of **Trump**'s legal work, but it included 
representation "on this crazy Stormy Daniels deal." 
Russian Interference 
Cohen is under investigation for bank fraud and violating 
campaign-finance law. But his decade at **Trump**'s side as his 
lawyer and enforcer could yield information he might trade to 
investigators looking into the **Trump** campaign and **Russia**'s 
interference in the U.S. election. 
Still, if he chooses to defend himself, Cohen does have 
assets. Companies he signs for own two investment properties 
purchased in **2015**. The larger one, with 92 units on **New York's** 
**Upper East Side**, is 38 percent owned by Cohen's companies. The 
businesses also appear to be the sole owner of a downtown 
building with 20 units. 
Together they likely generate less than $1 million in 
**annual** net income for Cohen's companies after accounting for 
partner interests, expenses and financing costs, data compiled 
by **Bloomberg** show. Debt against the buildings is low, meaning 
that Cohen could tap them for cash. **last October**, the Cohens 
sold a unit at **Trump** World Tower, near the United Nations, for 
$3.3 million. 
Cohen has been a savvy property investor. He previously 
owned four buildings in need of repairs in Lower **Manhattan**, 
rehabilitated them and sold them for $32 million in **2014**, more 
than doubling his initial invest
