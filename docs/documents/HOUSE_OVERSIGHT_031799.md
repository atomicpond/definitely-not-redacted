The allegation: Harth claimed that **Trump** made repeated unwanted sexual advances as she and her romantic 
partner at the time, **George** Houraney, pursued a business relationship with the mogul in **the early 1990s**. She 
said that on January 24, 1993, at Mar-a-Lago, **Trump** offered her a tour of the estate, then pulled her into his 
daughter **ivanka**'s empty bedroom. 
"He pushed me up against the wall, and had his hands all over me and tried to get up my dress again," Harth 
said, "and I had to physically say: 'What are you doing? Stop it.' It was a shocking thing to have him do this 
because he knew I was with **George**, he knew they were in the next room. And how could he be doing this when 
I'm there for business?" 
In **1997** Harth and Houraney sued **Trump** for breach of contract, and she filed a separate sexual-harassment suit, 
accusing him of "attempted rape." They reached a confidential settlement in the contract suit, and as part of the 
agreement Harth withdrew her suit.
