﻿PRESERVING MONGOLIAN SOVEREIGNTY AND CULTURE
MONDAY, JUNE 19, 2017
The sovereignty of **Mongolia** is under siege.
The People’s Republic **China** (PRC) regards **Mongolia** as its “**Ukraine**” i , ii . Covertly the PRC has
ambitions not simply to make **Mongolia** a client or puppet state, as it was under Soviet domination,
but to integrate it with the PRC through a “voluntary” referendum, just as the Russians engineered
the assimilation of **Crimea** in **2014**.
This was **Mao** Tse-tung’s prophecy and intent once **China** could establish parity or surpass Soviet
military and economic might. iii
As the world’s attention is focused on **China**’s **South **China** Sea** claims, an asymmetrical war is also
being conducted by the PRC to achieve Mongolian assimilation. Russian influence is being
marginalized, as are **Mongolia**’s ‘3 rd Neighbor’ partners such as **Japan**, **South Korea**, **Germany**, and
the US iv . **China**’s penetration and Sinification of **Mongolia**’s natural resources, financial system,
businesses, infrastructure, media, social media, culture, religion, security, electoral system, and
political body are each battle fronts in a multi-pronged asymmetrical campaign to isolate and then
assimilate **Mongolia** v .
Preserving Mongolian sovereignty demands a global awareness of the PRC’s covert intent. An
education campaign is needed both within **Mongolia** and globally to counter a) the PRC’s revisionist
historical justification for claiming **Mongolia** as their **Crimea** vi and b) the PRC’s effort to isolate
**Mongolia** and control all aspects of **Mongolia**’s economy, resources, politics, and culture.
Without a counter-campaign **Mongolia** will in a decade’s time be assimilate and Sinicized like Inner
**Mongolia** and Manchuria vii . Mongolians will become strangers in their own land.
**China**’s assimilation of **Mongolia** will not only be a tragedy for the Mongolian people and the hope
for Central Asian democracy, but a threat to the balance of power in Eurasia.
i In negotiations in **1956** between the Soviets and the PRC, the Soviet negotiator, Sergo Mikoyan, and **CCP**
**Politburo** member Liu Shaoqi and Premier **Zhou Enlai**, the Chinese hoped to connect the granting of **Mongolia**
independence with the question of **stalin**’s “mistakes.” The Chinese requested the Soviets cancel **Mongolia**
independence in the wake of Khrushchev’s condemnation of **stalin**’s personality cult. Liu Shaoqi drew a
parallel between **Mongolia** and **Ukraine**. He declared that **Mongolia** was **China**’s “**Ukraine**”. Source: “New

ii In 26 **February 1989** **Deng Xiaoping** in a revealing complaint to **President **Bush**** showed enduring Chinese
views on **Mongolia** in regard to how **stalin** had stolen or severed **Mongolia** from **China**. “Memorandum of
Conversation between George H. W. **Bush** and Chairman **Deng Xiaoping** in **Beijing**”, Wilson Center, February
26, 1989,

iii On 2 September 1964 during **Mao**’s talk with the Japanese group of socialists, **Mao** announced that much of
Siberia and **Far East** once belonged to **China**: “About a hundred years ago the area of to the east of Baikal
become the territory of **Russia** and from then on Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, Kamchatka and other points are
the territory of **the **Soviet Union****. We have not yet requested settling this account!” The publisher of the
article writes that **Mao** makes this claim based on “the fact that many hundreds of years ago Chinese troops
came to these areas and that once the Chinese Emperor collected tribute from the local people. Sournce: “In

effort was, ironically, financed by the Imperial Japanese Army.
