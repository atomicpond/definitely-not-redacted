Subject: Re: 
Salvator Mundi, the last known da Vinci painting in private hands, has an incredible 
provenance. **Rybolovlev** purchased it for $127 million in **2013** through his art dealer, the 
Swiss businessman Yves Bouvier. Bouvier, the owner and operator of several freeports, 
bought the painting for $80 million with the intention of selling it to **Rybolovlev** at a steep 
profit. Its owner before Bouvier, the **New York City**-based gallerist Robert Simon, found 
the painting at an estate auction in **New Orleans** in **2005**. He paid just $10,000.
