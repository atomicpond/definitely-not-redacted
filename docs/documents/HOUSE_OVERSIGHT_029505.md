****Middle Eastern**** Monarchs Look at the 
Trumps and See Themselves 
**America**'s Arab allies have always wanted to buy direct access 
to U.S. foreign policy, and they finally found a seller.

Almost 20 years ago when I was a graduate student living in Cairo, I published an article in 
a **Washington**-based journal called ****Middle East**** Insight. The magazine had a solid 
reputation, with a knack for scoring interviews with important people. (In the same edition 
as my piece, titled "Egypt's Next Generation," there was an interview with Gamal Mubarak, 
son of long-term Egyptian President **Hosni Mubarak**, who had already begun his rise___ 
though not yet his eventual fall____as heir apparent.) **A few years later**, ****Middle East**** Insight 
disappeared. When I heard the news, I figured the magazine was too niche for an expanding 
media environment, shrugged my shoulders, and went on with life. 
I hadn't thought about ****Middle East**** Insight until its onetime publisher, George Nader, 
recently exploded into the news as an international man of mystery at the center of an 
apparent attempt to covertly influence the outcome of the last American presidential 
election. It seems that in the span of not quite **two decades**, the guy who ran a small, likely 
not profitable, but influential policy magazine become a conduit between Crown Prince 
Mohammed bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan of the ****Abu Dhabi****, Saudi Crown Prince 
Mohammed bin Salman, and **Donald Trump's** closest inner circle, both after, and 
crucially for special counsel ****Robert **Mueller****'s** ongoing criminal investigation___before 
Trump's election as U.S. president.

Nader's story is yet another example of the sleaze, greed, and influence-peddling that has 
come to seem ordinary in Trump-era **Washington**. But it also offers a view into a more 
extraordinary and unprecedented problem: a decision by some of **America**'s closest allies in 
**the ****Middle East****** to leverage their financial resources in common cause with a bunch 
of ganef s to influence U.S. foreign policy. It is a problem that can be traced back, in ways 
that haven't generally been understood, to Trump's son-in-law and senior advisor Jared 
Kushner and his mobile phone. 
From the perspective of the leaders of ****Saudi Arabia****, **the **United Arab Emirates****, Israel (there 
is an Israeli angle to the George Nader story, but it isn't yet entirely clear), and Egypt, there 
was an entirely rational reason to support Trump's presidential bid and try to influence his 
approach to **the ****Middle East******: They did not like former **President Barack Obama**'s Middle 
East policy. And while they likely understood that presidential nominee **Hillary Clinton** was 
more hawkish that the president she served as secretary of state, the Saudis, Emiratis, and 
Israelis were concerned that she would be tethered to the Iran nuclear deal and thus Obama's 
Iran policy. 
They also believed that Clinton would be soft on Islamists. It is an article of faith in Egypt 
that she enabled the rise of **the **Muslim Brotherhood**** and Mohamed Morsi in 2011 and 2012. 
For countries in **the **Persian Gulf****, Egypt provides strategic depth, and "losing" it to the 
**Muslim Brotherhood** was a major geopolitical blow. The Israelis, for obvious reasons, were 
deeply concerned about the accumulation of Islamist political power next door and blamed 
the Obama administration for abandoning **Hosni Mubarak**, thereby placing Israel's security 
in jeopardy. 
With Trump, **Washington**'s allies got a candidate and president who referred to the Iran 
nuclear agreement as the "worst deal ever," surrounded himself with people who either 
make no distinction between al Qaeda and **the **Muslim Brotherhood**** or are simply outright 
Islamophobes, and has forthrightly declared that **the United States** supports its friends in the 
fight against terrorism. Full stop. No caveats, buts, or howevers concerning human rights 
and the need for political reform. To them, this seemed a lot better than the appreciation of 
nuance and complexity that was a hallmark of the Obama administration. 
Of course, even if an American president shares a given ally's view of the world, diplomacy 
does not stop. The job of ambassadors, foreign ministers, and other representatives of 
foreign governments is to keep **the United States** on their side. Traditionally, this is done 
through formal discussions with U.S. officials at **the State Department**, National Security 
Council, and Department of Defense; meetings with members of **Congress**; writing op-eds in 
influential media outl
