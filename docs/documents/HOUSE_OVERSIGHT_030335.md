Swiss Accounts Survey 
Dear Mr **Epstein**, 
We are writing because a US media organisation, in concert with ourselves at the **Guardian** newspaper in 
**London**, is currently conducting a detailed survey of Swiss bank accounts, past and present. 
It is not illegal to have Swiss accounts. But as you may know, it is a topic of considerable public debate, and 
several governments have been investigating the owners of such accounts. 
There are a number of ways such accounts and also offshore trusts have been used to avoid inheritance tax, UK 
domestic tax, or tax imposed by other countries. Such accounts have also been used to launder money. 
We have seen records held in the US identifying you among those who have held accounts. These accounts 
contained assets of up to USD 3.5m, and include: 
**HSBC** (**Suisse**) SA 
FAMILY INTEREST L.P. 
22079 
BESSIE 
**Jeffrey **Epstein**** 
1) You may therefore have been a person evading or avoiding tax, or laundering money. 
We will be particularly concerned with these questions: 
2) Why you had Swiss accounts. 
3) How much back tax you have settled with the tax authorities following their investigation of your affairs. 
Additionally, from public records and from material we have seen we note that: 
4) In **2008** you pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and procuring minors for prostitution. You were 
sentenced to **18 months** in prison. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 030336 
5) Your above accounts were also linked with Mr **Leslie Wexner**. 
6) You are known to be or have previously been closely associated with Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and 
**Kevin Spacey**. 
7) You have made substantial contributions to the **Clintons**' philanthropic causes. Tax reform campaigners 
have previously been critical of those who engage in public life or the political process while avoiding or 
evading tax. **Hilary Clinton** herself, speaking in **2012**, noted the importance of elites paying a substantial share 
of tax: "One of the issues that I have been preaching about around the world is collecting taxes in an equitable 
manner — especially from the elites in every country." 
It is intended shortly to publish the results of our survey in both the US and the UK. 
As responsible journalists acting in the public interest, we would first like to give you the opportunity to 
comment. 
If we do not hear from you by 18:00 on **Monday 12th January 2015** (preferably by email to 
we shall proceed on the basis that you do not wish to comment on or amend 
our information. 
But we have approached you in a straightforward fashion and hope you will take this opportunity to respond if 
you wish. Your substantive responses to each of our numbered points will be carefully considered and 
published if appropriate. 
(For the avoidance of doubt, we do not normally regard any generalised assertion of "inaccuracies" as a 
substantive response; nor any generalised statement that the holders acted on advice. Neither will we regard as 
substantive any comment that only refers to the present state of affairs and not to the past.) 
We are, of course, happy to discuss directly any concerns you may hav
