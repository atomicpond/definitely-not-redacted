Thanks.. I need to get this or something to them quickly. I do feel the need to respond to each of their claims 
otherwise they would say I don't deny them.. Will include a short preamble. I am going to cc the letter to the 
Buzzfeed lawyers. I figure I will see whether the buzzfeed story gets any traction at all, or appears before 
putting on my web site, or tweeting and facebooking it.

normaly thier strategy will be to take back your defense to the accusers. and attack each one. if they find you 
are right they will leave out. and only go with the conflicted. I think you should include short concise cover 
letter. that you would like published in it entirety. it can refence your attacjment that you will put on your web 
site? . that goes into more details but in general , these are false. they were either investigated and found 
lacking or ignored. etc. often they throw out the near publishing date merely to get you to ansser.

I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your email. While I am running the risk that you will report my comments, if you do, either 
out of context, or incompletely, I am responding with an effort to be complete. It is hard to know how to respond to a list of false 
and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading statements on your part. I treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021416 
to support and mentor students, colleagues, and members of the general public. I do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of 
your reporting is to somehow argue that Universities and other institutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, 
then in fact the situation is quite the opposite. My high public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it 
also opens me up to a host of outside complaints and allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which **The University** has to 
respond to. The fact that I have remained a professor in all Universities with which I have been associated, in good standing, and also 
an officer or an invited speaker at organizations like CFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that they 
trust my behavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and invited to their last 3 meetings to speak, specifically because, as 
they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally appreciated my talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time 
with the attendees. If the purpose of your report is to impugn my integrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is 
false. As noted in one of your 'miscellaneous facts', as a scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather 
than allegations and innuendo. I also try and judge the facts in context. The fact that Universities and other organizations employ me 
or have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is because they value my contributions and my actions. 
The items you list are false or distorted. Item 1 refers falsely and inaccurately to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 
where we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and there were respectful 
and platonic encounters afterwards. There is nothing to comment on in item 3, which involves an anonymous 3rd party claim 
because I know nothing about it, there are no details provided, and it clearly was not taken seriously enough to result in any university 
action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because I decided I didn't want to go out to a bar with a group of attendees that I was 
harassing them? The second part did not happen. Re incident 5: The 'female companion' in this case is my wife, who can attest to 
the fact that the claim is false, which is what I wrote at the time in response to the blog in question, causing it to be taken down. 
It is worth responding to Item
