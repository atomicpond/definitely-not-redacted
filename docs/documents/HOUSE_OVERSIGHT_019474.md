Re: Ms. 
**Dear Sir** or Madam: 
Immigration Application 
I am writing this letter on behalf of Ms. and in 
connection with her 0-1 Visa Application. 
My name is David Blaine and I am a magician. I have performed my 
own brand of close up magic all over the world, and have also set and broken 
several world records, including holding my breath for over 17 minutes, 
spending 35 hours atop a 100-foot pole, surviving only on water for 44 days, and 
enduring **a week** buried in a coffin. I have traveled internationally, performing 
magic privately for President Bill Clinton and Secretary of **State** Hillary 
Clinton, President George W. Bush, Secretary of **Defense** Donald Rumsfeld at 
the **Pentagon**, Henry Kissinger, Bill Gates and Mayor **Michael Bloomberg**. 
I met Ms_____________________a few years ago through mutual friends 
and I was highly impressed with her. Aside from being an amazing fashion 
model, she has a strong passion for children and education. I realized what a 
talented public relations and fundraising expert she is when I saw her 
organizing numerous high end charitable events and organizations, as well as 
finding A-list funders for her causes. 
A fundraiser and public relations expert of extraordinary ability can 
find, target, and approach the correct people for their cause, and then recruit 
them with the correct individual enticements. This is a very difficult thing to 
pull off, but Svetlana was able to do so, not only with efficiency and success, 
but with great ease and grace, and she seems determined to keep going. The 
success stories she drew for the children of **the US Virgin Islands**, the Ivory 
Coast, and many others are incredible. She truly makes a difference in the 
lives of the world's children. 
That is a passion that we both share. **every year**, I travel all across the 
country and the world to perform magic for children's hospital wards, burn 
units, and juvenile prisons and detention centers. I also truly enjoyed 
performing magic for Paul Newman and groups of children at the Hole in the 
Wall Gang Camp, among other charitable causes. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 019474 
I've been discussing with how we can work together to raise 
money for children and education. Therefore, I wholeheartedly support her 
visa application. 
Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions or 
concerns. 
Best Regards, 
David BlaMe
