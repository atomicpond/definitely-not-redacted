**GOP** fundraiser **Broidy** under investigation 
for alleged effort to sell government 
influence, people familiar with probe say 
Carol D. Leonnig 
**the **Justice Department**** is investigating whether longtime Republican fundraiser Elliott 
**Broidy** sought to sell his influence with the **Trump** administration by offering to deliver U.S. 
government actions for foreign officials in exchange for tens of millions of dollars, 
according to three people familiar with the probe. 
As part of the investigation, prosecutors are scrutinizing a plan that **Broidy** allegedly 
developed to try to persuade the **Trump** government to extradite a Chinese dissident back to 
his home country, a move sought by Chinese President **XI Jinping**, according to two of the 
people. 
They are also investigating claims that **Broidy** sought $75 million from a Malaysian business 
official if **the **Justice Department**** ended its investigation of a development fund run by the 
Malaysian government. The Malaysian probe has examined the role of the former prime 
minister in the embezzlement of billions of dollars from the fund. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 031764 
A **Justice Department** spokeswoman declined to comment. Christopher Clark, an attorney 
for **Broidy**, declined to comment. 
**Broidy**'s alleged activities were detailed in news reports **earlier **this year**** that cited hacked 
emails. The **Los Angeles**-based venture capitalist, who served as top fundraiser for the 
Republican Party and President **Trump**, has said  that allegations against him are an effort by 
his enemies to smear him. 
Rudolph W. Giuliani, an attorney for **Trump**, said he had no knowledge of any request for 
records related to **Broidy**. **the **White **HOUSE****** referred a request for comment to the 
Republican National Committee, which declined to comment.

In **recent weeks**, prosecutors with ****the **Justice Department****'s** public integrity section___which 
examines possible political and government corruption___have sought documents related to 
**Broidy**'s business dealings. 
Among the information sought by investigators are details about **Broidy**'s work on behalf of 
and interactions with the Chinese and Malaysian officials, according to two people familiar 
with the document requests. 
As part of their efforts, prosecutors have subpoenaed casino magnate Steve Wynn, the 
former RNC finance chairman and longtime **Trump** friend, for copies of records and 
communications related to **Broidy**. 
An attorney for Wynn, ****Reid** **Weingarten****, declined to comment, saying only that Wynn is 
cooperating with **the **Justice Department****. 
"Steve Wynn is completely cooperating with the investigation and he certainly has no reason 
to believe that anyone acted improperly in anything he knew about or was involved in," 
**Weingarten** said in a statement. 
Wynn was tapped by **Trump** to serve as the RNC 's lead fundraiser after the election. Earlier 
**this year**, he stepped down from that post and from his executive role at his resort company 
after reports of sexual misconduct. Wynn has denied the allegations of inappropriate 
behavior. 
The public integrity probe is the latest legal challenge for **Broidy**, who helped corral big  
donors to support **Trump**'s presidential campaign, throwing a lavish fundraiser for the then-
nominee at his **Los Angeles**-area home during the **2016** campaign. After the election, he was 
appointed to serve as a national deputy chairman for the RNC. 
**Broidy** sought to parlay his party role and connections to **the **White **HOUSE****** and on Capitol 
Hill in pitches to foreign governments, according to a person with direct knowledge of his 
activities.

In **April**, he resigned from his RNC position in the wake of a report that he had paid a former 
Playboy model $1.6 million in exchange for her silence about a sexual affair. **Trump**'s 
personal attorney, Michael Cohen___another RNC fundraiser___helped arrange the 
settlement, **Broidy** acknowledged.
