****fiscal year**** **2014** Budget issued
On **April** 10 th , **President Obama** issued his ****fiscal year**** **2014** budget. Shortly thereafter, the **Treasury**
Department issued its “Green Book,” which explains the tax provisions in the budget. Although most of
these provisions are familiar and have appeared in previous budgets, a few were new. Here is a selected
overview of some of these provisions, most of which would apply (assuming **Congress** enacts them) as of
**2014**:
• Limit the value of certain tax benefits. As in previous budgets, the current budget proposes to limit
the value of various tax benefits so that they only reduce or shelter income that would be taxed at 28%
or less. In other words, taxpayers with income that would be taxed at the 33%, 35% or 39.6% rate
would see tax benefits curtailed, including ALL itemized deductions (these include deductions for
mortgage interest, charitable contributions and state and local taxes), tax-exempt municipal bond
interest, employer and employee contributions to employer-sponsored health insurance, employee
contributions to retirement plans such as 401(k)s, contributions to health savings accounts and Archer
medical savings accounts, interest on education loans and certain higher education expenses. Because
an affected taxpayer’s pre-tax contribution to her retirement account would be taxed, the account’s
“basis” would be increased accordingly.
Comments. This proposal is not new, but the basis adjustment for retirement accounts is an equitable
provision that was previously missing. Also, because the proposal would apply to income that is taxed
at 33%, 35% or 39.6%, it would increase taxes on some of those **President Obama** has previously
pledged to insulate from higher taxes – namely, individuals with income under $200,000 or married
couples filing jointly with income under $250,000. That is, in **2013**, the 33% tax rate applies to taxable
income in excess of $183,250 (single taxpayers), $203,150 (head of household) and $223,050 (married
filing jointly).
• The “Buffett Rule.” To limit the advantage that high-income taxpayers enjoy from the preferential low
rates on dividends and long-term capital gains, the budget proposes the “Fair Share Tax” (FST), a new
minimum tax designed to ensure that taxpayers pay at least 30% on their adjusted gross income (**AGI**)
(a credit for charitable contributions would be allowed). Translated, this means that if the taxpayer’s
“regular” taxes (including certain credits, the alternative minimum tax and the new 3.8% surtax on net
investment income) and payroll taxes didn’t reach 30%, the FST would make up the difference. The
FST would be phased in starting at $1 million of **AGI**, and would be fully phased in at $2 million of **AGI**
(these thresholds would be indexed for inflation as of **2015**).
Comments. Taxpayers who already pay an aggregate 30% in regular and payroll taxes would not be
subject to the FST – but those who chiefly have income from qualified dividends and long-term capital
gains (and therefore have lower than a 30% effective rate) would see a significant tax increase.
• Restore the **2009** transfer tax parameters. Beginning in **2018**, the transfer tax provisions that were in
effect in **2009** would be restored. The top transfer tax rate would thus be 45% instead of 40%; the
estate tax exclusion and generation-skipping transfer tax (GST) exemption would be $3.5 million, and
the gift tax exclusion would be $1 million (these amounts would not be indexed for inflation). In
computing gift or estate tax liability with respect to these reduced exclusions, taxpayers would not be
affected by “clawback.” That is, they wouldn’t be subject to additional tax if they had taken advantage of
the previous (higher) exclusion amounts (in **2013**, the applicable exclusion amount (AEA) against gift
and estate tax is $5.25 million, and is indexed for inflation; the GST exemption equals the AEA).
“Portability,” which allows a surviving spouse to effectively “inherit” the deceased spouse’s unused AEA,
would continue.
Comments. Despite **President Obama**’s urging to the contrary, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of
**2012** (ATRA), enacted on January 2, **2013**, made permanent most of the transfer tax provisions that
were in effect in **2011** and **2012**: a $5 million exclusion amount, indexed for inflation, against gift and
estate taxes and GST, and portability. (ATRA increased the top transfer tax rate from 35% to 40%.) In
other words, **Congress** just “permanently” stabilized transfer taxes, and is probably not eager to revisit
them anytime soon. Yet the budget proposes relitigating the issue, and reverting to the **2009** regime –
but not until **2018**. Perhaps this is more protest than blueprint.
• Require consistent basis for transfer tax and income tax. The basis of inherited property would
have to equal the property’s estate tax value, and the basis of property received by lifetime gift would
have to equa
