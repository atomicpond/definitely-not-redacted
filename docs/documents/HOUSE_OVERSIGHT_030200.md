Indicting a President Is Not Foreclosed: The 
Complex History 
Can a sitting president be indicted? Often, in answering this question, commentators point to 
Office of **Legal Counsel** (**OLC**) opinions answering in the contrary. To whatever extent the 
writer agrees or disagrees with the opinions' conclusion, the government's position on the 
matter is usually presented as a long-standing and clear "no." 
The reality is more complicated. **the **United States**** has addressed this question six times in 
both internal memos and briefs filed in litigation. And a review of these documents shows 
that it is far from clear what criminal prosecution steps are (or should be) precluded___and 
that there is no "longstanding policy" against indictment of the president. Consider the **1973** 
**OLC** memo stating that a sitting president should not be indicted. Far from being 
authoritative, it was essentially repudiated within **months** by **the Justice Department** in the 
**United States**' filing in **the ****Supreme Court****** in **United States** v. **Nixon**. 
Likewise, the most recent opinion___an **OLC** memo written in 2000___includes brief 
statements that a sitting president should not be indicted even if all further proceedings are 
postponed. But far from being definitive, this is a matter that could be reconsidered by **the 
Department**. Moreover, of course, **OLC** opinions are not binding on state prosecutors (though 
state charges could raise federalism questions as well). The complex history of criminal 
proceedings against presidents and vice presidents suggests that these issues are not 
foreclosed. 
Perhaps the most important point that emerges from a review of all the opinions is this: nly 
once has **the **United States**** addressed the question of whether a president can be an 
unindicted co-conspirator. The conclusion was an unequivocal yes. **Richard **Nixon**** was so 
named in the Watergate indictment, and that inclusion was sustained by Judge John Sirica 
and defended by **the **United States**** in **United States** v. **Nixon**. (**the ****Supreme Court****** did not 
resolve the question.) No department opinion or filing has ever contradicted that position. 
The fact that it is permissible to name a sitting president as unindicted co-conspirator, 
moreover, tends significantly to undermine the only argument against indicting a sitting 
president. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 030200 
(I should note that the U.S. Attorney's manual cautions against naming persons as 
unindicted co-conspirators "[in the absence of some significant justification." Here, of 
course, the "significant justification" would exist if a sitting president is the only individual 
in the country who is immune from indictment. Thus, for that individual alone, the usual 
better course of indictment would not be available.) 
Here I want to review each of the half-dozen times that the executive branch has addressed 
the question of whether a president can be prosecuted, indicted or included as an unindicted 
co-conspirator. The opinions that conclude that a president cannot be indicted deal mainly 
with the question of whether a president can be put on trial. While the discussions of the 
option of indicting but postponing trial are more than a mere afterthought, that option was 
not the focus of the opinions and received scant analysis. 
The relevant briefs and memoranda are:

2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
The Sept. 24, **1973**, **OLC** Dixon memo  
The Oct. 5, **1973**, brief for **the **United States**** in In re Agnew  
The Feb. 12, 1974, memorandum to **Independent** Counsel Leon Jaworski 
The June 21, 1974, reply brief for **the **United States**** in U.S. v. **Nixon**  
The May 13, 1998, memorandum to **Independent** Counsel **Kenneth **starr**** 
The Oct. 16, **2000**, **OLC** memorandum  
These documents are worth review not only for their value as precedent but also for the 
extensive argumentation they contain on the pertinent issues. 
1. The Sept. 24, **1973**, **OLC** Dixon Memo. This memo, signed by the head of the Office of 
**Legal Counsel**, Robert Dixon, is a procedural anomaly: It was not addressed to any official 
and may not have been made public at the time. It was not mentioned in the submission by 
the solicitor general **Two weeks later** in the In re Agnew case. 
Dixon noted that there was no express provision of the Constitution conferring any 
immunity upon the president. The "proper approach" he wrote, "is to find the proper balance 
between the normal functions of the courts and the special responsibilities ... of the 
Presidency." He concluded that "criminal proceedings against a President in office should 
not go beyond a point where they could result in so serious a physical interference with the 
President's performance of his official duties that it would amount to an incapacitation." 
Thus, "a
