Jeffrey, 
Peggy's story is attached to the e-mail. I have included the story in the body of the e-mail as well. 
Thanks, 
Stephanie 
Omar Quadhafi is hunkering down in Tripoli giving press interviews denying that rebels are taking over 
Eastern Libya. Oil prices are shooting over one hundred dollars a barrel. The US government is on the 
verge of a shut down. These are not the top secret opening lines to Aaron Sorkin's new script, but the 
global headlines of a world spinning out of control. I head to Los Angeles like an overdressed lemming to 
attend the 83rd **Academy Awards** and attempt to make sense of artists thrust into combat. 
For **the second year** nearly 6,000 Academy members have nominated 10 films and the battle is down to two. 
The beloved timeless classic, "The King's Speech" marches into the arena as the front runner, but 
passionate supporters of the brilliant edgier (and critics darling) "The Social Network" have not 
conceded. The ballots are counted, the party invites are out and still the feelings are raw. Filmmakers 
are exhausted from campaigning. 
At Bryan Lourd's famous star studded party Sony Classics' Co-President **Michael Barker** announces to me he 
has taken a random sampling of voters in the room. He says, "There will be a 'Social Network' upset at 
the Kodak Theater." Shear panic radiates from my every pore as he says, "I am joking." It's like color 
war at summer camp. 
Woody Allen and George Lucas tell me they are no longer members of the Academy because pitting artists 
against each other to determine the quality of their work is insane. They are right. 
My event and publicity company is considered "Switzerland" by the studios, as we help every filmmaker to 
present and position his work. This year I am somewhat emotionally sucked in. 
In 2005 I meet the unknown 32-year-old English director Tom Hooper on his first film for HBO,"Elizabeth 
I". The Emmy award winning movie stars Helen Mirren, who takes credit for discovering him directing 
English television. Helen later wins her Oscar for portraying **Queen Elizabeth** in "The Queen". Queen 
Elizabeth is the daughter of King George VI portrayed by Oscar winner Colin Firth in "The King's Speech". 
I also become Hooper's champion encouraging many to see his early work including his herculean 10 hour 
HBO mini-series "John Adams" produced by Tom Hanks. 
**Six years later** at the **Telluride **Film Festival**** Tom Hooper is bathing in the glory of a hysterical 
standing ovation with Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush at the very first screening of "The King's Speech." 
Surprisingly, this drama's subtle humor gets big laughs leading up to its emotional ending. 
Within two weeks, at The Toronto **Film Festival**, Harvey Weinstein is now standing with his filmmakers 
witnessing the same reaction. The film wins The Audience Prize. Their strategy is to say nothing. Do 
nothing. They have a possible Oscar winner. Four out of five past Best Pictures have premiered in 
Toronto. 
Cut to **New York City** at the end of September. It's the opening night at The Film Society of Lincoln 
Center. One of America's most important and prolific producers Scott Rudin, along with Jesse Eisenberg, 
Andrew Garfield and Aaron Sorkin are in a brightly lit box waving down to their equally hysterical 
audience who have just seen "The Social Network". 
The film opens the next day to rave reviews and endless publicity. David Fincher is off making "The Girl 
with the Dragon Tattoo". Aaron Sorkin becomes the face of the film and an immediate shoo-in for an Oscar. 
The Hamptons International **Film Festival** in October suddenly becomes a launching pad for "127 Hours", 
where cool Yale/NYU student James Franco appears and receives a heroic standing ovation. More Oscar buzz. 
"Black Swan" also unspools there in a tiny theater as Madonna, Alec Baldwin and even Harvey Weinstein 
slip in the back. Darren Aronofsky, sporting the ever present cool wool scarf around his neck is hailed a 
genius. Natalie Portman is instantly the hot nominee for Best Actress. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012685 
Both films are sensational and movie goers go nuts, but it is "The King's Speech" that edges out the 
competition for The Audience Prize. 
Mid-November **David O. Russell** and Mark Wahlberg, working together for the third time, sneak "The Fighter" 
in Manhattan. As their audience erupts in cheers, I tell producer/actor Wahlberg, "Clint Eastwood is 
going to kill himself for not directing this." Wahlberg says, "You are wrong. He turned it down because 
he's done it. He has seen it and he loves it." I instantly lavish my affection and praise on David O. 
Russell, who becomes my new Clint Eastwood. Christian Bale and Melissa Leo are hailed the supporting 
actors to beat. 
"True Grit" directed by the Coen Brothers and also produced by Scott Rudin doesn't prem
