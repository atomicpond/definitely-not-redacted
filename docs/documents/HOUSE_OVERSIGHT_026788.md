I Never Feel Like Less of an American ... 
I never feel like less of an American than when idealistic teenagers call for gun control, and I know **Congress** 
won't let it happen. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 026788 
I never feel like less of an American than when the richest people abandon the poorest. 
I never feel like less of an American than when a President lies, and his supporters applaud. 
Sometimes it takes the experience of shame to galvanize change, and this is such a time. Having lived too long 
on the self-image of "**America** is the greatest, richest, most powerful country in the world," we produced 
Trumpism, which has shattered that image. It's been a traumatic experience. Mature adults are supposed to be 
resilient in the face of difficult challenges, but a person can bend only so far. That's why one sees an outraged 
Resistance, moving from "He's not my President" to "Is this even my country?" 
If as we often hear, **America** isn't a place on the map but an idea, the idea is in trouble. Every day I'm reminded 
of Sinclair Lewis's **1935** novel, It Can Happen Here, which imagined the election of a Fascist to the 
presidency. As tumultuous as the Thirties were, fascism didn't happen here. In fact, the New Deal and the 
inception of a social safety net came about. But reactionary forces simmer away when they aren't at a boil. Who 
would have thought that the leader of the **HOUSE** in **2018** wants to weaken the social safety net by "saving" 
****Social Security**** and **Medicare**? 
A survey of 117 historians recently ranked Donald Trump the worst President in history, which seems right 
after only one year in office. But what makes me feel like less of an American is knowing that 40% of my 
fellow citizens love and approve of him, who have reservations, yes, but overall want his agenda to move ahead. 
In the **daily** fire hose of presidential offenses, little attention was paid to the revelation by Reince Priebus, 
former ****White **HOUSE****** chief of staff, that however chaotic this Presidency looked from the outside, it was worse 
on the inside--fifty times worse. 
Trumpism is the product of collective consciousness, and although one hears about "the wisdom of crowds," but 
when collective consciousness veers as close to lunacy as this administration, healing is the only answer. 
Reactionary forces, racists, white supremacists, and haters are like algae on the surface of a pond. Algae only 
appears if the pond is dank and still. When water is clear and flowing, there is no condition for algae to thrive 
in. 
The remedies for healing **America** are flowing with more force than before. Notions like **Medicare** for all, free 
higher education, and bringing huge banks to heel were semi-fantasy in the last Presidential election. Now they 
are quickly moving mainstream. Ecological awareness is growing and unstoppable. There is a possibility that by 
destroying **America**'s self-image, Trumpism has opened the way for facing reality, which after all is better than 
living up to a self-image that is hollow at the core. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 026789 
In the meantime, each person needs to remain resilient and relevant. The structure of government moves slowly, 
and it took **decades** of incremental moves for the reactionary right to gain the power it presently holds tight. If 
the midterm elections don't restore sanity, then collective consciousness is more wounded than we imagine. 
Without a doubt Trumpism is horrifying, but the grievances it represents are real. Address those grievances 
honestly and with a clear conscience: that's the only remedy.

There is no doubt that you can benefit from **daily** meditation. It has several health benefits like reducing cortisol 
levels that cause stress, lessening blood pressure, and slowing the heart rate. Besides these physiological effects, 
it can also have a positive impact on your work life, by increasing your attention span, deepening your focusing,
