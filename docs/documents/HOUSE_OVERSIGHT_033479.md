77LLERSON OUSTED 
AS TRUMP SILENCES 
DISSENT IN **Cabinet** 
Pick for CLA. Chief 
Ran Secret Prison 
By ADAM GOLDMAN 
**Washington** — Just over a 
year after the Sept. 11 attacks, the 
C.I.A. dispatched the veteran 
clandestine officer Gina Haspel to 
oversee a secret prison in Thai-
land. Shortly after, agency con-
tractors in the frantic hunt for the 
conspirators waterhoarded a 
**Qaeda** suspect three times and 
subjected him to brutal interroga-
tion techniques. 
Ms. Haspel's time running the 
prison, code-named Cat's Eye, be-
gan her deep involvement in the 
agency's counterterrorism opera-
tions and showed her willingness 
to take part in the agency's rendi-
tion, detention and interrogation 
program, which shaped her ca-
reer. She was a rising star until 
that dark chapter in C.I.A. history 
began to emerge publicly. 
But under **President Trump**, 
her fortunes 
changed, and 
on **Tuesday**, he 
announced that 
he intended to 
name her direc-
tor of the C.I.A.

vation of Ms.

**Washington** — President 
Trump ousted his secretary ot 
state, Rex W. Tillerson, on Tues-
day, the most dramatic in a cas-
cade of personnel moves that sug-
gest Mr. Trump is determined to 
surround himself with loyalists 
more willing to reflect his "Amer-
ica First" views. 
Mr. Trump announced he would 
replace Mr. Tillerson with Mike 
Pompeo, the C.I.A. director and 
former ****Tea Party**** congressman, 
who has cultivated a close rela-
tionship with the president and 
has taken a harder line than Mr. 
Tillerson on critical issues like 
**Iran** and **North Korea**. 
Mr. Tillerson's dismissal, on the 
heels of Gary D. Cohn's resigna-
tion as Mr. Trump's chief eco-
nomic adviser after a dispute ovel 
steel tariffs, pulls the Trump acl 
ministration further out of the eel 
nomic and foreign policy mai 
stream and closer to the nation
