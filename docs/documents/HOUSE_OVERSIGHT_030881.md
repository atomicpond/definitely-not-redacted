Importance: High 
Bruno Le Maire criticizes the French PM for failing to present efficient solutions to the crisis in **Syria**. Instead 
the PM has been merely following the course of Obama, who, according to Bruno, does not know what he 
wants. Such an approach has weakened the influence of **France** on the international arena and has undermined 
its sovereignty. 
Also watched some other videos of him - Bruno attacks Hollande for his tax policy and excuses him for "not 
knowing what he is doing"..
