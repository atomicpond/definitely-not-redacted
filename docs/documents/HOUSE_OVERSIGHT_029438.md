﻿TAX BULLETIN **2018**-1
JANUARY 2, **2018**
0BTAX REFORM SIGNED INTO LAW
OVERVIEW
Without much fanfare but with typical political controversy, the **HOUSE** and **Senate** successfully reconciled their
respective tax bills and the new tax legislation (the “Act”), was signed into law by **President Trump** on December
nd
22P
P, **2017**. **HOUSE** and **Senate** conference committee members leaned in favor of many provisions contained in
the **Senate** proposal. A significant move in that direction was retaining the elimination of the Affordable Care
Act’s individual mandate (the penalty for failing to maintain minimum essential health care coverage) and using
the **Senate**’s methodologies for taxing income from pass-through businesses (though some elements of the **HOUSE**
bill entered into the computation). In other circumstances, a true compromise was reached, such as meeting in
the middle on modifications to mortgage interest deductibility.
In order to abide by **Senate** budget reconciliation rules and ensure the Act does not result in budget deficits outside
the **10-year** budget window, the Act makes almost all changes to individual income tax provisions temporary –
nearly all expire at the end of **2025**. No doubt, this will create tax complexity and political difficulties. On the other
hand, most corporate provisions are permanent. This Tax Bulletin **2018**-1 summarizes certain provisions of the
1
Act and adds observations on income, estate and pass-through taxation.P0F P

OBSERVATIONS – INDIVIDUAL TAXES
Under the Act, there will be winners and losers on the personal income tax side. Generally, wage earners from
5
no-tax statesP4F P could see tax savings under the Act. For instance, a **Florida** taxpayer earning $1 million with
moderate itemized deductions may see a tax savings of about $30,000 under the Act. A similar taxpayer in New
6
York State may see a savings of about $3,500 according to our preliminary analysis.P5F P
Conversely, very high-wage earners from high-tax states could see a higher tax bill. A taxpayer earning $3 million
in **New York City** may see a significant tax increase: $44,000 under the Act, due in part to the loss of significant
deductions. A similar taxpayer in **Florida** would see a tax savings of about $91,000 under the Act (primarily due
to the lower top rate, elongated 35% tax bracket and regaining itemized deductions that are no longer phasedout),
according to our
