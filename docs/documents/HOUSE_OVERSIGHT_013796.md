﻿PRAISE FOR
The 4-Hour Workweek
“It’s about time this book was written. It is a long-overdue manifesto for the mobile lifestyle, and
Tim Ferriss is the ideal ambassador. This will be huge.”
—JACK CANFIELD, cocreator of Chicken Soup for the Soul®, 100+ million copies sold
“Stunning and amazing. From mini-retirements to outsourcing your life, it’s all here. Whether
you’re a wage slave or a Fortune 500 CEO, this book will change your life!”
—PHIL TOWN, New York Times bestselling author of Rule #1
“The 4-Hour Workweek is a new way of solving a very old problem: just how can we work to live
and prevent our lives from being all about work? A world of infinite options awaits those who
would read this book and be inspired by it!”
—MICHAEL E. GERBER, founder and chairman of E-Myth Worldwide and the world’s #1 small
business guru
“This is a whole new ball game. Highly recommended.”
—DR. STEWART D. FRIEDMAN, adviser to Jack Welch and former **Vice President Al** Gore on
work/family issues and director of the Work/Life Integration Program at the Wharton School,
**University of Pennsylvania**
“Timothy has packed more lives into his 29 years than Steve Jobs has in his 51.”
—TOM FOREMSKI, journalist and publisher of SiliconValleyWatcher.com
“If you want to live life on your own terms, this is your blueprint.”
—MIKE MAPLES, cofounder of Motive Communications (IPO to $260M market cap) and founding
executive of Tivoli (sold to IBM for $750M)
“Thanks to Tim Ferriss, I have more time in my life to travel, spend time with family, and write
book blurbs. This is a dazzling and highly useful work.”
—A. J. JACOBS, editor-at-large of Esquire magazine and author of The Know-It-All
“Tim is Indiana Jones for the digital age. I’ve already used his advice to go spearfishing on remote
islands and ski the best hidden slopes of Argentina. Simply put, do what he says and you can live
like a millionaire.”
—ALBERT POPE, derivatives specialist at UBS World Headquarters
“Reading this book is like putting a few zeros on your income. Tim brings lifestyle to a new level
—listen to him!”
—MICHAEL D. KERLIN, **McKinsey & Company** consultant to Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund and a J.
William Fulbright Scholar

world. I devoured this book in one sitting—I have seen nothing like it.”
—CHARLES L. BROCK, chairman and CEO of Brock Capital Group; former CFO, COO, and
general counsel of Scholastic, Inc.; and former president of the **Harvard Law School** Association
“Outsourcing is no longer just for Fortune 500 companies. Small and mid-sized firms, as well as
busy professionals, can outsource their work to increase their productivity and free time for more
important commitments. It’s time for the world to take advantage of this revolution.”
—VIVEK KULKARNI, CEO of Brickwork India and former IT secretary of Bangalore; credited as
the “techno-bureaucrat” who helped make Bangalore an IT destination in India
“Tim is the master! I should know. I followed his rags to riches path and watched him transform

finds a better way.”
—DAN PARTLAND, Emmy Award–winning producer of American High and Welcome to the
Dollhouse

—LAURA RODEN, chairman of the Silicon Valley Association of Startup Entrepreneurs and a
lecturer in Corporate Finance at San Jose State University
“With this kind of time management and focus on the important things in life, people should be
able to get 15 times as much done in a normal workweek.”
—TIM DRAPER, founder of Draper Fisher Jurvetson, financiers to innovators including Hotmail,
Skype, and Overture.com
“Tim has done what most people only dream of doing. I can’t believe he is going to let his secrets
out of the bag. This book is a must read!”
—STEPHEN KEY, top inventor and team designer of Teddy Ruxpin and Lazer Tag and a consultant
to the television show American Inventor
