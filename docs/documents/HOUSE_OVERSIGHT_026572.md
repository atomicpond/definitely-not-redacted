﻿**Global Asset Allocation**
09 **November 2012**
**The J.P. Morgan View**
Do US elections change anything?
� Asset allocation –– The equity market has priced out the Romney win scenario,
but from these levels, our economic and market outlook and risks are
unchanged. These keep us medium-term overweight equities and credit, despite
the likely volatility as the fiscal cliff is negotiated. Within equities, we stay
underweight the US, and move most of the overweight into EM Asia. We have
moved some of our credit overweight from the US to Europe.
� Economics –– The data flows continue to confirm that June/July was likely the
bottom in global activity growth, and that we are gently lifting from those
levels, even as it will take well into next year before growth returns to trend.
� Fixed Income –– Look for yields to head higher, but focus more risk on spread
compression trades.
� Equities –– We focus our overweights on EM Asia, Cyclical stocks and US
Home builders.
� Credit –– We see the current dip as an opportunity to add risk.
� Currencies –– Be long the dollar during the fiscal cliff negotiations.
� Commodities –– A further set of better Chinese economic data keeps us long
base metals.
� Equity markets are taking the Obama victory quite badly, with US stocks
down some 4% on Wednesday and Thursday. This has pushed up global bond
markets, and credit spreads are wider, but commodities are largely ignoring this
turmoil. We don’t think an Obama victory truly changes the economic outlook,
or risks, but it does eliminate the Romney hope that appeared to have been in
market pricing.
� By definition, the Romney scenario is now priced out of the market. The US
elections confirm the status quo in Washington, and to us, they do so also for
the broad economic and market outlook, from current levels. Hence, we do not
see much reason to change our investment allocations, and remain medium-term
overweight both credit and equities against cash, government debt, and
commodities. We do so on the basis of value – still high risk premia – fading
risks on fiscal policy in the US into next year; an expected rebound in global
growth; and super easy monetary policy, with more QE coming if growth were
to disappoint.
� In **recent weeks**, we have switched out of our long-standing US risk overweight,
into an underweight, on the argument that the US had the most committed
central banker, its growth has been least disappointing, and its fiscal risks were
further into the future. This relative risk has changed, with Chinese economic
data confirming that its economy is rebounding, while the ECB now creating a
period a relative financial “peace”. The US, in contrast, is at the start of intense
negotiations on how to avoid a fiscal-cliff induced recession next year. Neither
side of the aisle has an interest in being blamed for a recession. But markets will
still be buffeted by a steady news flow on wide gaps between each side’s
position.

As a result, we stay underweight US equities and have moved risk from our
US credit longs into Europe. Our initial US equity underweight was against
Europe and EM Asia. Our recent downgrade of Q1 growth in the Euro area
and better activity data in China made us move the lion’s share of the
overweight versus the US into EM Asia (see Wednesday’s Global Market
Outlook and Strategy).
Chinese activity data continue to surprise on the upside. October data for
IP, retail sales and fixed investment each came above our expectations. This
creates upside risk, but no change yet, to our forecasts which already assume a
gentle rise in quarterly growth rates from under 7% **early this year** to just
above 8% in Q1. Better data reduce the need for renewed fiscal and monetary
stimulus. The 18th **Party Congress** started yesterday, will last a week, and will
be followed by the announcement of the next leadership. More important for
the economic outlook will be the A
