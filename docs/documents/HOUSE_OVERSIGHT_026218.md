Subject: RE: Plane management 
Importance: High 
Adding Internet and possibly changing cushions. I recommended we do it with the 4 year inspection in **the spring**, but 
haven't heard back from him. I think I talked him out of automating the divans. I agreed with what you said about that.

GV is in inspection and going well. Not sure what renovations you mean? 
On depreciation, we think we cannot use accelerated due to foreign travel preponderance, and obviously can't use 
bonus because not new. We think we are stuck with straight-line depreciation which will be passive. 
Are you saying that **Jet** vs. **EJM** could hinge on the type of plane usage? Not sure I follow that.

Thinking of switching from ******Jet** Aviation**** to **EJM**. **EJM** is more expensive. Do you have a point of view?
