J.E. CASCADING GRAT & INSTALLMENT SALE ANALYSIS
CONFIDENTIAL
Investment products: Not **FDIC** insured • No bank guarantee • May lose value
Please see important information at the end of this presentation.

A sale to an IDGT is a tax-efficient way to transfer future appreciation of an asset
Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (“IDGT”)
• Grantor makes arm’s length sale of assets to an irrevocable trust
• Grantor receives a note for the fair market value of the asset plus interest at current AFR
• Grantor pays income taxes generated by trust assets
• After the note is paid, remaining trust assets pass to heirs gift tax free
• Additional considerations
– trust should be “pre-funded” by grantor to provide sufficient coverage for the note
– having the loan guaranteed by trust beneficiaries may be beneficial
– advisable to allocate GST exemption to trust in order to maximize benefit to heirs
CONFIDENTIAL

Sell asset at fair market value to the trust in
return for a promissory note bearing interest
at proper AFR* based upon term of loan
Receive payments satisfying
terms of note
Pay income tax on trust income and realized
gain
After note is paid off, remaining assets in trust
are available, free of gift tax, for
beneficiaries**

Remaining assets

To enhance the potential benefits consider funding a series of cascading GRATs – the
remainders can be added to the IDGT
If the cascading GRATs are successful, at the end of the cascading GRAT terms
additional assets can be sold to the IDGT
CONFIDENTIAL
* AFRs are defined as: 1) short-term - not over **three years**; 2) mid-term - over three, but not over **nine years**; 3) long-term - over **nine years**.
** If Grantor dies before note is satisfied, the fair market value of the note is includible in grantor’s estate.
2
A “Cascading GRAT” strategy enhances the benefits of a GRAT
• The “Cascading GRAT” strategy uses a GRAT’s annuity stream to fund subsequent
short-term GRATs
– **annual** reinvestment of annuity stream enhances potential value for beneficiaries
• Multiple short-term GRATs allow you to take advantage of
market volatility
– shorter terms permit market “spikes” to be captured immediately
• Short-term GRATs enable you to better manage mortality risks
– if grantor dies during term of trust, the assets in the GRAT are included in the estate
– grantor has greater probability of surviving a shorter term
CONFIDENTIAL

How a “Cascading GRAT” strategy works
1
Grantor transfers asset(s) to an irrevocable
trust. Grantor may manage GRAT assets as
trustee.
2
If necessary, grantor pays gift tax or
uses gift tax exemption on transfer

Grantor pays little or no gift tax, or uses
gift tax exemption*, on present value of

*Gift tax exemption in **2012** shelters up to $5,120,000 per individual of value transferred from gift tax.
**Calculation based on **Treasury** discount rate in effect at time of funding GRAT. A recent **Tax Court** decision (Walton v. Commissioner, 115 T.C. No. 41 (Dec. 22, **2000**))
allows GRAT to be “zeroed out,” eliminating the need to incur any gift tax.

Economic flows of Cascading GRATs
Example
Pre-tax **annual** return of asset
Value of initial transfer to GRAT $50,000,000 **year** Return
**IRS** discount rate 1.60% 1 15.00%
Number of GRATs 4 2 15.00%
Length of strategy **5 years** 3 15.00%
Annuity rate 51.20% 4 15.00%
Escalating annuity percentage 0% 5 15.00%
Term of individual GRATs **2 years** --- ---
Future **IRS** discount rate 1.60%
Note: Assumes grantor survives all GRAT terms
Note: Model does not include income taxes; the ongoing
income taxes generated by the trust are paid by the grantor,
income tax implications should be carefully considered
Note: Model assumes all annuity payments are made in cash
