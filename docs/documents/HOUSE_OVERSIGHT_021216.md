receive Opinion & Analysis Prize 
NEW YORK — The Sidney Hillman Foundation announced **Tuesday** winners of the 69th **annual** 
Hillman Prizes, recognizing a **Reuters** expose of slum-like living conditions on **U.S** military 
bases, the ******Miami** Herald****'s investigation into **Labor** Secretary Alex Acosta's sweetheart deal with 
serial sex abuser, Jeffrey Epstein, and **NBC News** and **MSNBC**'s reporting on the **Trump** 
Administration's family separation policy, among other standout reporting in service of the 
common good. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021217 
Hannah Dreier of **ProPublica** won a Hillman Prize for reporting that showed how the 
government's bungled crackdown on MS-13 has torn apart the lives of Latino immigrants. The 
**Atlantic**'s Adam Serwer, who has emerged as a defining voice of the **Trump** era, won for his 
essays on racism and **Trump**'s political movement, and Anna Clark won for her book on the 
**Flint** water crisis. 
This **year**'s prizes were judged by writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, the New Yorker's Jelani Cobb, 
**Reuters**' Alb( Freedman, the New Yorker's Hendrik Hertzberg, the American Prospect's Harold 
Meyerson and The Nation's Katrina vanden Heuvel. 
The **2019** winners of the Hillman Prizes are: 
• Newspaper — ******Miami** Herald****, Julie K. Brown and **Emily Michot**: Perversion of Justice 
• Magazine — **ProPublica** with New York magazine, Newsday, This American Life, New 
York Times Magazine, Hannah Dreier: Trapped in Gangland 
• Web — **Reuters**, Joshua Schneyer, Michael Pell, Andrea Januta, Deborah Nelson: 
Ambushed at Home 
• Broadcast — **NBC News** and **MSNBC**, Jacob Soboroff and Julia Ainsley: Torn Apart: 
Crisis at the Border 
• Opinion & Analysis — Adam Serwer, The **Atlantic** 
• Book — Anna Clark: The Poisoned City: **Flint**'s Water and the American Urban 
Tragedy, **Metropolitan Books** 
Reporting by this **year**'s prize winners has had significant positive impact, including: 
• Reversal of the **Trump** administration's "Zero Tolerance" family separation policy 
• Three federal investigations, new legislation, widespread repairs, and a $386 million 
emergency program to inspect military housing for hazards 
• The exposure of pervasive bias and negligence by **Long Island** police, leading to federal 
and local investigations and reforms 
This **year**'s honorees follow in the trailblazing tradition of past winners ranging from Murray 
Kempton in **1950** for his articles on **Labor** in the south and Edward R. Murrow in **1954** for his 
critical reports on civil liberties and **Joseph McCarthy** at the height of the Red Scare; to **2017** 
newspaper winner, David Fahrenthold, for exposing Donald **Trump**'s sexual harassment and 
mismanagement of his foundation. 
The Hillman Prizes are open to journalists and subjects globally for any work widely accessible 
to a **U.S**. audience. Winners will be awarded a $5,000 prize at the Hillman Foundation's **annual** 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021218 
ceremony in **New York City** on **May 7**. 
"In a time when this country's highest powers have taken it as their business to demean the 
work of journalists, it is particularly significant for us to honor those who have taken up the 
tools of journalism to challenge corrupt power wherever it may reside," said Hillman judge Ta-
Nehisi Coates. 
In **2011**, the Sidney Hillman Foundation inaugurated the Canadian Hillman Prize. This **year**'s 
winners, Harvey Cashore, Bob McKeown and Kimberly Ivany of **CBC**'s The Fifth Estate, won for 
their sweeping investigation into the research and regulatory failures that have put millions of 
children at risk on their way to and from school each day. Their reporting exposed fraudulent 
science behind Transport Canada's seminal seatbelt study and led the Transport Minister to 
form a task force with the provinces to look at implementing seatbelts on school buses across 
the country. 
The Hillman Foundation announced **Monday** that CUNY professor and historian, Joshua B. 
Freeman, is the recipient of its **2019** Sol Stetin Award for **Labor** History. Freeman has written 
extensively about the history of **Labor**, industry, modern **America**, and **New York City**. The 
Hillman Foundation established the award in **2005** to honor a **Labor** historian who has made 
significant contribution to the field, researching and telling the stories of working peoples' lives.
