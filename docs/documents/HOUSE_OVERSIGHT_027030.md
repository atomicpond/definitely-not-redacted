Obama nominee Penny **pritzker**'s $80 million mistake 
**President Obama**'s billionaire nominee to head the **Commerce Department**, Penny Prizker, understated her 
income by $80 million.

**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 027030 
Hey, these things happen: Penny **pritzker**, **President Obama**'s nominee to lead the **Commerce Department**, 
understated her income by some $80 million and had to file a correction to her government-filed disclosures, 
**Bloomberg** is reporting. 
That might sound like a lot of money, but it's all relative. **pritzker**, whose family founded the Hyatt hotel chain, 
is worth about $1.5 billion. So it's easy to see how a few million — or 80 — could go missing. 
Maybe she left it in the other purse? 
A spokeswoman told **Bloomberg** that the $80 million was "a substantial amount" and that **pritzker**'s advisers 
corrected the error as soon as they realized it. 
Per **Bloomberg**: "Documents released **last week** show **pritzker** received $32.2 million for a **decade**'s worth of 
consulting on the restructuring of domestic trusts," but new filings indicated she made at least $80 million more 
than that.
