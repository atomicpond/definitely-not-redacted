Even self deception acts as a defensive strategy. More later

>> In the summer of 2009, in a talk at the Bristol (UK) Festival of Ideas, Freeman Dyson articulated a vision for 
the future. He referenced "The Age Of Wonder", by Richard Holmes, in which the first Romantic Age 
described by Holmes was centered on chemistry and poetry, while Dyson pointed out that this new age is 
dominated by computational biology. Its leaders, he noted, include "biology wizards" Kary Mullis, Craig 
Venter, medical engineer Dean Kamen; and "computer wizards" **Larry Page** and Sergey Brin, and Charles 
Simonyi. He pointed out that the nexus for this intellectual activity — the Lunar Society for **the 21st century** — 
is centered around the activities of **Edge**. 
>> 
>> Dyson continued to articulate his vision for a new age of biology in a related review inNew York Review of 
Books in which he wrote: "...a new generation of artists, writing genomes as fluently as Blake and Byron wrote 
verses, might create an abundance of new flowers and fruit and trees and birds to enrich the ecology of our 
planet. Most of these artists would be amateurs, but they would be in close touch with science, like the poets of 
the earlier Age of Wonder. The new Age of Wonder might bring together wealthy entrepreneurs like Venter 
and Kamen ... and a worldwide community of gardeners and farmers and breeders, working together to make 
the planet beautiful as well as fertile, hospitable to hummingbirds as well as to humans." 
>> 
>> So, along these lines, who can best articulate the important issues questions we face today than the very 
people who are, through their ideas and entrepreneurial zeal, changing the very nature of reality itself. Here's 
the **2012** Annual Question. Before sending it out widely to the list, it's useful to seed the project with a dozen or 
so interesting responses to provide examples and set a high bar. Even better, to inspire. How about it?? Hope to 
hear from you. JB

>> Scientists' greatest pleasure comes from theories that derive the solution to some deep puzzle from a small 
set of simple principles in a surprising way. These explanations are called "beautiful" or "elegant". Historical 
examples are Kepler's explanation of complex planetary motions as simple ellipses, Bohr's explanation of the 
periodic table of the elements in terms of electron shells, and Watson and Crick's double helix. Einstein 
famously said that he did not need experimental confirmation of his general theory of relativity because it "was 
so beautiful it had to be true." 
>> The **Edge** Question **2012** 
>> WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE DEEP, ELEGANT, OR BEAUTIFUL EXPLANATION? 
>> Since this question is about explanation, answers may embrace scientific thinking in the broadest sense: as 
the most reliable way of gaining knowledge about anything, including other fields of inquiry such as 
philosophy, mathematics, economics, history, political theory, literary theory, or the human spirit. The only 
requirement is that some simple and non-obvious idea explain some diverse and complicated set of phenomena. 
>> [Thanks to Steven Pinker for suggesting **this **year****'s **Edge** Question and to Stewart Brand, Kevin Kelly, and 
George Dyson for their ongoing advice and support.]
