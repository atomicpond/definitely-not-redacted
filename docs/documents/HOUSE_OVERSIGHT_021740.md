Subject: Epstein prosecutor was rebuked for prior child sex case I ****Miami Herald**** 
Attachments: Sp_Marie_Villafana2.jpg; WilliamZloch.jpeg; acosta.jpg

Jeffrey Epstein prosecutor was 
previously rebuked for handling of a 
child sex case 
Julie K. Brown 
**nine months** before cutting a covert plea deal with sex trafficking suspect Jeffrey 
Epstei , Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta was notified that the lead 
prosecutor in Epstein's case had concealed victim information in another underage 
sex crimes case, **the ****Miami Herald****** has learned. 
The prosecutor, A. **Marie Villafaria**, was harshly rebuked by a federal judge in 
**January 2007** for what he called her "intentional and/or serious lapse in judgment" 
when she failed to explicitly inform him that the defendant, a Texas man who 
traveled to Florida to have sex with a **14-year-old** girl, had a prior history of 
predatory behavior with minors, court records show. 
Acosta, her boss at the time, not only knew about Villafaria's breach — records show 
that he subsequently defended it. Acosta assigned another prosecutor in his office to 
write a treatise for the judge in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade him to soften 
the stinging language in his order. 
Senior U.S. **District Court** Judge William J. Zloch copied Acosta on his order, 
noting, "The court is at a total loss as to why the Office of the **United States** Attorney 
for **the Southern District** of Florida, as well as the Assistant **United States** Attorney 
assigned to the above-styled cause, found it appropriate to intentionally withhold ... 
information from the court."

A. **Marie Villafaria** was the lead federal prosecutor in the Jeffrey Epstein sex case. The U.S. attorney's office's handling of 
the prosecution, which led to a plea to minor charges in state court, has been harshly criticized. 
**Later that year**, Acosta and Villafaria put together a plea bargain for Epstein, a 
multimillionaire money manager who sexually abused nearly three dozen teenage 
girls at his mansion in **Palm Beach**. The deal, a federal judge ruled **last month**, was 
intentionally kept from his victims in violation of **the **Crime Victims**' **Rights Act****. 
While the two cases are unrelated, it shows that both Acosta and Villafaria had been 
warned about the importance of victim disclosure in sex crimes cases before the 
Epstein agreement. They nevertheless forged ahead with a pact with Epstein that 
violated the law. 
U.S. **District Court** Judge **Kenneth A. Marra** wrote: "When the **Government** gives 
information to victims, it cannot be misleading. While the **Government** spent untold 
hours negotiating the terms and implications of the [agreement] with Epstein's 
attorneys, scant information was shared with victims." 
This comes as Acosta, who is now the U.S. secretary of labor, is facing mounting 
scrutiny for his oversight of the Epstein case. On Monday, ****White House**** press 
secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to say whether **President Trump** has full 
confidence in Acosta, noting that Acosta's involvement in the Epstein case is 
GG 
currently under review." 
**the Justice Department** launched a probe in January into whether Acosta, Villafaria 
and other prosecutors committed professional misconduct. 
**Francey Hakes**, who worked in ****the Justice Department**'s** Crimes Against Children 
unit, said Zloch's comments were so brutal that it should have deterred Acosta and 
Villafaria from keeping the deal secret. 
"It is highly unusual for a court to allege an assistant U.S. attorney has intentionally 
withheld information. That allegation is like dropping a bomb in the legal 
community," she said. 
The story behind a **Palm Beach** sex offender's remarkable deal 
**Palm Beach** multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein is a free man, despite sexually abusing 
dozens of underage girls according to police and prosecutors. His victims have never 
had a voice, until now. 
"It seems to show that they are not taking these cases very seriously, they are not 
advocating for strong punishment for sexual predators, and not advocating for 
victims in a meaningful way." 
Villafaria, a well-regarded 18-year veteran federal prosecutor, would not comment 
for this story. But her lawyer, Jonathan Biran, said she has worked tirelessly on 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021742 
behalf of **Crime Victims**. She received the 2011 National **Crime Victims**' Rights 
Service Award as well as the Attorney General's Project Safe Childhood Award. 
He also pointed out that the parents of the victim in the Texas man's case wrote a 
letter thanking Villafaria at the conclusion of the case. 
"AUSA Villafaria has spent her 18-year career advocating tirelessly on behalf of 
victims of some of the most serious crimes in Florida, and has received numerous 
awards for her succes
