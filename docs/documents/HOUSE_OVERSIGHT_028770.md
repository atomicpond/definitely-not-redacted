It was not easy as people from **Lifeball** are very difficult. But I go it (they even now approved you - they 
needed to do a background check believe it or not! — as on that dinner will be president of **Austria**, **CLINTON** etc) 
for two tickets — for you and your guest for a price that you do not need to buy a table (as they do not sell 
individual seats). 
**Guy** below is a good friend and he is a CEO of amFAR (amFAR has a joined dinner) — so he helped. 
The nice thing about these tickets is that they are the most VIP. It includes reception, dinner, gala and after all 
party access. 
I have the same ones (through **BILL**). 
I also got two additional for you but it turns out that they are not the same level so I reached to **Kevin** for help. 
The price is 2,500Euro per ticket (this is very reduced price as I think the regular one for this is 15K and it is 
hard to get it). They will need an email from someone from your office and name a your guest asap. 
The plan for for **Vienna** I am sending you with my next email!

Here is the information sheet for **Jeffrey** to buy tickets. Tell him to use my name and the name of **Magdalena 
Schuster** on the email below. They've already approved him to buy tickets to **Lifeball** and the Gala dinner 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 028770 
which happens right before the ball. I hope you guys are all planning to attend the dinner as well. You can tell 
your friend **Jeffrey** that he should buy the **Mini** car for me as a thank you. =) 
I'm getting in to **Vienna** on **Friday** **afternoon**. Let's get together on ****Friday** night**. 
See you soon,
