Whatever the reasons for his resignation, Epstein still gets his 
annual bonus of around $100,000 (roughly $275,000 in today's 
dollars). The SEC never brings charges against him or any other 
Bear Stearns employee. And so the particulars of Epstein's depar-
ture get folded up into the greater mystery surrounding the man. 
Did Epstein crash the rocket ship that Ace Greenberg had given 
him to pilot? Or did he take it and fly it out, over the horizon? 
Either way, Epstein was out on his own. 
For him, the future would only get brighter.

Ana ObregOn: 1982 
CHAPTER 24 
na ObregOn was one of the world's most beautiful women 
and well on her way to becoming famous as such when 
she first met Jeffrey Epstein. For her, there would be film 
roles—in the 1984 Bo Derek vehicle Bolero, Ana ObregOn gives 
the star a run for her money—and appearances on the covers of 
Spanish Playboy and Spanish Vanity Fair. 
As for fortune, ObregOn had that already. 
Ana's father was a very wealthy investor in Spain. But he also 
had serious problems. On June 15, 1982, a venerable stock- and 
bond-trading firm, the Drysdale Securities Corporation, announced 
that it was going out of business. Just that year, Drysdale had spun 
off a subsidiary operation called Drysdale Government Securities. 
And in May, DGS defaulted on $160 million in interest payments it 
owed on Treasury securities that it had borrowed. In doing so, DGS 
had dragged down its parent company.

JAMES PATTERSON 
A very well-connected group of Spanish families—including 
members of Spain's royal family—had invested with Drysdale. 
Those investors stood to lose hundreds of millions of dollars. 
And Ana's father was one of those investors. 
What Ana wanted from Jeffrey Epstein was help in recover-
ing her father's money. 
"My father, he's done something stupid," she told him. 
A Spanish accent. A Brooklyn accent. They blended well 
together, and Ana was so very lovely. 
It turned out that Epstein was willing to help. 
"Something stupid, you see, with the money. The family 
money. Some—what do you call it? A scheme. He knew some of 
the people, but they lied to him. And now the money is gone." 
People who knew Jeffrey Epstein recall that he was bad off after 
his exit or ouster —whatever it was—from Bear Stearns. Mov-
ing from couch to couch for a while. Sleeping in his lawyer's 
offices before settling down in an apartment in the Solow Tower, 
on East 66th Street. 
It's a bit hard to believe. After all, Epstein left Bear Stearns 
with a good deal of money. But Epstein's lifestyle was expensive. 
He was a man on the make then, and Ana was still in her twen-
ties, plying her craft at the Actors Studio — the New York City 
theater institution that Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, Jack 
Nicholson, and Jane Fonda had all been members of. 
Epstein told Ana that he'd formed a company, International 
Assets Group. 
To Ana, this sounded very impressive. In fact, JAG was a 
small operation that Epstein was running out of his apartment.
