﻿Business Standard MUMBAI I **Thursday**, 30 **March** 2017 
After Trump phone call, govt weighs if **Modi** should visit US early 
ARCH IS MOHAN 
**New **Delhi****,29 **March** 
The **Monday** night phone call 
of US **President Donald** Trump 
to **Prime Minister** Narendra 
**Modi** could pave the way for an 
early visit of the Indian PM to 
**Washington**. **The Trump** 
administration is keen to host 
**Modi**. But South Block is look-
ing at the potential deliverables 
from such a visit, particularly 
on H1B visas. The Indian PM's 
political stature has increased 
manifold after his recent elec-
toral successes, while Trump's 
presidential tenure has moved 
from one problem to another. 
**Delhi** doesn't want **Modi** to 
invest his substantial political 
capital to help Trump burnish 
his image, without the visit 
yielding positive results for the 
Indian side. **Modi** is scheduled 
to visit New York to attend the 
UN **General Assembly** in 
**September**. But, **The Trump**-
**Modi** telephonic conversation 
has indicated to South Block, 
and to those who look at foreign 
policy issues within the 
Bharatiya Janata Party (**BJP**), 
that **The Trump** administration 
is keen to host the Indian PM 
for a bilateral visit in the next 
couple of months. 
**Earlier this month**, Foreign 
Secretary S Jaishankar, accom-
panied by **Commerce** Secretary 
**Prime Minister** Narendra **Modi** 
Rita Teaotia, was in the US. Last 
week, **National Security** Advisor 
Ajit Kumar Doval was also on a 
visit to the US. External Affairs 
Minister Sushma Swaraj and US 
Secretary of **State** Rex W 
US **President Donald** Trump 
Tillerson had also recently spo-
**Ken** over the phone. 
In his phone call, Trump 
congratulated **Modi** on his 
recent **State** election victories, 
expressed support for his eco-
nomic reforms and said he had 
great respect for Indians, and 
said he looked forward to host-
ing the PM **later this year**. 
The window for such a visit is 
available in **May**, as well as in 
**June** after the PM attends the 
Shanghai Cooperation Organ-
isation Summit in **Kazakhstan** 
in the second week.The PM's US 
visit could take place before his 
visit to **Hamburg**, in **Germany**, to 
attend the G20 Summit on July 
7-8, and his bilateral visit to **Israel** 
around that time. 
It will be the first-ever visit of 
an Indian PM to **Israel**. The 
highlight of his policy changes 
will be the PM's outreach to the 
Indian diaspora there. **Israel** has 
85,000 Jews of Indian origin. 
Jews are an influential commu-
nity in the US, and some of 
these groups had engaged with 
**Modi** even during his time as 
the Gujarat chief minister. 
According to a source, **Modi**'s 
visit to the US before ****Tel Aviv**** 
could help the PM engage with 
the Jewish community there, 
which would contribute to the 
success of his **Israel** visit. 
On **Tuesday**, the Indo-
American Chamber of 
**Commerce** urged an early visit 
of the PM to the US to "sort out 
the apprehensions" of the Indian 
industry on the negative impact 
of tightening of visa rules relat-
ing to H1B and Li visas.
