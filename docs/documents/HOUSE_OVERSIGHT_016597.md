RECEIVED 
JUL 7 **2008** 
**Town** CLERK 
Pursuant to Section 18-177 of **the **Town** of **Palm Beach**** Code of Ordinances (the "Code"), **Trump** 
Properties LLC ("**Trump**" or "Appellant") hereby appeals to **the **Town** Council** a certain June 25, 
**2008** decision of the Architectural Review Commission ("**ARCOM**") regarding the **Residence** at 
515 **North County Road**, **Palm Beach**, **Florida** (the "**Residence**"). 
Statement of Facts 
**Trump** purchased the **Residence** on January 6, **2005**. The **Residence** was subject to an 
Agreement between **the **Town** of **Palm Beach**** and the prior owner, Abraham Gosman, dated 
January 31, 1990 and recorded in Official Records Book 6350, Page 1207, of the Public Records 
of ****Palm Beach** County**, **Florida** ("Agreement"). The Agreement provides that a hedge 
contiguous to **North County Road** will be maintained and that in the event the hedge is damaged 
or destroyed, it will be replaced. The Agreement refers to the "hedge" in 9 separate places on the 
first page of the Agreement. The Agreement nowhere refers to, or requires, any trees. 
On April 7, **2008** the **Town** gave notice of a code violation alleging that the hedge had not been 
maintained or replaced. The original hedge had been destroyed by the hurricanes of **2005** and 
two subsequent replacement hedges had died due to salt spray. Therefore, **Trump** asked to 
replace the ficus hedge with silver buttonwood hedge material. The **Town** staff advised that such 
decision would have to be made by **ARCOM**. The Appellant appeared before **ARCOM** on May 
28, **2008**. **ARCOM** approved silver buttonwood hedge material. **ARCOM** also requested that 
trees be planted and requested a tree planting plan. **Trump** planted the hedge in accordance with 
the Agreement. 
**Trump** returned to **the Code Enforcement Board** meeting on **June 19, **2008****. That Board deferred 
further consideration of the matter pending plantings requested by **ARCOM**. 
**Trump** appeared before **ARCOM** on June 25, **2008** and (a) sought reconsideration of 
July 3, **2008** 
Page 2 
the request for trees and (b) proved that the hedge that had been planted satisfactorily screened 
the house and complied with the terms of the Agreement. 
Grounds for Appeal 
The action of **ARCOM** was inconsistent with and not in conformity with the provisions of the 
Code and the Agreement which **ARCOM** and **the Code Enforcement Board** seek to enforce. The 
grounds for appeal include the following: 
1. **ARCOM** erroneously interpreted the Agreement to require not only a hedge as specified 
by the Agreement, but to also require the planting of 20 trees behind the hedge. The 
Agreement does not require any planting of trees. 
2. **ARCOM** denied the request by **Trump** to reconsider its position that trees must be 
planted. 
3. **ARCOM** directed that the portion of the existing hedge which was undamaged, located 
north of the driveway into the property, be partially or fully destroyed and replaced with 
silver buttonwood hedge material for purposes of "symmetry". Such a requirement is not 
in conformity with the Agreement. 
4. **ARCOM** abused its discretion in denying Appellant's request since it is unreasonable to 
require new and additional planting outside of the clearly limited requirements of the 
Agreement. 
5. Any action by **the Code Enforcement Board** or **ARCOM** with regard to the Agreement is 
improper and inconsistent with the **Town** Code since **the Code Enforcement Board** can 
only enforce Code provisions and not contractual agreements, notwithstanding any 
language to the contrary in the Agreement. 
**Trump** requests that this appeal be heard by **the **Town** Council** at the meeting on 
August 11,**2008**.
