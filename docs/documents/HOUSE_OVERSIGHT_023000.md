Alan Dershowitz suggests curbing press access 
to hearing on Jeffrey Epstein sex abuse 
**Miami** -A court hearing on whether to

sex trafficking of underage girls by Pa. B.ch 
muft.illionaire Jeffrey Epstein - and the pos-
sible imohement of his influential frien.- will 
play out in a NewYork City courtroom **this week**. 
But it may hap, behind clos. doors, with 
the news m.ia and public barr.- at least in 
Part 
An attorney for lawyer Alan Dershowitz wrote 
a leuer to the US. District Court Second Circuit 
of Appeals onThesday, asking whether die media 
should be exclud. from the .oceeding because 
his oral arguments on behalf of his client could 
contain sensitive information that has been under 
seal. 
The appeals court has not responded to 
concem as of **Friday**, but if die hearing is closed 
during his lawyer, argument it Ariuld represent 
the lat.t in a long hist, of successfid efforts to 
k, details of Epstein, sex crimes sealed. 
Dershowia, a profess. emeritus at **Harvard**, 
constittaional law omen and criminal defense 
attor, represented Epstern who in .8 
received what many consider an unusually light 
sentence for sexually abusing dozens of girls at 
his **Palm Beach** mans ion. TWri women - one of 
whom was underage - have said Epstein and 
his p.net British soci.ite and environmentalist 
**Ghislaine **Maxwell****, directed them to have sex 
with Dershowitz, 80, and other wealthy, powerful 
men. Dershowitz and **Maxwell** have denied the 
claims. 
Oral arguments are scheduled **Wednesday** to 
hear an appeal by **the ****Miami** **Herald****** and other 
parti. seeking to unseal a **2015** court case in-
volving Epstein and **Maxwell**. The **Herald**, as part 
of an ongoing investigation into Epstein, , 
hopes to s. more light on the scope of E.case 
stein, crim., who else might have been involved 
and whether there was any undue influence that 
tainted die criminal justice process. 
A legal brief supporting die Her., appeal 
was filed in **December** by the Reporters Commit-
tee for Fre.orn of the Press and 32 other media 
com,ies, including The New Yo.Times, 
**the Washington Post**, **Dow Jones**, Rec News,

Dershowitz, lawyer, Andrew G. Celli Jr.,
