Hi **Alan** 
I was reading through the files related to the **Jeffrey **Epstein**** case, including the original criminal case where 
you defended Mr. **Epstein**, and saw a letter both you and **Gerald Lefcourt** co-authored on his behalf dated July 
6, 2007. 
The letter said "Mr. **Epstein** was part of the original group that conceived the Clinton Global Initiative, which is 
described as a project 'bringing together a community of global leaders to devise and implement innovative 
solutions to some of the world's most pressing challenges.' Focuses of this initiative include poverty, climate 
change, global health, and religious and ethnic conflicts." 
I just wanted to clarify if Mr. **Epstein** was on the board of directors or listed as a founder anywhere or on any 
paperwork associated with the foundation and if so, in what capacity. Also wanted to clarify what you 
specifically mean by being part of the original group. 
I attached a screen shot of the exact passage I am referring to. 
Thanks, 
Malia
