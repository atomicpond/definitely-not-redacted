Books and newspaper accounts of **Trump**'s **45 years** in business were full of his 
shady dealings, and the presidency had only helped to highlight them and to surface even 
juicier ones. Real estate was the world's favorite money laundering currency and **Trump**'s 
perceived A -level real estate business was quite explicitly designed to appeal to money 
launderers. What's more, **Trump**'s own financial woes, and desperate efforts to maintain 
billionaire lifestyle, cache, and market viability, forced him into constant and unsubtle 
schemes. Practically speaking, you couldn't miss him, as the **Mueller** investigation 
appeared to be finding. 
In **November 2004**, for instance, **Jeffrey **Epstein****, the financier later caught in a scandal 
involving under-age prostitutes, agreed to buy out of bankruptcy a **HOUSE** in **Palm Beach**, 
**Florida** for $36 million—a **HOUSE** that had been on the market for **two years**. **Epstein** and 
**Trump** had been close friends—playboys in arms, as it were—for **more than a decade**, 
with **Trump** always hopeful that **Epstein** would provide some of his financial expertise to 
enabvle h8im to survive. **Trump** was beholden to **Deutsch Bank** and was on the hook 
personally for 40 million dollars. 
**Epstein** took **Trump** to see the **Palm Beach** **HOUSE** to advise him on construction issues 
involved with moving the swimming pool. As he prepared to finalize his deal for the 
**HOUSE**, an incredulous **Epstein** saw a severely cash-constrained **Trump** bid $41 million for 
the property, buying it through an entity named ******Trump** Properties** **LLC****, ultimate owner 
unknown.. **Trump**, **Epstein** knew, had been in the buisness of leasing his name. Hotels are 
actually owned by others but renting the **Trump** name would cost a percent or two. , 
**Trump** was willing to serve as a front man to disguise the actual ownership in a real estate 
transaction. (This was, in effect, just another variation of **Trump**'s basic business model of 
licensing his name for commercial properties owned by someone else.) A furious **Epstein** 
suspected that others actually owned the new **HOUSE**. then getting extensive scrutiny in 
**Florida** papers. The disagreement re the purchase of the **HOUSE** became all the more bitter 
when, **Two months later**, the **HOUSE** was put on the market for $125 million. Well known to 
**Trump**, who often visited with **Epstein** at his **Palm Beach** **HOUSE**, whose visits were 
confirmed in depostions of Epsteins houseman. It appears that **Epstein** was visited almost 
every day, by and had been for **many years**, by girls who he paid for massages with happy 
endings—girls recruited, and who often returned to his **HOUSE** from the local massage 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 030974 
parlors strip clubs, and, also, **Trump**'s Mar-a-Lago. Just as the threats and enmity of the 
two friends increased over the **HOUSE** sale, **Epstein** found himself under investigation by 
local **Palm Beach** police. **Epstein**'s legal problems vastly escalated but the new **Trump** 
property, with only minor improvements, was bought 3 years later in 08 , the time 
**Trump** was facing his huge debt. for $96 million by **Dmitry **Rybolovlev****. a Russain oligarch. 
That is, **Trump** had either miraculously earned $55 million, without putting up a dime, or 
**Rybolovlev**, or someone such as **Rybolovlev**, paid ****Trump** Properties**, **LLC**—actual owner 
unknown—$96 million, thereby providing a clean payment of $55 million to 
someone. This at the very same time that **Trump** was into **Deutsch Bank** for over 600 
million dollars but with a 40 millino personal guarnatee .**Rybolovlev** might have, in effect, 
paid himself for the **HOUSE**, thereby cleansing the money. **Epstein**, on his part, would be 
senetenced to 30 months, 12 of those months in jail on a prostitution charge. 
After the election, when Bannon was introduced to **Epstein**, Bannon told him, "You were 
the one person I was truly afraid of coming forward during the campaign." 
"not surprising" said **Epstein**.
