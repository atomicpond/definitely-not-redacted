EU BANKS: BIG EQUITY OUTFLOWS BUT REMAIN UPBEAT ON REFLATION TRADE 
Spec Sales Comment: 
Big Equity outflows but we see this is a pause not a reversal 
BofAML latest flow show data this morning shows the largest equity outflows in 40 weeks and first 
outflows YTD (click here). Our BofAML Bull & Bear Indicator is now at 7.1, the highest level since Jul'14 
and not far from "sell" signal. So is this just a pause for breath in the reflation trade? BofAML strategists 
think so. In our updated thoughts this morning we think reflation is real so stay long equities, short rates, 
selectively long USD (click here).

Why do we remain bullish the reflation trade? 
The main reasons for equity investor concern in **recent weeks** = the gap between hard and soft data, plus 
the delay in the **Trump** fiscal package

We continue to believe in the reflation theme because: 
1. Strength in the global economy is genuine - European PMIs are at 6 year highs, Chinese and 
Japanese PMIs continue to improve too. In fact —90% of PMIs globally are above 50 and 60% have 
increased in the last 3 months. 
2. Earnings revisions and Global Wave point to continued upturn - earnings revisions now 
above 1.0 for the first time since **2011**. 
3. We expect **Trump** to deliver on tax, even if it is smaller than hoped for - should such a 
package be put together it would likely support the **Trump** trade once again after the failure to reform 
**Obamacare** 
4. Bond markets are being too sanguine about the likely pace of **Fed** tightening - the **Fed** 
funds curve is once again well below the dot plot. We continue to see upside in yields if and when the 
market becomes more convinced that the soft data is right.

European Banks holding up better than US Peers on pull back 
In Banks, the reoccurring feedback from investors has been that clients have rotated out of US banks and 
into European banks. This conflicts with our latest **Fund Manager Survey** which suggested allocation to 
European Banks fell the most of any sector MoM in the first two weeks of March, however, its true 
European Banks have quickly reversed the performance gap to US peers. The spread between the SX7E 
and S5BANKX Index is back to pre-US election levels. 
What the EU banks bulls are saying: 
**EUR** rates are going higher it's just a matter of timing, positive **EPS** revisions continue, EU is starting to 
see pockets of volume growth and asset yield recovery, credit spreads have been tightening YTD and

attractive valuations of EU banks vs. US peers (EU banks on 12.0x 2017E PIE vs. US Banks on -14x and 
some EU banks still on a large discount vs **10-year** historical median P/B valuations). 
What the EU banks bears are saying: 
EU macro declining, US lead re-flation trade cooling (tax, deregulation, healthcare headwinds) and toppy 
multiples/high ownership of EU banks going into Q1 results. They believe the pressure will be off Draghi to 
act on the deposit rate if the macro starts to reverse which may cause people t
