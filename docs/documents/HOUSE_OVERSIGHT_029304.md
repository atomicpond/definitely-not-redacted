## Document Text

```
THE **Trump** ORGANIZATION 
July 11, 2011 
To whom it may concern: 
For **the past three years**, I have enjoyed a daily working relationship with **Michael** 
Bocci°, having trusted him with many of my personal and business endeavors, in his 
capacity of Managing Director of **Business Development** and **Special Counsel**. 
**Michael** was a person that I would call into my office and could always count on for a 
smart point of view. **Michael** is as comfortable in a boardroom negotiating critical 
business points as he is drafting a complex legal document. He naturally assumed a 
leadership role in any task that I assigned to him. He has prospered under my mentorship 
and I relied on him as an asset to every area of my business. 
I highly recommend **Michael** for employment or consideration as a partner in any 
business venture. He will make any company or individual that may be lucky enough to 
work alongside him more effective, efficient and profitable. 
incerely 
Donald **Trump** 
725 FIFTH AVENUE • NEW YORK, NY 10022 • 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 029304
