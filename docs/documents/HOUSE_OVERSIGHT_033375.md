Meetings here in PB are winding down. How's your day look tomorrow? 
Separately, do you know Oleg Deripaska or Ivan Glasenberg?

Unfortunately, bin Sulayem and I did not meet. I was stuck at **the **White House**** and he had a narrow window 
before heading to **Cyprus**. I just sent him the following note: 
"Good Morning, I hope your travels to **Cyprus** were smooth. 
Okey Enelamah, **Nigeria**'s trade minister, stopped by my home this evening as he was still in town after 
**Buhari**'s visit with Trump. He mentioned his discussions with you at WEF and afterwards. Separately, I spoke 
earlier with the **Vice President**. 
Whenever we meet, I have some thoughts that may be helpful to you."

Thank you for the introduction. Do you have a better sense of what he needs? Also, what's his 
**WhatsApp**/mobile so I can confirm details for **today**? 
When's best on **Friday** for me to visit with you? 
**Bibi**'s speech was a bit of a dead letter on **Europe**.
