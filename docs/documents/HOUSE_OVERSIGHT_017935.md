﻿Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 1 of 28
United States District Court
**Southern District** of New York
VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE,
Plaintiff,
CASE NO:
v.
ALAN DERSHOWITZ,
Defendant.
________________________ /
COMPLAINT
Boies Schiller Flexner LLP
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 2 of 28
Plaintiff, VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE, formerly known as Virginia Roberts (“Roberts”), for
her Complaint against Defendant, Alan Dershowitz (“Dershowitz”) avers upon personal
knowledge as to her own acts and status and upon information and belief and to all other matters:
NATURE OF THE ACTION
1. This suit arises out of Defendant’s defamatory statements of and concerning
Plaintiff.
2. During 2000-2002, beginning when Plaintiff was 16, Plaintiff was the victim of
sex trafficking and abuse by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
3. Epstein’s trafficking scheme involved recruiting young girls, often by claiming
they would be paid $200 for simply providing a massage to a wealthy billionaire. The young girl
would then be brought up to Epstein’s bedroom where Epstein would be on a massage table;
Epstein would then sexually abuse the girl. This same pattern was repeated numerous times with
numerous children.
4. “From between 1999 – 2007, Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused more than 30 minor
girls…in his mansion in Palm Beach Florida, and elsewhere in **the United States** and overseas…
In addition to his own sexual abuse of the victims, Epstein directed other persons to abuse the
girls sexually. Epstein used paid employees to find and bring minor girls to him. Epstein
worked in concert with others to obtain minors not only for his sexual gratification, but also for
the sexual gratification of others.” United States District Court Judge Marra February 21, 2016
Summary Judgement Order at 2, Case No.: 9:08-cv-80786 (internal citations omitted). One of
the persons with whom Epstein acted in concert was Dershowitz.
5. Like other minor children who came before and after her, Plaintiff was initially
recruited to provide massages, and thereafter to engage in a variety of sexual acts, for Epstein.
2
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 3 of 28
Plaintiff was required to be on call for Epstein for sexual purposes and frequently traveled with
him both nationally and internationally. Plaintiff was regularly abused by Epstein and was lent
out by Epstein to others for sexual purposes.
6. Defendant Dershowitz was Epstein’s attorney, close friend, and co-conspirator.
Dershowitz was also a participant in sex trafficking, including as one of the men to whom
Epstein lent out Plaintiff for sex.
7. When Epstein was arrested for sex trafficking in 2006, Dershowitz defended his
friend and client by falsely attacking the veracity of his accusers, including calling the children
whom Epstein had abused (and, in the case of Plaintiff, the Defendant himself had also abused),
liars and prostitutes.
8. Despite his significant criminal activity, Epstein’s criminal charges were resolved
by a guilty plea to a single Florida state law charge and a non-prosecution agreement (a “NPA”)
with the U.S. Attorney for **the **Southern District**** of Florida. Unknown to the public and the
victims at the time, Epstein’s lawyers, including Dershowitz, were pressuring the Government to
commit to the NPA without informing the victims. Epstein’s multiple victims, including
Roberts, were kept in the dark and told to be “patient” while Dershowitz participated in the
drafting of the NPA and worked to protect Epstein and other “potential co-conspirators”
(including himself) from prosecution.
9. On July 7, 2008, a challenge to the NPA was brought on behalf of two of
Epstein’s victims (not including Plaintiff) based on the fact that, contrary to the requirements of
the Criminal Victims’ Rights Act (the “CVRA”), the NPA had been concealed from Epstein’s
victims.

Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 4 of 28
10. In December 2014, Roberts, who had not initially been part of the CVRA action,
was asked to, and did, provide information to Plaintiffs’ counsel in the CVRA case in which she
discussed her sex trafficking by Epstein. On December 31, 2014, Plaintiff’s counsel in the
CVRA proceeding (Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell) filed a Motion Pursuant to Rule 21 for
Joinder in the Action (“Joinder Motion”) on behalf of Roberts. Ms. Roberts’s joinder motion
described how she had been sexually trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein and was forced to have sex
with, among others, Alan Dershowitz.
11. Based on Plaintiff’s December 2014 filing, Dershowitz, as he had previously done
to Epstein’s victims, publically and viciously attacked plaintiff’s counsel in the CVRA actions,
Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell. Dershowitz, in nationally televised news interviews, wrongfully
claimed that Edwards and Cassell had engaged in unethical behavior warranting disbarment for
filing **the Joinder Motion** that described Dershowitz’s involvement with Epstein and Roberts.
