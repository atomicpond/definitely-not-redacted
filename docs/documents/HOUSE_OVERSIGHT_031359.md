Purpose of the Convention
Nobel Charitable Trust Earth Environment Convention (tentative)
■**NCT** will host the awards and convention.
Hosting Awards and the Convention
■Hosting the convention is not **NCT**’s ultimate objective. Rather, **NCT** strives to promote excellent energy
efficient products and the development of renewable, alternative and sustainable energy resources through the
convention and to financially support corporations and individual(s) aiming to develop such products.
Right to Carry the Accreditation Mark
■Awarded products will have the right to carry the **NCT** accreditation mark (**NCT** No.1234).
■Awarded products will enjoy high status and recognition as a product accredited by the prestigious Nobel

Basic Policy Plan of Hosting the Convention
Points to Keep In Mind in Hosting the Convention(Direction of Hosting the Convention)
1.Host Country
■In the future we will construct a framework where different countries will
rotate to host and support the Convention.
■To establish an implementation model as well as build recognition and
**Success**, the first 3 to 4 Conventions will be held in **Japan**.
that the source of information (the
convention) should start in **Japan**
■One of the most well-known environmental instrument is the Kyoto
Protocol adopted in **Japan**. Despite the many environmental conferences
taking place around the world, no event has ever included an exhibit ion
of environmental technologies . Therefore, it is a natural course of
events, that this Convention should begin in **Japan**, which would carry a
significant message . Global consensus on this matter should be easy
to attain.
2.Venue
■Venue candidates include Kyoto from the Kyoto Protocol, and
Okinawa and Hokkaido from the past G8 summits but considering
factors such as transportation, operation and promotion, we would
like to recommend the **Tokyo** Big Sight (**Tokyo** International
Exhibition Center.)
3.Timing of the Conference
4.Exhibitors (Corporations)
■With the cooperation of governments around the world, **NCT** will
encourage corporations worldwide to participate in the exhibition.
■Participation of Japanese corporations will be managed through the
future energies organization (GSSI Earth Environment Technology
Development Expo **Executive **Committee****)
(Anticipated number of participating corporations: from 500 to 1000)
5. Advantages in Participating in the Exhibition
■By participating, corporations will have the opportunity to introduce and promote
their energy efficient products, obtain information on renewable, alternative and
sustainable energy resources, and may obtain rights to or participate in projects.
■By positioning participation itself as a status symbol, higher awareness will be
seen in corporate efforts to engage in environme
