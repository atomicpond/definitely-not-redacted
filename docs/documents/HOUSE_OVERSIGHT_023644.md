## Document Text

```
﻿The text of the television interview of the Deputy Crown Prince: Prince Mohammed bin Salman:
The Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdul Aziz, the Deputy Crown Prince, the Second Deputy of the Prime Minister, and the Chairman of the Council for Economic Affairs and **Development**, has held a television interview on ****Saudi Arabia****'s first channel for the most important local and regional issues, and he stated the followings:
* The national transformation program was designed to improve the performance of government agencies?
- That’s true, and for this reason there are indicators and targets have entered in 24 government agencies, the second batch will be launched in the near future or **the coming weeks**, and there are new entities, that were not included in the 24 parties in the national transformation program, will be added to it.
* Now it is been **a year** since the establishment of 2030 vision, How do your Highness see its impact on the growth, the unemployment and non-oil income? 
- I think that it has achieved so many achievements. If we look at 50 thousand feet, we will find that the deficit rate is less than all analysts’ anticipation, both at home and abroad for 2015 and 2016. And also for the budget of 2017 we will find non-oil revenues almost doubled in **these years**, "**the last two years** from nearly 111 billion to nearly 200 billion Saudi riyals. We will also look at the fact that budget control has become much more accurate than a budget in **the **last year****, which spends more than 25 % to 45 % to a budget where only less than 10 % is spent. All of which are more than 50,000 feet. In addition to that, the main economic indexes have been affected by eighties, the nineties, and 2009 fall in oil prices such as the unemployment index which increased in those sharp declines, while the inflation index rose very significantly. The investment index also fell very strongly, while in this crisis the oil prices fell very sharply in an unprecedented manner in the history of **the **Kingdom** of ****Saudi Arabia****** and in a very rapid pace until it reached 27 dollars in a short period, and continued at this abysmal level for **a year** and **more than **a year****. But, thanks to God, thanks to the guidance of his majesty the king, and the work of government agencies and officials and government employees who were able to maintain a lot of indexes without being affected negatively. Unemployment was maintained at its level and was not strongly affected negatively. Inflation was also not strongly affected negativly as the historical cases we have seen in the past. The investment index was not affected strongly and the growth index continued to rise on the GDB. It is true that it is below the global average but we have not entered a stage of contraction in the Saudi economy. Now the effects of these programs that will be launched will start to appear in **late 2017**. We will find their very strong impact starting from 2018 and 2019 on all these key economic indexes.
* Your Highness, Prince, with regard to the issue of unemployment from the beginning of this year and with the recession that the local market suffered, there was a layoff for people from their jobs, what is the plan for that? 
- As everyone knows, that any reform process and any screening process of the country will be accompanied by side effects. It is very normal with the oil drop to $ 27 and its continuation for a long time less than $ 40 have a lot of symptoms affecting the state spending. These ten programs are all in the different areas of spending between investment and spending from the private sector, which is a major incentive for jobs in **the coming years**. As everyone knows, the aim of Vision 2030 is to reach a 7% unemployment rate in **the **Kingdom** of ****Saudi Arabia******. With no doubt, these programs will make us into a better number than we are today in 2020.


* What is the reason for the suspension of allowances, and why they were returned?
- If we note, in the decision to stop allowances that it was temporary, and that in the same resolution there is a text that states that the decisions are reviewed periodically. And they were reviewed appropriately after the improvement of our oil revenues. This is a factor, and as you know in the program "financial balance" we had three scenarios for Oil which are:  the pessimistic scenario $ 45, the average scenario or a baseline of $ 50, and the optimistic scenario of $ 55. This is not the **Kingdom**'s assessment for oil, but this is to arrange our securities with different oil prices. In **the first quarter**, we were close to the optimistic scenario which is $ 55, sometimes we go beyond it and sometimes we are less than, this is a positive element. The other positive element is that our non-oil revenues in **the first quarter** of 2017 have achieved more than we anticipate to achieve. This is another positive element, so the decision is no longer has to continue in this manner. So that, it was reviewed as stated in the resolution itself, while we exaggerate
