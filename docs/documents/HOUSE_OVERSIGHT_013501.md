ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Appreciation is expressed to the Fetzer Institute for their support of this work.
Particular thanks are due their imaginative Vice President, Dr. Paul Gailey, who shared my
vision and hope that these somewhat disparate themes could be blended into a meaningful
whole. Time and the reading by others will tell whether this idea was realized. The Fetzer
Foundation and Dr. Gailey have facilitated exploration into blends of science and
spirituality, particularly in the context of personal meaning. They also have a history of
supporting serious work in this era’s most powerful and rigorous exercise in holism as
represented by the mathematical and applied mathematical fields of modern dynamical
systems theory. Fetzer’s very special environment and years of dedication have
encouraged the variety of personal meanings within science to emerge and be recognized
as legitimate and important parts of the research enterprise. It would be difficult to imagine
a more propitious context for this effort.
The book is dedicated to my daughter Buna, and to my intellectual and creative
companion, Dr. Karen Selz, whose deep and lovely mind wrote much more of this book
than is formally acknowledged.

CHAPTER 1:
IN SEARCH OF THE MIRACULOUS
More than a half-century of naïve persistence and driven search for unity in
the biophysics of mind and personal spirituality as the basis for healing
transformation has led me into many laboratories. The motivation may have been
genetic. My father said that we were descended from several generations of Jewish
mystics, none of them able to attain the salaried status of rabbi or cantor. These
ecstatic men lived lives of peripatetic eccentricity, stirring congregations with
provocative insights and uncomfortably personal inquiry. But only for a little while.
Soon they were asked to leave the synagogue and often their Eastern European
Jewish townships called shtetels as well.
My father, in the first generation of our family without rabbis in over a
Century, was a businessman-musician, who in the early mornings studied Talmudic
commentaries. He taught me about why it was that most interpretations of the book
by the rational, physician, lawyer, philosopher, Moses Maimonides, called Guide for
the Perplexed, were in error in their assumption that man cannot understand God’s
nature with his mind. He took issue with the opinion that the union of a person’s
intellect and Spirit with Him was not possible as long as a person was living. Ibn
Tibbon, Maimonides’ best-known early translator and interpreter, relegated the
cognitive, analytical, physical and alchemical transformational sciences to the
earthly, not spiritual realm. My father disagreed. He espoused the work of the 13 th
4
Century proponent of a school of Jewish ecstatic mysticism, Abraham Abulafia,
whose interpretation of the Guide and his own Commentary on the Secrets taught
that the human mind, if transformed into a “state of active intellect,” could become
one with Spirit, realizing the Kingdom of God in rational mystical experience in a
state of excitement with new ideas. The new consciousness achieves deep
knowledge of both the “upper” and “lower” realms of what he called “reality” both
spontaneously and directly. He said that without personal transformation, this
knowing is not possible.
Abulafia’s lesson was that the mundane intellect of man has the potential for
transformation into another kind of mind in a spiritualization of thought. This occurs
via developmental stages that begin with intellect and imagination and culminate in
what he called prophetic emanations. The exercises leading to this transformation
are to be strongly willed and practiced with regularity. This work results in ascension
to an ecstatic state accompanied by great intuitive powers, which Abulafia called
“prophesy.” Ibn Adret, the Chief Rabbi of Spain at the end of the Thirteenth Century,
banished Abulafia from the Country, a Century before the Spanish Inquisition
ousted all the Jews.
Following what my father said was required in the practice of Kabbalah, a
13 th Century tradition of esoteric and mystical interpretations of the Scriptures, I
learned the secret meanings of each of the twenty-two letter Hebrew alphabet.
Much like the Platonic view of mat
