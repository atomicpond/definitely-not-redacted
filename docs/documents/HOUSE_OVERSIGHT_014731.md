﻿Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead
Tectonic shifts
16 November 2016 Corrected
Our top 10 Rates, FX & EM trades for 2017
FX and Rates
Global
1. Short US 5y rates – Two and a half Fed hikes priced by the rates market for 2017-
18 are not consistent with aggressive fiscal easing promised by Trump.
2. Short US 10y real rates – After the violent repricing of inflation breakevens, we
believe real rates offer better risk-reward to position for higher rates.
3. Buy USD/JPY – With the BOJ pegging 10y JGB yields at zero, we expect this highly
interest rate sensitive USD cross will continue to be the biggest beneficiary of the
Trump win.
4. Sell a basket of Brazilian, Mexican, and Colombian long bonds – Positioning in
EM fixed income market remains crowded while liquidity is poor.
5. Sell BRL/MXN – MXN is oversold but BRL will likely be vulnerable to the divergent
paths between Brazil’s easing and the Fed’s tightening cycles.

6. Buy USD call/CNH put – President Trump will need a weak USD, but President Xi
needs a weak CNY. We believe risk premium for a collision course is too low.
7. Sell EUR/GBP – Brexit and Trump could bolster the anti-globalization parties in
Europe ahead of key elections next year.
8. Sell Eurozone 30y inflation breakevens – We think investors should take
advantage of the recent rally to sell into the December ECB meeting, which could
disappoint.
9. Sell EUR/RUB – Likely OPEC production cuts on November 30 and possible
sanction relief for Russia are bullish for the RUB, in our view.

10. Buy NZD/USD put spread – Spot NZD/USD is forming a head and shoulders top
pattern that suggests a decline will follow in 2017.

Introduction
David Woo
MLPF&S
david.woo@baml.com
First came Brexit, then Donald Trump’s election as the president of the most powerful
country in the world. The world has changed. Possibly irrevocably so.
These ground shifts have been brought on by a backlash to globalization, increasingly
viewed as the culprit for wage stagnation (Chart 1), growing disparity of income and
wealth between the rich and the poor (Chart 2), and the loss of national identity. We
suspect the trend of anti-globalization is here to stay.

Wide-ranging consequences for financial markets
In our view, the anti-globalization theme will have at least seven major consequences
for financial markets in 2017.
1. Monetary easing will give way to fiscal easing
The history of populism is one of fiscal largesse. Furthermore, with limited scope for
further monetary easing, fiscal easing is becoming the last and only resort for
policymakers. It seems reasonable to assume that the combination of these two factors
will soon usher in a period of easier fiscal policy.
Nowhere will the impact of fiscal easing be felt more than the US in 2017, in our view.
The GOP has achieved a rare clean sweep in the latest elections. During the 18 years
that a single party controlled both the Presidency and Congress since 1965, US
structural budget balance as a share of potential GDP deteriorated by 0.4pp a year on
average (Chart 3). In other words, history tells us that a clean sweep is usually a recipe
for fiscal stimulus. The GOP has the additional incentive to use fiscal easing to boost
economic growth ahead of the mid-term elections in 2018. The Republicans will need to
pick up at least eight more seats in the Senate to accomplish their stated objectives of
repealing Obamacare and Dodd-Frank (Chart 4). We think the Republican controlled
