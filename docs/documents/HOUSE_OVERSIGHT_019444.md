BIOLOGISTS DIG DEEPER 
**Canada**'s new Biotron superlab contains miniature chunks of the natural world that 
will help us predict the impact of climate change on living organisms 
BY LINDSAY BORTH WICK 
GROUP OF PLANT SCIENTISTS GATHERED IN **Vienna** IN **2005** AT THE 
International Botanical **Congress**. The meeting was pretty much what you would 
expect until its conclusion, when the **Congress** declared: "As a matter of urgency, 
facilities for controlled, ecosystem-scale experiments are required now." With-
out a better toolbox to study how the natural world responds to global climate 
change, "sustained human habitability of **Earth**" would be at risk. 
Fortunately, just such a toolbox was already being designed by Norman 
Winer, a Canadian biochemist and plant biologist. Htiner had begun work on his Biotron Institute for 
Experimental Climate Change Research in **1999**. In early 2008 it will open its doors, the first facility in the

Peace in 
The Garden 
LAST FALL IN THE GERMAN 
city of Kassel.. a group of 
about 15 women harvested 
a bumper crop of pumpkins, 
squash, and wine grapes 
from a small community gar-
den. Nothing unusual there, 
perhaps—except that the 
women were from **Morocco**, 
**Afghanistan**, **Somalia**, and 
the former **Yugoslavia**. 
The "intercultural garden" 
in Kassel is one of about 100 
in **Germany**, but the only one 
run entirely by women. (And 
after the gardeners had long 
discussions about the haz-
ards of pesticides, its produce 
will be totally organic.) The 
gardens began in 1495, after 
a group of Bosnian women 
in Gottingen, waiting out the 
Balkan conflict, told social 
workers how much they 
missed the famous plum and 
apple orchards of **Bosnia**'s 
Drina Valley. 
There has been adversity 
along the way. A garden in 
**Berlin** had to be placed under 
police protection after it was 
targeted by neo-Nazi protest-
ers. In Cologne the gates of 
another garden have been 
destroyed three times. And it 
isn't always easy to coax tra-
ditional crops such as Afghan 
mint, coriander, and Iranian 
leeks from the mineral-rich 
German soil. Yet the gardens 
thrive. Says Behoumi, a 
**31-year-old** from **Morocco**, 
"Without the beauty of the 
garden I could not survive."

world that will allow researchers 
to re-create and study how a com-
plete ecosystem, such as **Arctic** 
tundra or boreal forest, responds 
to climate change. The Biotron, 
Hiiner says, is "as close as you 
can get to nature [in a lab]." 
The Biotron will help integrate 
biology into the scientific study of 
global warming. Existing climate 
change models, says Hillier, are 
more about physics than biology; 
moreover, they describe changes 
that are happening to the planet 
rather than to particular habitats, 
species, or individuals. Scientists 
haven't been able to create pre-
dictive models, for example, 
of how changes in rainfall and 
researchers tested in two sepa-
rate "missions" whether humans 
could live sustainably in a sealed, 
self-contained environment as 
a precursor to colonizing outer 
space. The Biotron, scientifically 
speaking, is in a different league. 
The superlaboratory is a 
joint project of the University of 
Western **Ontario**, the University 
of Guelph, **Ontario**, and Agricul-
ture and Agri-Food **Canada**, a 
federal agency. The nondescript 
five-story building, located in the 
agricultural heartland of south-
western **Ontario**, is an engineer-
ing marvel, yet a bargain at just 
U.S. $28 million. 
Inside are state-of-the-art fa-
cilities that support research into 
microorganisms, insects, and 
plants, all of which can be geneti-
cally modified to suit research-
ers' needs. Temperature in the 
Researchers will vie for access to 
the Biotron much as physicists compete 
to use the world's few particle _ 
accelerators or astronomers the latest and 
biggest optical telescopes 
temperature will affect soybean 
yields in the U.S. grain belt or 
butterflies in the **Amazon** basin, 
because, with a few exceptions, 
they haven't had the tools to 
measure the impact of climate 
change on living organisms. 
Now there's a place where 
whole ecosystems can be scrupu-
lously re-created and organisms 
scrutinized, from their DNA to 
their interaction with other organ-
isms. With more complete data, 
scientists will be able to make 
better predictions—and (heir ex-
perimental findings could better 
inform policy makers, who might, 
for example, provide subsidies for 
crops that respond well to emerg-
ing climate patterns. 
The Biotron may call to mind

habitat plopped down 20 years
