Subject: Fwd: Obama team nixed fundraiser by attorney for sex offender pal of Bill Clinton, emails show 
Importance: High 
This guy black might be your lawyer and even a friend; but i have to say it seems to me he is much more about 
himself than his clients. 
He made a comment in a newspaper about a case of mine not long ago and he had no idea what he was talking 
about; he should have been embarrassed. When i asked a reporter from one if the leading newspapers why the 
other paper had run his opinion about my casr when he knows nothing about it, she said his p.r. people email 
and others regularly with comments on all sorts if cases just hoping to get black's name in the paper in some 
pseudo authoritative role. Pretty weak. 
Good luck, David

I thought you might be interested in this article: 
One of **America**'s top defense attorneys was deemed too controversial to host an event for President Obama, 
according to newly surfaced emails, mainly because of one particular client — a jet-setting billionaire accused of 
trafficking underage girls, who also happens to be close friends with Bill Clinton.
