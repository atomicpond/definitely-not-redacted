﻿IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON **September 11, 2001**
Cite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)
765
tain general jurisdiction over them, all
claims asserted against those individual
defendants are dismissed for lack of personal
jurisdiction.
3. Plaintiffs Are Entitled to Jurisdictional
Discovery as to Privatbank’s
Investing Activities in the United
States
[37] Plaintiffs point out that Privatbank’s
website and its 2001 Annual Report
state that Privatbank engages in transactions
involving securities issued in the
**United States**. (2001 Annual Report at 3,
attached to Affidavit of Frances E. Bivens
at Exhibit B). There is no allegation that
transactions are related to the claims asserted
here. Accordingly, they are only
relevant to this Court’s determination of
whether the exercise of general jurisdiction
over Privatbank is warranted pursuant
to Rule 4(k)(2) for having such ‘‘continuous
and systematic general business
contacts’’ with **the **United States****. See
Aerogroup Int’l, Inc., 956 F.Supp. at 439.
Because plaintiffs have identified a genuine
issue of jurisdictional fact, the question
of general jurisdiction cannot be resolved
on the pleadings and affidavits
alone. Thus, plaintiffs are entitled to jurisdictional
discovery regarding the extent
of defendant Privatbank’s general business
contacts with **the **United States**** in the
years 1992—1998, a period that includes
the relevant period in this action and five
preceding years. See In re Magnetic Audiotape
Antitrust Litig., 334 F.3d at 207–
08; see also, Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 84
F.3d at 569–70 (holding that the time period
relevant for determining extent of a
defendant’s contacts for general jurisdiction
purpose should include a number of
years prior to the events giving rise to the
claims asserted).
IV. CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, the
Sovereign defendants’ motion to dismiss is
granted in part and denied in part. Plaintiffs’
claims alleging takings in violation of
international law, promissory estoppel, equitable
estoppel, and unjust enrichment—
counts seven, nine, and ten in the complaint—are
hereby dismissed as against
the Sovereign defendants. In addition, the
motion of individual defendants Horath
and Buchmann to dismiss the complaint
for lack of personal jurisdiction is granted
and all claims asserted against those defendants
are hereby dismissed.
Because this Court finds that an issue of
jurisdictional fact exists as to the existence
of general jurisdiction pursuant to Rule
4(k)(2) as to corporate defendant Privatbank,
its motion to dismiss is denied without
prejudice to its renewal pending conclusion
of jurisdictional discovery on that
issue.
