yes , now assume that there i a balancing force. and gravity is merely the result of paticles being pushed

probablity and statistics gets its strengh from the law of large numbers. centrifigal force is a pseudo 
force but not distinguishable in the right frame. . like gravity, lets assume that there is a force pushing 
heads and tails towards a 50 50 distribution. . not merely recording it. regression to the 
mean. etc. would. could be a force similar to the EM one.

Cool. And the former question, of clarification?

Watson's pretty wild and fun, if overconfident about some ideas about autism when I saw him talk —4 
years ago on book tour @Google. I met him once through Gunther Stent, as well as Crick on another 
occasion. Know him well?

1. is probability a force rather than a markter. if you look at a bell curve from scratch, it looks as if 
it under a force pushing things towards the center. i think gravity might be just that. 2. all signals

in nature need to be envvyrpted so that the enemy cannot read. this includes inner signals that if you 
are aware of, can give you up to your predator. so signals from the nose , my conjecture is that each 
person has its own enxruption de encyption algorithm built in. fyi having dinnner with Jin Watson.

Excellent alignment with some of my interests or those of people I like and think are smart! 
The rest of the truncated message has been sent. 
1. What's been stimulating as a source of good questions for the "distributions in nature" issue? 
7. "**Signal** intelligence in biol. systems" seems to cover all of neurophysiology: Jonathan Victor, whom 
you met **a few years ago** in your office, is powerfully thoughtful on the issues of neural coding. Are 
there specific examples that have stimulated you to better questions or turned your thinking around? 
6. Are you aware of apps that purport to play music to enhance productivity and focus on tasks at 
hand? My buddy Reese Jones has backed that; he has a fascinating set of beliefs and projects around 
what may soon be understood as "consciousness hacking." He's on the board of **Singularity University** 
as one of the founders. (His father was a pioneer **UCSF MD** researcher of hallucinogens, I believe!) 
More to come in a **day** or so. 
Thanks! 
You're up late or you're not so east of my SF location! 
**David 
PS** How to trade the Trump-GOP demolition of the welfare state, erratic elevation of risks of trade 
disruptions and war? Has anyone from the rational center or left given thought to how to respond to a 
national emergency to cope with a kakistocratic seizure of emergency powers? The Patriot Act was on 
a 'shelf as you know, ready to be used. What should the better folks in this country have at hand if, 
say, a port is subject to a radiological attack of unknown origin?

**Dear Jeffrey**, 
A Congratulations on another spin around the sun. 
A I would like to offer you a birthday present: my best efforts for a few hours on something where I 
might be able to contribute either to making something good happen for you or help you prevent the 
bad. 
We haven't talked much at all for quite some time, so I'm not sure of the nature of your current 
interests but here are some of mine, where I feel I either have some special capability or can get access 
to those who have such.
