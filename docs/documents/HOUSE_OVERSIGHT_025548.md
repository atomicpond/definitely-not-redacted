Polities and law 
The 2016 presidential campaign was marked by three disclosure operations, all of which appear to 
have had a single author. "Oppo research" is the euphemism commonly used in elections for such 
operations. The mechanism is fairly simple: dirt is obtained from wherever it can be found to 
discredit an opponent. It is then "leaked," usually either anonymously or on background, to targeted 
media channels. What makes the 2016 campaign particularly interesting from a counterintelligence 
perspective is not that both sides had their own disclosure operations, but that both sides were 
offered the dirt for them by a common source: Russian intelligence. 
As we now know from the emails of Donald Trump Jr., a thinly veiled intermediary, Natalya 
Veselnitskaya, offered the Trump campaign documents that putatively would show that Hillary 
Clinton had received illegal donations from Russian financiers; in the event, no such documents 
were proffered. But it is a reasonable assumption that Veselnitskaya could not have made such an 
offer, especially in a meeting attended by three other Russians, unless the move was approved by 
the **FSB**, the Russian security service. 
A second disclosure operation, this one involving supporters of the Clinton campaign, was more 
layered. The proximate intermediary was Fusion GPS, a research firm used by the law firm Baker 
Hostetler, and the secondary "cut-out" was the British firm Orbis, co-founded by former MI-6 
officer Christopher Steele. We know something about this sub-contractor from the depositions 
Steele gave in defending a libel suit in London. According to Steele, Fusion GPS not only had him 
prepare the so-called "dossier" on Trump but also directed Steele to "leak" it to specified reporters 
at Mother Jones, **Yahoo**, **the New York Times**, **the Washington Post**, **The New Yorker**, and **CNN**. In 
some cases, Steele was directed to brief the selected journalists personally. The dirt in these "leaks" 
relied heavily on information supplied by two Russian government sources: Source A, whom Steele 
calls "a senior Russian Foreign Ministry figure"; and Source B, "a former top-level intelligence 
officer still active in the **Kremlin**." Sources A and B provided information supposedly exposing a 
long-time Russian **FSB** operation to get compromising information that could be used to control 
Trump. The idea that two Russian intelligence sources would reveal a long-time **Kremlin**-backed 
**FSB** operation bears further examination.

Michael More11, a former acting **CIA** director, casts light on the sourcing of the dirt in the Steele 
dossier. "I had two questions when I first read [the dossier]," More11 said in an **NBC** interview. 
"One was, how did Chris [Steele] talk to these sources? I have subsequently learned that he used 
intermediaries. I asked myself, why did these guys provide this information, what was their 
motivation? And I subsequently learned that he paid them. That the intermediaries paid the sources 
and the intermediaries got the money from Chris." 
Paying ex-**FSB** officers for sensitive information? As Steele is no doubt aware, there is no such 
thing as an ex-**FSB** officer. All Russian intelligence officers, whether currently or formerly 
employed, if in **Russia**, operate under the same tough security regime. The selling of secret 
information by them is espionage, pure and simple. Selling it to someone connected to an adversary 
intelligence service greatly compounds the crime. Sources A and B (through their intermediaries) 
knew that they were dealing with an ex-MI-6 man who could use their betrayal of secrets against 
them. The only safe way for A and B to provide the requested dirt would be to clear it with the 
security regime at the **FSB**. This precaution, a required step in such exchanges, would mean that the 
dirt in the dossier, whether true or false, was curated by the **FSB** and spoon-fed to Steele. If so, the 
**FSB** was the surreptitious provider of this part of the Steele dossier. 
The third disclosure operation involved stolen emails from the **DNC** bearing on the unfair treatment 
by **Democratic Party** officials of Bernie Sanders, which were posted on the DC Leaks website. 
**President Obama** identified the **Kremlin** as the author of this operation, saying "These data theft 
and disclosure activities could only have been directed by the highest levels of the Russian 
government." If so, as in the previous cases, the **FSB** would have curated the dirt. To be sure, oppo-
research operatives, because of their singular focus on getting usable slime, are highly vulnerable to 
shady offers, but why would **Russia** so blatantly feed the slime to all sides in a campaign?
