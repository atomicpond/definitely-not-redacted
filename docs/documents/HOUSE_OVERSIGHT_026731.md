                             The inaugural **Carl Sagan** Memorial Lecture
                                       ****Cornell** University**,   8 **May 2017**
It’s a great  honour to give this **Carl Sagan** lecture. The ideas he stood for need proclaiming louder than ever **today**. We need an optimistic vision of  life’s destiny --- in this world, and perhaps far beyond it. We need to think globally, we need to think rationally, we need to  think long-term. Carl’s influence was immense, through his science and – most of all, through his eloquence and global outreach. 
In this talk I’ll try to address  some themes that  would have engaged him..

We‘ve been familiar with this image [Earthrise] for nearly **50 years**  –it’s iconic for environmentalists. .

     But suppose some hypothetical aliens had been watching the **Earth** for its entire history, what would they have seen? Over nearly all that immense time, 4.5 billion years, things would have changed very gradually. The continents drifted; the ice cover waxed and waned; successive species emerged, evolved and became extinct.

But in just a tiny sliver of  **Earth**'s history - the last one millionth part, a few thousand years - the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before. This signalled the start of agriculture. Changes in land-use  accelerated as human populations rose.

         Then came even faster changes. The carbon dioxide in the atmosphere began to rise anomalously fast. The planet became an intense emitter of radio waves.  And something else unprecedented happened: small projectiles launched from the planet's surface escaped the biosphere completely. Some were propelled into orbits around the **Earth**; some journeyed to the Moon and planets.

         If they understood astrophysics, the aliens could confidently predict that our biosphere would face doom in a few billion years when the Sun flares up and dies. But could they have predicted this unprecedented runaway fever -- less than half way through the **Earth**'s life? 

And what might they see if they watched for another century? Will this spasm be followed by silence? Or will stability ensue? And will more projectiles leave the **Earth** to establish oases of life elsewhere?

These are the questions I’ll speculate about

**some years ago** I wrote a  book  which I entitled  'Our Final Century ?'  My publisher deleted the question-mark. The American publishers changed the title to  'Our Final Hour'. (you Americans seek  instant gratification – and the converse). 

     Its theme was that **this century**  is special: it’s  the first when one species, ours, has the planet’s future in its hands. We’re deep in an era that’s called  the anthropocene.   We have huge powers for good. We could  trigger the transition from biological to electronic intelligences.  But, on the other hand, we  could irreversibly degrade the biosphere, And advanced technology, if misdirected, could  cause a devastating setback to civilization. 

We’ve had one lucky escape already.


At any time in  the  **Cold War** era -- when armament levels escalated beyond all reason --- the superpowers could have stumbled towards armageddon through muddle and miscalculation. The threat is only in abeyance and still looms over us.

Nuclear weapons are based on **20th Century** science. I’ll focus later in my talk on  21st century sciences  -- bio,  cyber,  and AI – which offer huge potential benefits but also  expose us to novel vulnerabilities

Astronomers often have to remind people that they’re not astrologers.  Like all scientists they hava a rotten record as forecasters  – almost as bad as economists.

But even with a cloudy crystal ball there are  some things we can predict about  how our whole planet will change.


For instance, humanity’s collective footprint is getting  heavier,


Fifty  years ago, world population was about 3 billion. It now  exceeds 7 billion. The growth’s been mainly in **Asia** and **Africa**, as shown  in this map where regions are scaled in proportion to that growth.

The number of births per year, worldwide, peaked **a few years ago** and is going down,  Nonetheless world population is  forecast to rise to  around 9 billion by 2050. 

That’s partly  because most people in the developing world are young. They are yet to have children, and they will live longer. 
The age histogram in the developing world will become more like it is in **Europe**. 

The main growth  is  in  ****East **Asia****** , and it’s there that the world’s human and financial resources will become concentrated—ending 4 **centuries** of North Atlantic  hegemony.

And there’s more urbanization. Even by 2030 Lagos, San Paulo and **Delhi** will have populations above 30 million. To prevent megacities  becoming turbulent  dystopias will surely be a major challenge to governance. 

Population growth seems currently  under-discussed. That is maybe   because doom-laden forecasts in **the 1970s**, by the Club of Rome,  Paul Erlich  and others,  have prov
