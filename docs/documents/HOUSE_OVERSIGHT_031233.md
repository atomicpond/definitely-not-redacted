Importance: High 
OK.. Here it is.. suggestions? 
1. Item 1: I did neck with that woman, but never forced myself on her, and we talked about kissing or going 
beyond that and decided not to. 
2. Item 2: This was what I told you about.. A student who came to me for advice about science 
communication.. I never approached her, or did anything, and have emails rebuffing her requests to meet off 
campus for coffee or meals.. not because they were suggestive, but because I didn't think it was appropriate. I 
did ask her about being a female in a male dominated physics major group because I wanted to find out what 
problems might be occurring. I was respectful of her, and in fact my wife and I gave her a lift later at a AAAS 
meeting that I had helped get her a fellowship to attend. I was shocked later to learn that she had 
complained. There was no official investigation., no formal complaint lodged.. When I spoke to the Dean and 
told her the above, including showing emails, it was agreed that there would be no formal complaint but 
because the student had been upset I would not interact with her at all. I was shocked and dismayed, as I had 
worked very hard to be supportive and mentor this girl 
3. Item 3: I have no idea about this. 
4. This never happened.. In March 2008 at the convention I was approached by a student who did ask to sit at a 
table with the then executive director of the Dawkins foundation. She asked me to join her in the hot tub. I said 
now. Afterwards the exec. director informed me that this person was complaining that I had harassed her, and 
she told me as she was there at the time she would be more than happy to explain that it was quite the opposite. 
5. This was a cruise with Nancy, who was my female companion. When that report appeared I explained that 
my wife Nancy was upset at the allegation as she was my companion and such a complaint could be considered 
libelous, the complaint was removed from the bloggers web site. Moreover, CFI not only continued to invite 
me on cruises but to speak at their events, including this year, where they have strict harassment policies. I 
continue to receive letters of thanks from them for my contributions, attitude, graciousness etc.. No complaints 
ever. Not one! 
6. This one you know about. 
Shall we talk?

Dr. Krauss: 
As you know, I'm a reporter for **BuzzFeed News** who has been investigating sexual misconduct allegations 
against you. As we've already discussed by email, I'd very much like to interview you about these allegations in 
detail. 
In particular, you stated in an email sent on Nov 13 that two universities had investigated an incident (# 6 
below). You claimed that "both Universities independently concluded that the report was unsubstantiated and 
fabricated with malicious intent." We are not aware that either university concluded fabrication or malicious 
intent, so if you have evidence to support this assertion, we would like to see and discuss it. 
**The story concerns your actions towards students while a professor of physics at **Case Western Reserve 
University****, as well as your conduct in non-academic settings as a prominent figure in the skeptics movement. I 
am reporting this story along with two of my colleagues on the science desk, **Azeen Ghorayshi** and **Virginia 
Hughes**. 
Our story is about several allegations of sexual misconduct dating from 2006 to 2016 (see full details below). 
Our reporting also goes into how the various institutions you have been affiliated with — Case Western, 
****Arizona State** University**, **the **Australian National University****, **the New College of the Humanities**, and the Center 
for Inquiry, for which you serve as an honorary member of the board of directors — have handled complaints 
and concerns about your behavior during this time. 
Our story is corroborated by emails, university documents, official complaints, testimony from victims and 
eyewitnesses, and interviews with more than two dozen of your current and former academic colleagues, 
students, and peers in the skeptics movement. 
I wanted to offer you the opportunity to comment and/or respond to the main facts we plan to publish. If you 
wish
```
