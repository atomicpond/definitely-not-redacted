**Dear Jeffrey**, 
As you probably know, Woody Allen's legal team said that we couldn't use the film we shot of him: online, 
for broadcast, anywhere. 
It was a fantastic experience taping with him and so, even if I can't ever use the footage, I'm still grateful to 
you for making the day possible. But of course I'd like to use the footage. I decided when--way back-- we got 
this very negative answer back from his lawyers that I should just take my time about asking --since it would 
take us 2 years to be ready to edit the footage anyway (The online course is chronological. When I taped 
Woody we were still back in 1730. Now we've gotten to **the 1920s**)

Well, we've now arrived at **the season** when we'll be editing materials on William Carlos Williams for our 
course on Modernism and, as we discussed on **Saturday**, on poetry and other arts, The Poetry of Art, Sport, 
and Play 
I would also, of course, love to make a tv episode out of the conversation, but the threshold question is 
whether he'll let us use it for anything at all. In case it would matter, 
Other performers who have already taped with me include 
**John Lithgow**, 
****Diane Paulus** 
Julie** Taymor 
Nas 
Eve **Ensler 
Damian Woetzel** 
Kate Burton 
Lil **Buck Riley 
Alfre** **Woodard 
**Herbie Hancock**** 
Tony Kushner 
Natalia Zukerman 
and those who have agreed to tape with me include 
Sally Field 
**Lena **Dunham 
Yo Yo** Ma** 
**Anna Deveare Smith** 
and more. 
Those in other fields include journalists, senators, president clinton etc etc. You've read my pitch before 
(many times) 
His is one of only two releases that we haven't gotten. What do you think of my chances?
