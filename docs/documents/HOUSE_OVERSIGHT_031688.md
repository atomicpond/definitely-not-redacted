White **HOUSE** National Security Adviser Speaks to Hamas-Linked Group 
**Bill Siegel**  
On March 6, in anticipation of Congressional hearings on domestic radicalization, Deputy National Security Adviser 
Denis McDonough stated the following: 
"President Obama recognizes that through our words and deeds we can either play into al Qaeda's narrative and 
messaging or we can challenge it and thereby undermine it. We're determined to undermine it. For example, we 
know there are many different reasons why individuals—from many different faiths—succumb to terrorist 
ideologies. And there is no one easy profile of a terrorist. But based on extensive investigations, research and 
profiles of the violent extremists we've captured or arrested, and who falsely claim to be fighting in the name of 
**Islam**, we know that they all share one thing—they all believe that **the United States** is somehow at war with 
**Islam**, and that this justifies violence against Americans. So we are actively and aggressively undermining that 
ideology. We're exposing the lie that **America** and **Islam** are somehow in conflict. That is why President Obama 
has stated time and again that **the United States** is not and never will be at war with **Islam**." 
This statement encapsulates so much of what this writer has identified as the "**Control Factor**:" that function of 
our minds which will distort our perceptions so as not to present ourselves with the ever so fearful reality that 
confronts us under the banner of **Islam** **today**. That is, rather than to clearly see, focus upon, and set about to 
create strategies to properly confront the threat which we currently face- a threat that by definition we do not 
control and see little way over which to regain control- our minds essentially collude to reconstruct in a manner 
which deludes us with the sense that we are in control. 
1. The statement essentially reduces the threat we face to that of terrorism caused by **al-Qaeda**. By defining and 
limiting the threat to a band of "radical extremists" who have distorted the doctrine of a great religion, we buy 
into the sense that our military might and criminal detection methods will ultimately save **the day**. The fantasy is 
that this is a problem that we can get our arms around because under our Constitutional principles, terrorism is a 
violation that we are permitted to fight against. 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 031688 
Yet terrorism is only one of three levels upon which the threat is attacking us and **al-Qaeda** is only a piece of the 
terrorism level. The second level, **the "Civilization Jihad**," a term used by **the Muslim Brotherhood** itself to 
describe its long term effort to peaceably infiltrate American and Western society at all levels in order to bring it 
down from the inside through the freedoms that Western Constitutions afford, is well at work and in process 
**today**. This has also been called the "Stealth Jihad." 
There is a third level, the "International Institutional Jihad," upon which organizations such as the UN, along with 
its 57 Member State bloc the Organization of the Islamic Conference, work to push through those principles of 
Sharia Law and Islamic doctrine which it Members can agree upon such as the **1990** Cairo Declaration of Human 
Rights which is fully at odds with U.S. Constitutional tenets. Once these principles become international 
standards, the institutions seek to push them into Western societies through treaties and trade deals over which 
the Members have leverage. 
McDonough's words, by limiting the threat to Al Qaeda, intentionally ignore the other levels of threat which, for 
all intents and purposes can be even more dangerous because our Constitution does not afford us easy means to 
combat. Nor does our desired general sense of morality. 
2. By focusing on "reasons" for this terrorist piece of the pie, **the **Control Factor**** further sets out the narrative 
that we can gain control over the problem. By looking for "root causes," we advance the notion that by 
eliminating or reducing those elements we can eliminate the symptom-terrorism. This is part of a long-engaged 
Leftist narrative that has been utilized across a vast array of social problems in order to gain control over funding 
and policy. Now, it is being used to avoid seeing a problem clearly, much less addressing it intelligently. 
It is this administration's (and also, unfortunately, many members of **Bush**'s as well) distortion to frame terrorism 
as a result of victimhood. That is, by establishing the root causes of terrorism as either a response to U.S. policy, 
to economic conditions, to Israeli occupation, and so on, **the **Control Factor**** sells the buried wish that since we 
cause the conditions, we can fix the symptom without the grueling costs of war and
