Subject: **Oscar** Diary 
It's **Thursday** morning on Wilshire Boulevard and the **Academy** of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has just 
opened it's doors for ticket pick-up for the 85th **Oscar** telecast. 
Forty voting members, the distinguished director Norman Jewison and I are on a long single file line that 
snakes thru the lobby patiently waiting to go upstairs to pick up our tickets. My seats were awarded via 
a lottery system. We clutch our photo I.D. 
Suddenly, a messenger slips in wearing a smart khaki windbreaker and cuts through the line. He announces 
to the uniformed guard in a stage whisper, "**DreamWorks**", and as if ****Steven** Spielberg** himself had just 
delivered the Gettysburg address, is ushered upstairs. 
That is the final act of social justice of the "**Lincoln**" campaign. 
I am sleep deprived and jet lagged having just spent six hours on a flight sitting next Paula Wagner who 
is Tom Cruise's ex-agent turned Broadway producer for Jessica Chastain's "The Heiress". We discuss 
Jessica's not so great chances to beat **Jennifer Lawrence** for Best Actress. I mention **Harvey **Weinstein****'s 
concern about Emmanuel Riva's last minute surge. The French phenomena doesn't speak English, has never 
been to L.A. and it's like voting for a ghost, even on her 86th birthday. 
This is **the year** I got phone calls in **September** from top studio executives announcing each are winning 
the **Oscar**. Their euphoric giddiness is due to the quality of the films resulting in the priciest **Oscar** 
campaigns on record and astounding audience support at the theaters. 
Seven of the nine best picture nominees have taken in well over $100 million at the domestic box office 
to date, but it's the worldwide numbers in the millions that are staggering. 
**Twentieth Century** **Fox**'s "Life of Pi" caused a tsunami at $595, 
**Universal**'s "Les Miserables" scored $412, the **Weinstein** Cos.' "Django Unchained" whipped up $395, 
**DreamWorks**' "**Lincoln**" delivered at $254, **WARNER**'s "Argo" captured $219, **Weinstein**'s "Silver Lining 
Playbook" danced to $187 and **Sony**'s "Zero Dark Thirty" killed at $107 million. 
In comparison, **Sony** Classics' "Amour" received $19 and **Fox** Searchlights' "Beast of the Southern Wild" 
worked up $19 million. 
Hugh audiences having actually seen the films **this year** have an ear for the nuances of the **Oscar** race and 
everyone including Ben Affleck follow the bloggers religiously. 
So by **Thursday** morning on line at the **Academy** the informed buzz was as follows: "Argo" takes best 
picture because is was most entertaining. The director snub to Ben Affleck was a Godsend as George 
Clooney's advice came from far away **Berlin** where he was in pre-production on "The Monuments Men". 
**WARNER**'s president **Sue Kroll** kept the campaign clean and calm on the home front. 
"**Lincoln**'s" victory is Daniel **day** Lewis from **day** one of shooting, no pun intended. The suggestion that 
Obama is our answer to **Lincoln** was interesting. Voters knew Obama secretly hosted three screenings in the 
**White **HOUSE****, but they weren't invited. The **Hollywood** Foreign press were the biggest winners with **Bill 
Clinton**'s surprise appearance on their broadcast. **DreamWorks**' ran an impeccable patriotic campaign that 
the media ate up. 
The best director race had the most drama. **Hollywood** dreaded Spielberg loosing to Ang Lee. (Eventually 
everyone was thrilled **Steven** was anointed president of the Cannes Jury for **2013** **the **day**** after the awards 
show.) 
The voters knew beloved Ang Lee's three year boat ride was the technical miracle. **Fox**'s $595 million 
international box office blew in the win. 
**Harvey **Weinstein**** having three horses running is always the most talked about. His loquacious Quentin 
Tarentino was a lock for screenplay. Best supporting actor was a total toss up with a sentimental edge 
**HOUSE** OVERSIGHT 031118 
to Robert DeNiro. We even applauded **Bob** putting his handprints in cement in front of Grauman's Chinese 
Theater. 
The conversations continued about how our government put the cabasch on "Zero Dark Thirty" with their 
arrogant denial of enhanced interrogation. Even MPAA President Chris Dodd could not help **Mark Boal**, 
Katherine Bigalow and Amy Pascal. 
Additional chatter was the renewed last minute love for "Les Miserables". Clearly the most polarizing 
film in the race, this **27 year old** theatrical musical seen by 60 million fans is now the talk of the 
**Oscar** weekend. 
**Hugh Jackman**, Anne Hathaway, **Russell Crowe**, Amanda Segfried, Eddie Redmayne, Sasha Baron Cohen, Helena 
Bonham Carter and Samanthe Barks ar
