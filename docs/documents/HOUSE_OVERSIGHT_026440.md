So the publisher wants me to trim down 700 to 400 pages in "The Best of..." collection. Tsk tsk. Below will be 
the revised mini-essay to serve as the final piece. Although I detest **Trump**, to be fair, I realized, thanks to 
you, that I had no evidence that he had raped a **13-year-old**, though I did have have evidence that, as an adult, 
there was evidence that she made an accusation. Also, I added another sentence with a positive ending. 
Meanwhile, Happy Earth Day. 
The Last Word: Yikes! 
When **George W. **Bush**** was elected president in **the year 2000**, it was due to **the electoral college** (a rigged system 
which originally intended to prevent slaves from voting and evolved to gerrymandering), even though **Bush**'s 
opponent, **Al Gore**, won the national popular vote. **Hillary Clinton** was elected senator **that year**, and she 
announced that the first thing she would do was to get rid of **the electoral college**. **A few years later**, as a columnist 
for **the New York Press**, I sent her a letter asking about the status of that promise. She didn't reply. 
On November 8, 2016, a crooked businessman, liar extraordinaire, bragging pussy-grabber, make-America-
white-again, anti-choice, anti-Semite, fake Christian, accused rapist of a **13-year-old** in **1994** (she canceled a 
press conference **one week** before the election because of death threats if she filed a lawsuit), climate-change 
hoaxer, **Twitter** addict, homophobic, apprentice politician, fucking fascist, and **Vladimir Putin**'s "useful idiot," 
namely Donald **Trump**, who was elected as an insanely narcissistic dictator based on **the electoral college**, 
whereas his opponent, **Hillary Clinton**, won the national popular vote by almost three million individuals galore, 
to no avail. 
Irony lives. But the monster has inadvertently awakened a population to resist.
