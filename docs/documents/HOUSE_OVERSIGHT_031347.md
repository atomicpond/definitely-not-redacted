Mr. **Epstein**, 
We currently have two negatives on first page in **Google** but one is at 6th and the other at 7th. (Universal 
search, no history applied). Results will be very different if that PC has been used to click or search any of the 
results and has not been cleared. 
How did you pull the results you just sent? 
Using **Google** Chrome + InCognito Mode + Clearing Browser Cache = only reliable reporting. I can help set 
you up with this. Screenshot here of results using above method - http://i.imgur.com/tfGN3Zi.png. This is the 
true representation of what your average searcher will find (statistically, most searches will be from users whom 
have not clicked on your negative articles before) 
Much progress has been made since we spoke - premium placements are getting secured over **next week**, 
hundreds of links have been built to your primary sites and the first movements are kicking in **today** (NYMag 
moved up to 4th a few hours ago). We still have confidence we are on the right track and doing everything we 
can to get this cleaned up - another 45 days should be enough to have a clean first page based on what has been 
done. 
PS - The foundation site was just hacked and I'm in the process of fixing that **today**. You can actually see it in 
the screenshot above (it reads Cash Advance advertisement in the short-description). This is something a 
previous company deployed but we are now going through and securing the rest of the domains to prevent basic 
hijacks like this. 
I'm free on my cell for next few hours. 
Sincerely, 
**Tyler Shears**
