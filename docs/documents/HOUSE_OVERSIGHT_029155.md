﻿FORGIVE ME FOR CONTINUING WITH **PETER**’S RESPONSE TO MY RESPONSE TO **Gordon**’S TWO POSTS. 

I HAVE LEARNED DIRECTLY FROM **PETER** BUT MORE OFTEN INDIRECTLY—HE HAS FORCED ME TO THINK THROUGH MATTERS AND IDENTIFY EXACTLY WHERE HE IS WRONG.

I AM FINISHED WITH THAT NOW. LIFE IS SHORT AND MINE IS GETTING SHORTER BY **the day**, SO I WILL REPEAT MY PIECE AND **PETER**’S RESPONSE TO IT (IN YELLOW) AND THEN MY CURRENT RESPONSE—IN CAPITAL LETTERS.

I AM ALSO ADDING TWO NAMES TO **Gordon**’S LIST. DAVID HAIG WHO IS A BRILLIANT EVOLUTIONARY GENETICIST AT **Harvard** AND **Jeffrey Epstein** WHO IS A BRILLIANT FUND AND INVESTMENT MANAGER (**Palm Beach**, **NYC**, US VIRGIN ISLANDS) WITH BROAD SCIENTIFIC INTERESTS.

Dear Gruterites 

**Gordon** has now brought the argument full circle and given the project a larger meaning.  The most powerful nation on earth, with the greatest power to vent harm—or, in theory, confer benefits—is ruled by an organism that fits the definition of a psychopath—of the narcissistic kind—or a malevolent narcissist. This presents serious dangers that need to be addressed.

**PETER** Richerson has made several valuable points:

1—Causality could go entirely in the other direction than the one I suggested—people avoid more psychopathic relatives the more experience they have had due to closer relatedness. And the paper I attached does not allow discrimination.  The fact that psychopaths show only a weak and insignificant tendency to migrate further from place of birth is mildly interesting but has nothing to do with who is causing any difference in migration.

As far as I can think it through, selection pressures on psychopaths and relatives of psychopaths should be roughly equal and therefore equally likely. **PETER** is biased toward reaction by others, perhaps because of his bias toward “cultural” explanations. First, psychopaths always have the first move in the co-evolutionary struggle and relatives getting out of the way is the next move. Secondly, it is very easy for a psychopath to simply discriminate against harming his relatives but harder for them to study and react. **PETER** claims that they are often spotted early in life which I heartily doubt.


<<On why cultural explanations are important: It is, at root, a simple, fundamental Darwinian point. Evolution works on heritable variation. Human culture is much more variable than human genes, so the scope for cultural evolution is much greater than for genetic evolution. A simple example is the cultural adaptive radiation of humans in the Holocene. We recently spoke about 7,000 languages, most of them associated with more or less distinctive social and subsistence systems. A few languages—Spanish, English, Chinese—are spoken in societies with a great deal of internal social and economic diversity. Culturally we are sort of like thousands of species, but genetically we are only 1. To understand this adaptive radiation without understanding cultural evolution is impossible Boyd and I and our colleagues argue. On the longer **Time** scale the whole human adaptation is all about exploiting cultural evolution to adapt to spatial and temporal variation. See Boyd’s and my Not By Genes Alone: How Culture Transformed Human Evolution (Chicago, **2005**) for the argument in full. Putting scare quotes around culture is simply whistling past the graveyard. If you are a Darwinian you ought to follow the variation, no?


WELL, IS CULTURAL ARGUMENTATION SUFFICIENT WITHOUT GENETIC LOGIC?  FOR EXAMPLE, WE KNOW THAT LANGUAGE AND RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY PER UNIT AREA IS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH INTENSITY OF PARASITE SELECTION. THE STRONGER SUCH SELECTION, THE MORE YOU ARE SELECTED TO AVOID STRANGERS WHO MAY BE CARRYING PARASITES TO WHICH THEY ARE ADAPTED BUT NOT YOURSELF.  

IN GENERAL **PETER**—AS WITH HIS ILK—SEEMS OBLIVIOUS TO THE POWERFUL EFFECTS OF C0-EVOLVING PARASITES ON HUMAN SOCIAL EVOLUITON IN THE PAST 40,000 YEARS.  FOR EXAMPLE, PHONEME DIVERSITY HAS BEEN SHOWN TO OBEY THE SAME RULE AS GENETIC DIVERSITY—AS “WE” MOVED OUT OF ARICA IN THE LATEST WAVE ABOUT 100,000 YEARS AGO—SERIAL FOUNDER EFFECTS REDUCED GENETIC DIVERSITY AND ALSO PHONEMIC DIVERSITY STEADILY FROM THE COMPLEX CLICK-SOUNDS OF THE !KUNG BUSHMEN TO SOUTH AMERICAN LANGUAGES. A VERY RECENT PAPER SHOWS THE MATTER IS MORE COMPLEX IN AN INTERESTING WAY.


“It is, at root, a simple, fundamental Darwinian point. Evolution works on heritable variation. Human culture is much more variable than human genes, so the scope for cultural evolution is much greater than for genetic evolution.”


THIS IS PURE BULLSHIT

THERE IS NO UNIT OF HERITABLE CULTURAL VARIATION. THIS IS JUST A METAPHOR. CAN YOU NAME A UNIT THAT REMAINS CONSTANT OVER AN INDIVIDUAL’S LIFETIME AND THEN IS INHERITED UNCHANGED, ABSENT RECOMBINGATION? OF COURSE NOT. BUT THAT WOULD A TRULY DARWINIAN SYSTEM… 

INCIDENTALLY CANCER DOES EVOLVE IN US BUT IT IS A ONE-GENERATION WONDER, BEING ONLY PASSED ON IN ONLY A COUPLE OF SPECIES OF THE DOG FAMILY (where it has become a sexually transmitted d
