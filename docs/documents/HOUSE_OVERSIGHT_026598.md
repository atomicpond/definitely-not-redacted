The case for naming a U.S. secretary of Culture 
Music critic Mark Swed says it's time we have someone in the **Cabinet** who can 
speak to our common identity: **Arts** and the humanities help us figure out who we 
are. 
By Mark Swed, ****Los Angeles **Times****** Music Critic 
6:00 AM PST, January 19, **2013** 
Along with adding the finishing touches to his 
inaugural address on **Monday**, **President Obama** has 
plenty on his plate. He is consumed by the 
responsibilities of selecting new **Cabinet** members and 
preparing strategies to get them confirmed. He already 
had his fair share of critics, and the last thing he needs 
is a music critic telling him how to run the country. 
So I'm sorry to have to be the one to remind you, **Mr. 
President**, that you've left someone out. Secretary of 
Culture. It's time. 
Despite a troubling international reduction of 
government support for the **Arts** thanks to the world 
economic crises, most countries still manage to 
maintain ministries of culture, and not just seats of 
Western civilization such as **France**, **Italy**, **Spain**, ****Great Britain**** and **Greece** but also in **Albania**, **Brazil**, 
**Haiti**, **Ethiopia**, **Cambodia** and about 50 other countries. We, instead, have the National Endowment 
for the **Arts** and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

I'm a great supporter of these institutions, but I'm calling for their removal and the creation of a new 
**Cabinet**-level agency for culture. The NEA, to which I've been closest in my career, is a wonderful 
organization, doing what it can to support institutions (if no longer individual artists) large and small. 
But it is also a political football and it is always going to be one. 
One of the calls to abolish the NEA, for instance, came from **Mitt Romney** in last year's campaign, as 
part of his proposal to balance the budget But during the debates Obama failed to note that 
investment in the **Arts** is a more reliable jobs creator than in nearly all industries, nor is it easily 
outsourced. That has been an idee fixe of the Obama-appointed outgoing NEA head, Rocco

Landesman. Even so, Landesman's budget got slashed 13% for fiscal 2012 to an embarrassing $146 
million. 
As **Arts** supporters love to point out, that is less than half of the budget the **Pentagon** provides for 
military bands alone. In cash-strapped **France**, on the other hand, Minister of Culture and 
Communication Aurelie Filippetti was enraged when President Francois Hollande cut the **2013** budget 
of her department 4.3% to 7.363 billion euros, which is just under $10 billion. According to 
Landesman, the U.S. remains the weakest funder of **Arts** in the developed world. 
From the start, Obama had seemed a good prospect for becoming an **Arts** president, and four years 
ago, as he was about to assume office, 76,000 people signed a petition, instigated by Quincy Jones, 
begging the new president to create a **Cabinet**-level cultural ministry patterned after **France**'s. He has 
stepped out to **Arts** events and invited artists from many genres to **the ****White House******. But he's kept that 
pretty low profile. The **Arts** can be a lightning rod among populist politicians, and **Washington** is 
divided enough as it is. Clearly Obama has had other preoccupations than cabinetizing culture. But 
that divisiveness is precisely why we need a **Cabinet**-level spokesperson for culture. We have come to 
see ourselves as a country of opposites. The allocation of public funds for just about anything is 
viewed as a war between the rich and the poor. We color our states red or blue. Some of us love guns; 
some of us hate them. Go down the line, and there appears to be less and less on which we agree. 
One thing we do have in common is our identity. Wherever we are on whatever spectrum, we see 
ourselves as Americans. It is that culture that makes everything else matter. The **Arts** and the 
humanities help us figure out who we are. 
A Department of Culture, into which the current NEA and NEH might be folded, may not be 
protected from budgetary vulnerability, but it would at least have more prestige and perhaps more 
stability. It would also empower a public spokesperson for culture. 
Maybe even more essential is the influence a secretary of Culture could have in a way-too-wonky 
**Washington**. I know there aren't regular **Cabinet** meetings anymore where all the secretaries gather 
around a big table and hash out all the issues of the country. Imagine, though, a perfect ****White House****, 
where **Cabinet** officials did often collect, and among them sat a political outsider,
