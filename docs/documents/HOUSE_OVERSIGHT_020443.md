The `Deplorables' Called Into Battle Again 
As midterms near, **President **Trump****'s former political guru Steve Bannon rallies the 
troops

Steve Bannon doesn't do subtle. So it's no surprise that there's nothing subtle about the new movie **President **Trump****'s 
onetime political guru has produced to energize the **Trump** base for **this **year****'s midterm elections. 
It's entitled "**Trump** at War," and it's an hour and 15 minutes of pure Trumpian adrenaline. It opens with a series of shots 
of **Trump** supporters being attacked by angry opponents, shifts to outtakes of **Trump** supporters proudly accepting the 
"deplorables" label bestowed by Hillary Clinton during the **2016** presidential campaign, runs through a long series of 
angry ripostes at **Trump** detractors and praise of administration policy moves, and closes with dire warnings of the need to 
vote for Republicans in **2018** to head off efforts by liberals to impeach the president. 
Mr. Bannon previewed the film for some Republican supporters in **Dallas** recently, but the big premiere is scheduled for 
Sept. 9—chosen because it is the second anniversary of the speech in which Mrs. Clinton used the "basket of deplorables" 
phrase. The location? The very club in **Manhattan** where Mrs. Clinton made the speech, which has been rented for the 
occasion. 
Aside from what they say about Mr. Bannon as a political provocateur, the film and its unveiling also reveal a lot about 
how people in the president's circle increasingly see **this **year****'s midterm election: Its importance is growing every day; 
Republican success starts with turning out core **Trump** supporters; and the best way to motivate them is by brandishing the 
fear of impeachment proceedings if Democrats win control of **Congress**.

"This is all grass roots," Mr. Bannon says. "It's **2016** all over again...This is **Trump**'s first re-election." 
The political calculus behind such thinking is pretty simple: In 19 months as president, Mr. **Trump** has hardened his grip 
on his base of supporters and the **GOP** overall, but has done little to expand that base. 
Meanwhile, as the Labor Day kickoff of the fall campaign approaches, Republicans face a Democratic party whose 
activists appear exceptionally motivated—to campaign, donate money and turn out in **November**. 
Republicans need something to match that fervor. That something is the **Trump** base—and the best motivating tools are 
anger and fear. 
In this case, that means specifically the fear that Special Counsel **Robert Mueller**, New York prosecutors and a 
Democratic **Congress** will conspire to kick Mr. **Trump** out of office. That's why Republicans are talking about the specter 
of impeachment, not Democrats. Democrats know impeachment talk is a surefire way to motivate the other side. 
But there's a problem in this **GOP** formula: A motivated **Trump** base is necessary for Republicans to head off disaster in 
**November**, but it's not sufficient, at least not if Democrats remain as energized as they appear **today**. The **Trump** base has 
to be married with more mainstream Republicans—the kind hardcore activists refer to as RIN0s, or "Republicans In 
Name Only"—and with some independent voters. 
Right now, independent voters are hard to read. Their sentiments have been shifting around a lot in Wall Street 
Journal/**NBC News** polling in **recent months**. As a general rule, they have a low regard for Mr. **Trump** personally and 
appear weary of the atmosphere of constant crisis around him. But the polling also indicates they increasingly like how 
Republicans are handling the economy, appreciate the **GOP** tax cut and think the party is changing the way things work in 
**Washington**. 
That leaves moderate Republicans, of whom Mr. Bannon says simply: "We need RINOs."

The Bannon calculation is that the specter of impeachment will motivate these soft Republicans as well as core **Trump** 
backers. More conventional Republicans may be disdainful of Mr. **Trump** personally, but they also think the tax cuts, 
deregulatory policies and judicial nominations they like are imperiled if he goes down. 
So, impeachment-scare talk, Mr. Bannon is calculating, is effective for RINOS too, simply for different reasons. For th
