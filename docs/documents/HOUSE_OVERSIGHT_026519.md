**Sept** 2 position 
**Sept** 2.nmbtemplate 
Importance: **High 
Hi **Jeffrey****, 
Attached please find the **Sept** 2 position. The realized gain 
increased by the $28 k option premium that resulted from the 
barrier level trading in ****USD**** **JPY**. The ****USD**** sold off vs the **AUD**, 
**GBP** and the **NZD** **today**. The ****USD**** rallied against the **CAD** and the 
**JPY**. 
I have separated y t d p/lfrom **Sept** p/1 so that the numbers mean 
more. 
Hopefully the **AUD** will stay above .88 going into **next monday**. As 
I write this it is approx .9o, which is good. I know it's not **BRL**, but 
I think that we are realizing some good gains. In **the weeks** ahead 
volatility will likely increase as **Congress** considers standing behind 
Obama and attacking **Syria**. Liquidity in restricted currencies can 
disappear at the trader's will. I prefer that we trade liquid easily 
currencies at a time like this.
