Subject: Latest screen shot 
Importance: **High 
This** is the latest screenshot. Mike managed to knock out **daily** beast again. She is a pain and very very persistent. We 
managed to push **Huffington** post down near bottom and is about to be pushed off, but it would take a bit more 
work, and again, you have your active detractors out there. Just the way it is. 
On the second page, we have replaced 8 toxic references with good ones, and there are four toxic ones left, which 
were pushed off the first page. 
The science and org sites would have been placed higher if there was new content created and added. 
Mike, however, is stopping work now on the project. 
We need to talk about island asap, as they are bugging me for logistics. 
Thanks.
