Donald Trump says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the **Miss Universe** pageant in **Russia** 
**CLINTON** attacks Trump's foreign policy as 'dangerously incoherent' 1 / 27U.S. Democratic presidential candidate 
**Hillary **CLINTON**** lambasted **Donald Trump's** foreign policy platform as "dangerously incoherent" in a speech on 
**Thursday** that cast her Republican rival as both a dangerous and laughable figure. 
A former U.S. secretary of state, **CLINTON** attacked Trump for his policies and his character, suggesting Trump 
might start a nuclear war if elected to **the **White House**** simply because "someone got under his very thin skin." 
"**Donald Trump's** ideas are not just different, they are dangerously incoherent," she said to a room of supporters 
in ****San Diego****, **California**. "They're not even really ideas, just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and 
outright lies." 
____0 Mike Blake U.S. Democratic presidential candidate **Hillary **CLINTON**** delivers a speech on national 
security in ****San Diego****, **California**, United States June 2, 2016. 
**CLINTON**, the front-runner in the race to become the Democratic presidential nominee, delivered her speech as 
she seeks to shift her attention to the Nov. 8 election against likely rival Trump and away from Bernie Sanders, 
a U.S. senator from **Vermont**, who is continuing his longshot bid for the nomination. 
Trump, the Republicans' presumptive nominee, has said he would sit down with North Korean leader **Kim Jong** 
Un to try to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program and has criticized the **decades-old** **NATO** alliance with mainly 
European nations as obsolete and too costly for **the United States**. 
**CLINTON** derided these and other positions, promising she would do a better job keeping **the United States** safe 
and standing in front of a backdrop of 19 large U.S. flags, an unusual abundance even by the standards of 
presidential campaign events. 
Trump, a billionaire businessman who has never held elected office or worked in government before, says he 
has experience dealing with foreign governments through setting up hotels, resorts, golf courses and beauty 
pageants in foreign countries. **CLINTON**, who is also a former U.S. senator and former first lady, mocked this. 
"He says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the **Miss Universe** pageant in **Russia**," she said to loud 
laughter. 
Trump has talked tough on foreign policy. He has said he would bring back waterboarding and other brutal 
interrogation techniques for terrorism suspects that are widely regarded as torture and were discontinued by 
Democratic President **Barack Obama**. 
He has also vowed to renegotiate trade deals, called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, and 
said he would ask members of the 28-nation **NATO** alliance to "pay up" or "get out." 
Trump has criticized **CLINTON** for her handling of foreign policy during her 2009-2013 stint as foreign secretary, 
including the Sept. 11, 2012, attack by Islamist militants on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, **Libya**, that 
killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. 
He cites **CLINTON**'s support for **the Iraq war** - launched by former Republican President **George W. Bush** - as 
another example of her shortcomings. 
At a rally Wednesday night in **Sacramento**, **California**, Trump said he had seen a copy of **CLINTON**'s speech and 
"it was such lies about my foreign policy."
