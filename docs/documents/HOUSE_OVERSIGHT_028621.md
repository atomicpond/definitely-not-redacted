Nuclear Operator Raises Alarm on Crisis 
Hiroko Tabuchi — **New York Times** 
The operator of Japan's tsunami-hit nuclear power plant sounded the alarm on the gravity of the deepening crisis of 
containment at the coastal site on Friday, saying that there are more than 200,000 tons of radioactive water in makeshift 
tanks vulnerable to leaks, with no reliable way to check on them or anywhere to transfer the water. 
The latest disclosures add to a long list of recent accidents, leaks and breakdowns that have underscored grave 
vulnerabilities at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant site **more than two years** after a powerful earthquake and 
tsunami set off meltdowns at three reactors. 
They come two weeks after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, promised that his government would take a more active role in 
the site's cleanup, raising questions over how seriously he has taken that pledge. Mr. Abe's government has continued to 
push for a restart of the country's nuclear power program, and he heads to **the Middle East** on Saturday to promote 
Japanese exports to the region, including nuclear technology. 
Mr. Abe also plans to lead Tokyo's delegation to Argentina for the International Olympic Committee's final vote, set for Sept. 
7, on the host city for the 2020 Olympics. Tokyo, 150 miles south of the stricken nuclear power plant, is one of three finalists 
competing to host the games. The others are Istanbul and Madrid. 
Opposition lawmakers here have demanded that Mr. Abe stay home and declare a state of emergency. 
"The nuclear crisis is real and ongoing, yet the government continues to look the other way," said Yoshiko Kira of the 
opposition Japan Communist Party, which made significant gains in parliamentary elections last month. 
"The government should declare a state of emergency right now, and intervene to stop the outflow of contaminated water," 
Ms. Kira said at an anti-nuclear rally outside Mr. Abe's office in Tokyo. 
Mr. Abe remains popular, and it is uncertain how large a liability the crisis at the Fukushima plant will become for him. 
But it has become increasingly clear that the latest problems may be too large for the plant's operator, the Tokyo Electric 
Power Company, or Tepco, to handle. 
Tepco has built nearly 1,000 tanks at the sprawling complex to store as many as 335,000 tons of contaminated water, the 
product of coolant pumped into the reactors to keep their cores from overheating,
