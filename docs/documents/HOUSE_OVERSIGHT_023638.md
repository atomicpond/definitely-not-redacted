﻿a polite interview
“Skin So Thin,
It’s Inside Out”
Ethan Persoff talks with **paul krassner** about running The Realist,
hacking **the **New York **Times****** Bestseller list, and that
“true, extraordinary liar,” Donald Trump.
In the late Fifties, three things radically changed the course
of American comedy: **Lenny Bruce**, The Second City, and
The Realist. From its first issue in the Spring of 1958, Paul
Krassner’s iconoclastic “journal of freethought and satire”
created a comedic template that is still being followed today; its
mix of fact and intelligent opinion delivered with a mordant,
knowing skepticism, is as current as **John Oliver** and as
omnipresent as the entire internet. But you don’t hear much
about The Realist **these days** — it’s the fate of truly seminal
sources to seem inevitable, when in fact they reshaped the
world in their own image.
Fortunately, in 2006 Krassner teamed with archivist/comic
artist Ethan Persoff on The Realist Archive Project (http://
www.ep.tc/realist/), a free online repository of every issue of
the magazine from its **43-year** run. They recently collaborated
again on a deluxe coffee table book, The Realist Cartoons,
published by Fantagraphics.
The election of Donald Trump seemed to be a particularly
Krassnerian moment, so I asked Ethan to call Paul and ask
a few leading questions. — MG
ETHAN PERSOFF: Paul, what’s your opinion of Trump?
**paul krassner**: Where to begin? Personally, for me, it goes
back to when George Bush won the presidency in **2000**. That
was due to **the electoral college**, even though Al Gore had won
the popular vote.
That same time, Hillary Clinton was elected Senator. She
announced, publicly, the first thing she was going to do was
get rid of **the electoral college**.
****years** later**, I was doing a column for **the New York Press**,
and I sent Clinton a letter asking her about the status of her
promise. She didn’t reply.
During the campaign, Trump called Clinton a crook —
EP: Right, “Lock her up”.
PK: —he called her a crooked businessperson. But that’s what
he was. Everything he says about anybody is really about him.
He’s a true, extraordinary liar.
EP: What’s your opinion of his “fake news” media scolding?
PK: Another example of projection. He calls the newspapers
dishonest, because he is, in fact, the most dishonest.
Trump became an insanely narcissistic dictator once he
won, bragging about his electoral numbers as proof. But prior
to that, he endlessly insisted **the electoral college** was a sham.
That, to me, wins the prize for irony.
EP: I have to wonder, what if Clinton had won the electoral
count, but lost the popular vote?
PK: Oh, then he would have said it was rigged.
EP: Lock her up!
PK: When I wrote the letter to her, it was partly because I’d
heard **the electoral college** was based on slavery.
EP: And there’s gerrymandering, which is also racist.
PK: Yes. You know, the thing with Trump, is there’s talk of
anything from impeachment, assassination, treason ... But
that leads to more irony, because that would leave President
Pence. Pence has just as much an interest in turning evolution
around, and going back to barbaric **Times**, but has the ability
to pass as sane. Trump can’t do that.
EP: Do you think Trump’s madness is an asset to his opposition?
He’s such an easily identifiable lunatic, does that provide for
a sense of protection, as opposed to Pence, who is so much
more canny and quiet?
PK: There’s fear of Trump, and then there’s dictatorship in
action. The things he’s been doing are disgusting -- these appointments!
Like **Rick Perry** for Dept of Energy. It’s so insane.
And then, **Betsy DeVos**. No education experience ... I think
even starting in kindergarten. (Laughter)
EP: Yes. Everyone has their own personal thing that they’re
scared about with Trump. Me, it’s the environment. I can’t
believe his appointment of Scott Pruitt with the **EPA**.
PK: They’re all horrible. Then there’s **Michael Flynn**. He
is the core of the hypocrisy of the relationship between
Trumpo the Elephant and Putin.
(continued) f

EP: What’s your take on Trump and
**Russia**?
PK: I read one article where an unidentified
Russian official used the phrase
“useful idiot”. That’s really what it is.
It’s like J. Edgar Hoover; he stayed
around for **decades** [via] blackmail. I
think it’s the same thing. You don’t have
to say it, you know. Hoover would just go
to JFK and say, “We found some photo
of you in bed with Marilyn Monroe. But
don’t you worry, we’ll keep it in our safe.”
EP: You’ve lived through some Red scares;
can you imagine any other time where
this **Russia** stuff would be forgiven?
PK: I think foreign countries may have
influenced previous elections.
I don’t know, but it was mostly
before the technology of the
Internet. So, if there’s no Internet,
there ain’t no hackin’.
It’s like there ain’t no divorce
if you don’t have no marriage!
Whatever deal was made, or
hacked, I think Trump decided
to run the night of the 2011
**Washington** Correspondent’s
Dinner. Obama had such
good jokes that night. But the
camera was on Trump, and
