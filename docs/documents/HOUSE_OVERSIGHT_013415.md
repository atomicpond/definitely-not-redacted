Palm Beach sex offender's secret plea deal: 
Possible co-conspirators not charged, presses 
victims to settle civil suits 
By SUSAN SPENCER-WENDEL 
**Palm Beach Post Staff** Writer 
Friday, September 18, 2009 
**West Palm Beach** — Billionaire financier sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's secret non-prosecution agreement he 
struck with federal prosecutors was unsealed Friday, offering the first public look at the deal Epstein's high-powered 
legal counsel brokered on his behalf. 
According the agreement, **the **Federal Bureau** of Investigation** and the U.S. Attorney's Office investigated Epstein 
for various federal crimes, including prostitution, some punishable by a minimum of 10 years up to life in prison 
But federal prosecutors backed down and agreed to recall grand jury subpoeanas, if Epstein pleaded guilty to 
prostitution-related felonies in state court, which he ultimately did. He received an 18-month jail sentence, of which 
he served 13. 
A former federal prosecutor of 15 years, Mark Johnson of Stuart, said the disparity in the potential sentences was 
unusual. 
**the **United States**** Attorney's Office also agreed not to charge any of Epstein's possible co-conspirators - Sarah 
Kellen, **Adriana Ross**, Lesley Groff and Nadia Marcinkova. 
The agreement was negotiated in part by New York heavyweight criminal defense attorney **Gerald Lefcourt**. 
On its first draft in **September 2007**, it required that Epstein pay an attorney - tapped by the U.S. Attorney's Office 
and approved by Epstein - to represent some of the victims in civil suits they had filed against Epstein. That 
attorney is prominent Miami lawyer Bob Josefsberg. 
Former prosecutor Johnson said he has never seen a provision like that before. 
But an addendum to the agreement signed **the following month** struck Epstein's duty to pay Josefsberg if he and the 
victims did not accept a settlement and instead pursued litigation. 
The agreement, signed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Maria Villafana, does not expressly state whether any victims 
were contacted or consulted before the deal was made. 
Attorney **Brad Edwards** of **Fort Lauderdale**, who represents three of the young women, believes that none of the 
between 30 and 40 woman identified as victims in the federal investigation were told of the deal. Edwards said his 
clients were still receiving letters in the mail months afterwards saying the U.S. Attorney's Office assuring them 
Epstein would be prosecuted. 
"Never consulting the victims is probably the most outrageous aspect of it..." Edwards said. "It taught them that 
someone with money can buy his way out of anything. It's outrageous and embarrassing for **United States** 
Attorney's Office and the State Attorneys Office." 
Epstein now faces many civil lawsuits filed by the women, who are represented by a variety attorneys. In many, the 
facts alleged are the same: that Epstein had a predilection for teenage girls, identified poor, vulnerable ones and 
lured them to his home via other young women. The teens describe ascending a staircase lined with nude 
photographs of young girls and to the spa room where Epstein would appear in a small towel. 
Former Circuit Judge Bill Berger, who represents one of the victims, and **The Palm Beach Post** sought the 
unsealing of the agreement. Berger refers to it as a "sweetheart deal." 
"Why was it so important for the government to make this deal?" Berger asked rhetorically. "We have not yet had 
honest explanation by any public official as to why it was made .. and why the victim's were sold down the river." 
Former federal prosecutor Ryon McCabe described the agreement as "very unorthodox." Such agreements, he said, 
are usually reserved for corporations, not individuals.
