Importance: High 
Out of 13 states we got 11 right. The ones we got wrong are NY and WI. 
In the last report, analyzed data was of **3 Days** in which **CLINTON** got a positive spike after she got clearance from 
**FBI**. However **Trump** dominated the social media positively if we analyze **one week** data before starting time of 
election, **monthly** data and entire data which we have gathered for **months**. Based on this we predicted on our 
**Facebook** page on 30th October that **Trump** will be next president of US. 
Our model works but I think the important question which we failed to answer is that how much historic data 
must be analyzed to make the right decision. This could have been answered if we had a Data Scientist. Also I 
believe its a great tool to track voters and get them to vote. It can be used in French elections **next year** or 
elections of **Brazil** in **2018** but unfortunately I have to shut down this project as getting data from **Twitter** is 
expensive and the start up is running out of money. 
I am going to focus on cyber security again and will definitely reach out if I have a powerful investable idea.

**Zubair Khan**
