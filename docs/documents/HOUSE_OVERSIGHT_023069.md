﻿Equity Strategy Focus Point
Death and tax reform
Quantitative Analysis
29 January 2017 Corrected

Deep dive on corporate tax reform
OK, maybe it’s not as inevitable as death and taxes, but some form of corporate tax
reform seems likely. It is a stated priority of President Trump and has widespread
Congressional support. We here focus on four components that could have big equity
implications. We assess the impacts at a market, sector, and industry level, and plan to
update and augment this work as more details come to light.
Potential near-term boost to EPS, long-term impact varies
Our 2018 S&P 500 EPS estimate of $137 already implies healthy two-year growth of +16%.
Tax reform in its entirety could add as much as $5-6 to near-term EPS, as benefits are frontloaded.
The sustained impact depends: under a 20% tax rate, the Blueprint would be
modestly accretive; under a 15% rate, this annual benefit could triple; but a 25% tax rate that
would appease the deficit hawks could shave $3.50 off of earnings each year. We also
estimate a one-time $8-9 charge to GAAP EPS associated with the repatriation tax (Table 1).
Cutting corporate tax rate could add $8 to EPS
Our starting point is the US statutory corporate tax rate. If it were lowered from 35% to
20% and the US moved to a territorial tax system (no longer taxing foreign profits), it
would boost S&P 500 EPS by an estimated 12% ($17 to 2018 EPS). We assume
companies would be able to retain half of the benefit ($8) and the remainder would be
passed on to customers or competed away. For instance, a lasting impact to Utilities'
profits is unlikely, as the benefit would be passed on via regulated pricing.
Repatriation: Buybacks could boost EPS by 3%
Both Trump and the Blueprint support a mandatory (as opposed to 2004's optional) tax
of overseas earnings of US firms’ subsidiaries at reduced rates. Non-Financials in the S&P
hold at least $1.2tn in overseas cash (mostly Tech and Health Care). If half was used for
buybacks, this could add 3% ($4) to S&P 500 EPS. A redux of 2004 where companies
used 80% of cash for buybacks may be less likely, in our view. For if repatriation is
accompanied by an end to interest expense deductions, companies may choose to pay
down debt over buybacks.
Border adjustment tax (BAT) hits EPS by $5-6
While Trump has described the BAT as being “too complicated,” White House press
secretary Spicer’s recent comments call into question his stance. This is a key
component of the Blueprint and would generate significant revenue. First-order impacts
could be significant, with border adjustments detracting $5-6 from 2018 EPS — nearly
80% of the drag comes from the consumer sectors. The second order impacts — product
pricing, pricing within the supply chain, exchange rates, foreign policy reactions, etc. —
while harder to quantify, are important to consider.
End to interest deductibility could detract 4% from EPS
We estimate that over time, the removal of the interest expense deduction would
detract about 4% from S&P 500 EPS. An increase in the cost of debt by an incremental
25% could have longer term ramifications for capital structures and funding..
Tax reform winners and losers
We include stock screens for potential beneficiaries and victims of tax cuts, repatriation
and interest deductibility changes, as well as industries most helped/hurt most by a BAT.
Note that the very fact that there are companies and industries that have the potential
to be very negatively impacted could call into question the likelihood of passage.
BofA Merrill Lynch does and seeks to do business with issuers covered in its research reports. As a
result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a conflict of interest that could affect the
objectivity of this report. Investors should consider this report as only a single factor in making
their investment decision.
